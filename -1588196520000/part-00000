The robots could shoot flame arrows, launch TNT blocks and shoot down incoming missiles. After the Mega Gargantua fight, Cubehamster wanted them to \"turn [it] into a game which focuses on firing missiles at each other and trying to blow them up\". In Missile Wars, players receive items which they can use to spawn missiles, and blow up, stop and defuse incoming missiles. Players can jump on missiles and ride them across the playfield. Cubehamster said that \"subtle techniques\" involving missile mechanics had made the game popular. According to Cubehamster, Missile Wars was built in two weeks and thoroughly tested afterwards.

The video footage used for training MariFlow contains interactive sessions in which SethBling occasionally takes control of the character.

The robots could shoot flame arrows, launch TNT blocks and shoot down incoming missiles. After the Mega Gargantua fight, Cubehamster wanted them to \"turn [it] into a game which focuses on firing missiles at each other and trying to blow them up\". In Missile Wars, players receive items which they can use to spawn missiles, and blow up, stop and defuse incoming missiles. Players can jump on missiles and ride them across the playfield.

The congregation moved to another building built in the [[Greek Revival]] style in 1906, and in 1964 moved to a more modern building, out of which they still operate.\n\nThe congregation was initially made up of only ten families but grew to include 50 members by 1878. By the time their second building was built in 1906, the congregation included 82 members, and Meridian as a whole had grown to include 525 Jewish residents by 1927. By the 2000s there were fewer than forty, mostly elderly Jews remaining in the city, however, and the congregation no longer has a full-time rabbi. Former rabbis include Judah Wechsler, after whom the [[Wechsler school]] was named, and William Ackerman, whose wife [[Paula Ackerman]] became the first woman to perform rabbinical duties in the country after her husband's unexpected death.\n\nIn 1968, the education building of the new complex was bombed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Pieces of glass were salvaged from the destruction and are now incorporated into the front windows of the current synagogue building. The congregation owns and maintains a historic cemetery at 19th Street and 15th Avenue which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.\n\n==History==\nIn the early days of [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]] before Meridian was established, the nearby town of [[Marion, Mississippi|Marion]] was the largest settlement in the area.<ref name=bethhistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/HistoryofMeridianCongregations.htm |title=History of Congregations Beth Israel &  Ohel Jacob, Meridian, Mississippi |work=Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities |publisher=[[Institute of Southern Jewish Life]] |accessdate=2010-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005093325/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/HistoryofMeridianCongregations.htm |archivedate=2007-10-05 }}</ref> The families of Abraham Threefoot, Isaac Rosenbaum, Leopold Rosenbaum, E.

Krouse]] and modelled after the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] was built at the corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue. The marble steps leading to the entrance of the building were flanked by large [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns. The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying the [[Ten Commandments]], a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], the [[Star of David]], and [[Noah's Ark]]. A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation, and while it was being repaired, services were held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. By 1907, the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin. By 1927, the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people, partly due to an influx of immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers, helping them to find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English.<ref name=bethhistory/>\n\nSome of the congregation's members had preferred a more strict form of worship and a smaller [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] congregation, Ohel Jacob, had been formed in 1895.

co-ordinator and representative of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) within the [[European Union]] (EU). The position is currently held by [[Josep Borrell]].\n\nThe post was created under the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] as the '''High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy'''; it then was occupied by [[Javier Solana]] for ten years, until it was aggrandised following the [[Lisbon Treaty]], providing a seat on the [[European Commission]], and a chair of the [[Foreign Affairs Council|council of EU foreign ministers]]. Following the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], the post is assisted by the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS) that was set up in December 2010.<ref name=\"eeas\">Gateway to the European Union, [http://eeas.europa.eu/background/index_en.htm European External Axis Service] \u2013 accessed 16 February 2011</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nThe formal title of the '''High Representative''' is \"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\". This post was previously styled as '''High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy''' and, under the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], had been designated to be titled the '''Union Minister for Foreign Affairs'''. This latter title, as '''EU Foreign Minister''' is still applied by commentators and sections of the media as a publicly recognisable shorthand for the post. The style '''High Representative''' equates to that of [[High Commissioner]] in diplomatic circles. Since the High Representative is ex officio a Vice-President of the European Commission, the office-holder is sometimes referred to as the '''HR/VP'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/24982/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-joint-press-conference-foreign-minister-russian-federation-sergey_en|title=Remarks by HR/VP Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov  \u2013 EEAS \u2013 European External Action Service \u2013 European Commission|website=EEAS \u2013 European External Action Service}}</ref>\n\n==Role==\n{{Politics of the European Union}}\nWhere foreign matters are agreed between [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. The Representative co-ordinates the work of the [[European Union Special Representative]]s as well as other appointments such as anti-terrorist co-ordinator.\n\nBeside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], the High Representative is:\n* ''[[ex-officio]]'' [[Vice-President of the European Commission]]\n* participant in the meetings of the [[European Council]]\n* responsible of the European Union Special Representatives\n* head of the [[European External Action Service|External Action Service]] and the [[Foreign relations of the European Union#Diplomatic representation|delegations]]\n* President of the [[Foreign Affairs Council]]\n* [[Secretary-general]] of the [[Western European Union]] (prior to the abolition of the WEU on 30 June 2011)\n* Head of the [[European Defence Agency]]\n* Chairperson of the board of the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]\n\nAccording to proposals made in 2009 by the Swedish EU presidency, the High Representative will control the staffing and budget of the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], and propose the size of budget to be allocated. The High Representative is responsible for appointing EEAS staff and for controlling general foreign policy (outside of trade, development and enlargement which has to be made together with the Commission) including security initiatives and intelligence sharing. However, although the High Representative may prepare initiatives, decisions will still have to be taken by the member states in Council. The High Representative would also have to report to Parliament.<ref name=\"23Oct\">Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer</ref>\n\nWhile there has been some criticism of the vague division of powers between the EU's top players, Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The [[President of the European Commission]] speaks as the EU's \"government\" while the [[President of the European Council]] is a \"strategist\". The High Representative specialises in \"bilateral relations\" while the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine (here, Veselovsky makes a mistake, as [[free trade area|FTA]]s are actually part of the [[EU's common commercial policy]] for which the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] is responsible).

At an informal meeting in Finland it was mooted that they could serve as special envoys on the High Representative's behalf. This has been backed by Ashton who said that so long as the EU spoke with one voice, it didn't matter who was speaking.<ref>Mahony, Honor (15 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29676 EU foreign ministers ponder their post-Lisbon role], EU Observer</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe post was introduced under the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]].

Although the Constitution failed to be ratified, its replacement, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], retained the change under a different name.

It was decided that the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary-General of the Council]] would be the High Representative. This meant that the Secretary-General at the time, [[J\u00fcrgen Trumpf]] was the first High Representative, although he would only serve a few months.\n\nThe first permanent High Representative was [[Javier Solana]], former [[Secretary General of NATO]]. He was appointed on 4 July 1999 at the [[List of European Councils#Cologne 1999|Cologne European Council]] as Council Secretary-General and High Representative. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post had a budget of \u20ac40&nbsp;million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. During his tenure, the position was expanded rapidly, with several more functions combined into the function of High Representative. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of [[Western European Union]] (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He has also become president of the [[European Defence Agency]].\n\nThe [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of [[Henry Kissinger]]'s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In December 2003 Solana released the [[European Security Strategy]], which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004 Solana appointed [[Gijs de Vries]] as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], and outlined his duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU's fight against terrorism.\n\nHe has negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Colombia. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that Montenegro form a union with Serbia instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a [[domino effect]] from Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]] independence demands. Local media sarcastically named the new country \"Solania\".\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Khanty-Mansiysk 26-27 June 2008-11.jpg|thumb|Javier Solana with the [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in 2008.]]\n\nOn 21 January 2002 Solana said that the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] should be treated as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Convention]]. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi invasion]] through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU [[Security Council]] members, were in [[Iraq disarmament crisis|disagreement]]. The so-called [[Vilnius letter]], a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States' aim of r\u00e9gime change in Iraq, and [[the letter of the eight]], a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six-second-tier countries, are generally seen as a low-water mark of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. Solana operated as a quiet diplomat and found himself frequently pushed to the side in negotiations and sent on missions known to be impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/29069|title=EU's quiet diplomat steps aside after 10 years}}</ref>\n\nSolana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], and continues to be a primary architect of the \"[[Road map for Peace]]\", along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. On 22 July 2004 he met [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet Solana, but eventually accepted that, whether he liked it or not, the EU was involved in the Road Map. He criticised Israel for obstructing the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election]] of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.\n\nIn November 2004 he assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with Iran. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the [[Timeline of the Orange Revolution|post-election developments]] in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine's new President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] to discuss future EU membership.<ref name=Waging>Clark, Wesley K.

After numerous candidates were put forward, EU leaders agreed on [[Catherine Ashton]] from the United Kingdom as the first merged High Representative. Ashton was previously the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] and otherwise had no foreign affairs experience. Ashton unexpectedly came to the top of the shortlist when she was nominated unanimously by the centre-left leaders who claimed the post.<ref>Rettman, Andrew [http://euobserver.com/9/29022 Little-known British peer emerges as top candidate for EU foreign minister], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref><ref>Mahony, Honor [http://euobserver.com/9/29024 EU chooses unknowns for new top jobs], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref> Ashton was confirmed by the European Parliament before she took up the post.

There they agreed on \u20ac3&nbsp;million in aid, to look for further financial assistance, to send personnel to assess the situation and to co-ordinate pledges from member states. Ashton then chaired a meeting of member states' ambassadors and acted as a general co-ordinator; for example contacts from the UN went via Ashton. Although she refused to describe it as the first act of the external action service, Ashton did emphasise that it was the first time that such a co-ordination between all the various EU foreign policy actors had been accomplished before. Spain, which held the rotating Council presidency that would have taken charge before the Lisbon Treaty, took a back seat though assisted, for example by offering use of the Spanish base in Panama. However, the majority of aid relief was dealt with bilaterally between Haiti and individual member states<ref>Rettman, Andrew (14 January 2009) [http://euobserver.com/24/29266 EU foreign relations chief tests new powers in earthquake response], EU Observer</ref> and Ashton was criticised afterward for being one of the few foreign representatives not to travel to Haiti personally.<ref>Mahony, Honor (19 January 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29299 Ashton under fire for not going to Haiti], EU Observer</ref> Despite EU ministers then agreeing to deploy [[European Gendarmerie Force|European gendarmes]], criticism was levied at Ashton for failing to improve the EU's international profile during the crisis. Ashton replied stating that \"There's been a recognition from the people of Haiti, the US, the UN and others of the extremely important role the EU has played.

It represents a problem for the EEAS, when it comes to public diplomacy, and reflects the system we have for choosing leaders. Too often, the EEAS is waiting until the last member state signs up to the position; they could set out a view much earlier. When you look at places like Egypt \u2013 Cathy has been five times, but people are still not quite sure what the EEAS does or who speaks for Europe. The glass is less than half full.

'''High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy''' ('''HR/VP''') is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) within the [[European Union]] (EU). The position is currently held by [[Josep Borrell]].\n\nThe post was created under the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] as the '''High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy'''; it then was occupied by [[Javier Solana]] for ten years, until it was aggrandised following the [[Lisbon Treaty]], providing a seat on the [[European Commission]], and a chair of the [[Foreign Affairs Council|council of EU foreign ministers]]. Following the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], the post is assisted by the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS) that was set up in December 2010.<ref name=\"eeas\">Gateway to the European Union, [http://eeas.europa.eu/background/index_en.htm European External Axis Service] \u2013 accessed 16 February 2011</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nThe formal title of the '''High Representative''' is \"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\". This post was previously styled as '''High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy''' and, under the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], had been designated to be titled the '''Union Minister for Foreign Affairs'''. This latter title, as '''EU Foreign Minister''' is still applied by commentators and sections of the media as a publicly recognisable shorthand for the post. The style '''High Representative''' equates to that of [[High Commissioner]] in diplomatic circles. Since the High Representative is ex officio a Vice-President of the European Commission, the office-holder is sometimes referred to as the '''HR/VP'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/24982/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-joint-press-conference-foreign-minister-russian-federation-sergey_en|title=Remarks by HR/VP Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov  \u2013 EEAS \u2013 European External Action Service \u2013 European Commission|website=EEAS \u2013 European External Action Service}}</ref>\n\n==Role==\n{{Politics of the European Union}}\nWhere foreign matters are agreed between [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. The Representative co-ordinates the work of the [[European Union Special Representative]]s as well as other appointments such as anti-terrorist co-ordinator.\n\nBeside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], the High Representative is:\n* ''[[ex-officio]]'' [[Vice-President of the European Commission]]\n* participant in the meetings of the [[European Council]]\n* responsible of the European Union Special Representatives\n* head of the [[European External Action Service|External Action Service]] and the [[Foreign relations of the European Union#Diplomatic representation|delegations]]\n* President of the [[Foreign Affairs Council]]\n* [[Secretary-general]] of the [[Western European Union]] (prior to the abolition of the WEU on 30 June 2011)\n* Head of the [[European Defence Agency]]\n* Chairperson of the board of the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]\n\nAccording to proposals made in 2009 by the Swedish EU presidency, the High Representative will control the staffing and budget of the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], and propose the size of budget to be allocated. The High Representative is responsible for appointing EEAS staff and for controlling general foreign policy (outside of trade, development and enlargement which has to be made together with the Commission) including security initiatives and intelligence sharing. However, although the High Representative may prepare initiatives, decisions will still have to be taken by the member states in Council. The High Representative would also have to report to Parliament.<ref name=\"23Oct\">Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer</ref>\n\nWhile there has been some criticism of the vague division of powers between the EU's top players, Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The [[President of the European Commission]] speaks as the EU's \"government\" while the [[President of the European Council]] is a \"strategist\". The High Representative specialises in \"bilateral relations\" while the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine (here, Veselovsky makes a mistake, as [[free trade area|FTA]]s are actually part of the [[EU's common commercial policy]] for which the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] is responsible).

At an informal meeting in Finland it was mooted that they could serve as special envoys on the High Representative's behalf. This has been backed by Ashton who said that so long as the EU spoke with one voice, it didn't matter who was speaking.<ref>Mahony, Honor (15 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29676 EU foreign ministers ponder their post-Lisbon role], EU Observer</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe post was introduced under the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]].

It was decided that the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary-General of the Council]] would be the High Representative. This meant that the Secretary-General at the time, [[J\u00fcrgen Trumpf]] was the first High Representative, although he would only serve a few months.\n\nThe first permanent High Representative was [[Javier Solana]], former [[Secretary General of NATO]]. He was appointed on 4 July 1999 at the [[List of European Councils#Cologne 1999|Cologne European Council]] as Council Secretary-General and High Representative. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post had a budget of \u20ac40&nbsp;million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. During his tenure, the position was expanded rapidly, with several more functions combined into the function of High Representative. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of [[Western European Union]] (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He has also become president of the [[European Defence Agency]].\n\nThe [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of [[Henry Kissinger]]'s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In December 2003 Solana released the [[European Security Strategy]], which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004 Solana appointed [[Gijs de Vries]] as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], and outlined his duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU's fight against terrorism.\n\nHe has negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Colombia. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that Montenegro form a union with Serbia instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a [[domino effect]] from Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]] independence demands. Local media sarcastically named the new country \"Solania\".\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Khanty-Mansiysk 26-27 June 2008-11.jpg|thumb|Javier Solana with the [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in 2008.]]\n\nOn 21 January 2002 Solana said that the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] should be treated as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Convention]]. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi invasion]] through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU [[Security Council]] members, were in [[Iraq disarmament crisis|disagreement]]. The so-called [[Vilnius letter]], a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States' aim of r\u00e9gime change in Iraq, and [[the letter of the eight]], a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six-second-tier countries, are generally seen as a low-water mark of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. Solana operated as a quiet diplomat and found himself frequently pushed to the side in negotiations and sent on missions known to be impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/29069|title=EU's quiet diplomat steps aside after 10 years}}</ref>\n\nSolana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], and continues to be a primary architect of the \"[[Road map for Peace]]\", along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. On 22 July 2004 he met [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet Solana, but eventually accepted that, whether he liked it or not, the EU was involved in the Road Map. He criticised Israel for obstructing the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election]] of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.\n\nIn November 2004 he assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with Iran. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the [[Timeline of the Orange Revolution|post-election developments]] in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine's new President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] to discuss future EU membership.<ref name=Waging>Clark, Wesley K.

After numerous candidates were put forward, EU leaders agreed on [[Catherine Ashton]] from the United Kingdom as the first merged High Representative. Ashton was previously the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] and otherwise had no foreign affairs experience. Ashton unexpectedly came to the top of the shortlist when she was nominated unanimously by the centre-left leaders who claimed the post.<ref>Rettman, Andrew [http://euobserver.com/9/29022 Little-known British peer emerges as top candidate for EU foreign minister], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref><ref>Mahony, Honor [http://euobserver.com/9/29024 EU chooses unknowns for new top jobs], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref> Ashton was confirmed by the European Parliament before she took up the post. In the same European Council meeting, [[Pierre de Boissieu]] was appointed [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union]], showing that the High Representative and the Secretary-General will no longer be the same person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111343.pdf|title=Press release, European Council 2009-11-19}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2010 most major appointments to the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]] were made, including [[Pierre Vimont]] (France) as Secretary General, Helga Schmid (Germany) and Maciej Popowski (Poland) as Deputy Secretary Generals and [[David O'Sullivan (civil servant)|David O'Sullivan]] (Ireland) as chief operating officer.

There they agreed on \u20ac3&nbsp;million in aid, to look for further financial assistance, to send personnel to assess the situation and to co-ordinate pledges from member states. Ashton then chaired a meeting of member states' ambassadors and acted as a general co-ordinator; for example contacts from the UN went via Ashton. Although she refused to describe it as the first act of the external action service, Ashton did emphasise that it was the first time that such a co-ordination between all the various EU foreign policy actors had been accomplished before. Spain, which held the rotating Council presidency that would have taken charge before the Lisbon Treaty, took a back seat though assisted, for example by offering use of the Spanish base in Panama. However, the majority of aid relief was dealt with bilaterally between Haiti and individual member states<ref>Rettman, Andrew (14 January 2009) [http://euobserver.com/24/29266 EU foreign relations chief tests new powers in earthquake response], EU Observer</ref> and Ashton was criticised afterward for being one of the few foreign representatives not to travel to Haiti personally.<ref>Mahony, Honor (19 January 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29299 Ashton under fire for not going to Haiti], EU Observer</ref> Despite EU ministers then agreeing to deploy [[European Gendarmerie Force|European gendarmes]], criticism was levied at Ashton for failing to improve the EU's international profile during the crisis. Ashton replied stating that \"There's been a recognition from the people of Haiti, the US, the UN and others of the extremely important role the EU has played. On the main issue, we should ask, have we tried to save lives, to support the people of Haiti?

He also supported her over Syria and has asked her to stand for a second term. Polish Minister for Europe, [[Miko\u0142aj Dowgielewicz]], also stated criticism against Ashton was \"a lot of hot air\" and that \"she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well.

It represents a problem for the EEAS, when it comes to public diplomacy, and reflects the system we have for choosing leaders. Too often, the EEAS is waiting until the last member state signs up to the position; they could set out a view much earlier. When you look at places like Egypt \u2013 Cathy has been five times, but people are still not quite sure what the EEAS does or who speaks for Europe. The glass is less than half full.
