The abundance of this tree, especially in [[Guanacaste Province]], [[Costa Rica]], where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the [[national symbol|national tree]] of [[Costa Rica]].\n\nIn [[North America]] it is often called '''elephant-ear tree''', due to the shape of the seedpods. Other common names include '''Devil's ear''' and '''earpod tree''', '''''parota''''' and '''''orej\u00f3n''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or '''''huanacaxtle''''' ([[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]). In [[El Salvador]], it is known as '''''conacaste'''''.<ref>Witsberger ''et al.'' (1982)</ref> In the Yucatan peninsula, it is known by the Mayan name, '''''pich.''''' In Panama it is known as '''corot\u00fa'''. \n\n== Description<ref>Niembro Rocas (2002), Harmon (2008), PIER (2008)</ref> ==\n\nThe guanacaste is a medium-sized to large [[tree]], growing to 25\u201335&nbsp;m tall, with a  trunk up to 3.5 m in diameter. Unusual in a tree of these proportions, buttresses are completely lacking. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is light gray, with prominent dark reddish-brown vertical fissures. In young trees these fissures are closer together. and their confluence lends a characteristic reddish hue to the bark of guanacaste saplings. Older specimens often present broken, chipped or scarred bark.\n\nThe crown is broad and widely spreading. The height at which branches first occur along the trunk \u2013 as well as the overall tree shape \u2013 vary considerably among individuals and are habitat-dependent characteristics. Frequently, guanacaste trees grow as single specimens in a sunny pasture. Under these conditions, massive, extended, horizontal limbs emerge low on the boles, forming giant, hemispherical, widely spreading crowns. In the forest (where competition for light is intense) trees tend to become taller, and branching occurs at a higher level. Tree forms then become somewhat narrower, though crowns are still rounded, and hemispherical shapes are maintained by those that have reached the canopy.\n\nThe alternate [[leaf|leaves]] are bipinnate compound, 15\u201340&nbsp;cm long and 17&nbsp;cm broad with a 2\u20136&nbsp;cm [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] bearing 4\u201315 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40\u201370 leaflets; the leaflets are slender oblong, 8\u201315&nbsp;mm long by 2\u20134&nbsp;mm wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, raised, oval gland. The leaves are confined to the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful enough to make it moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is [[evergreen]], or briefly [[deciduous]] for 1\u20132 months during the [[dry season]]. Most foliage is shed in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April.\n\nConcurrent with the leaves' renewal is the appearance of globular [[inflorescence]]s (3&nbsp;cm) in the axils of the new leaves. Supported by a long pedestal (4&nbsp;cm), each spherical white head \u2013 composed of about fifty individual flowers \u2013 sports thousands of thin, filamentous stamens as its major feature. The blossoms themselves each consist of about twenty stamens and a single pistil, bound together at the base by a short, green, tubular corolla and an even shorter calyx, just 5&nbsp;mm long altogether. Guanacaste flowers are very fragrant, and during intense flowering periods their odor permeates the air for many meters in all directions. In Manuel Antonio National Park near Quepos, Costa Rica, flowering lasts from late February to early April.\n\nSurprisingly, no obvious fruiting activity immediately follows the decline of the blossom. Rather, nine or ten months pass before small, green pods first appear high in the crown by December. They reach full size by February and finally begin to ripen in March \u2013 a full year after flowering has ceased. Fruit ripening lasts from March to April, as the green pods turn brown in the guanacaste crown and are slowly shed. Vigorous trees will produce large crops on a nearly annual basis. In June, guanacaste seedlings can already be seen, germinating in the moist soil of the early rainy season.\n\nGuanacaste fruits are large (7\u201312&nbsp;cm diameter), glossy dark brown [[indehiscent]] and spirally-organized pods, shaped like orbicular disks. Their shape suggests the usual [[Mimosoideae]] fruit \u2013 a long, narrow, flattened pod \u2013 taken and wound around an axis perpendicular to its plane. Made of thick, soft tissue with a leathery feel, the pods contain 8-20 radially arranged seeds, 14.5\u201317.5&nbsp;mm long, 7.8\u201311.2&nbsp;mm wide, and 6.2\u20137.2&nbsp;mm thick and weighing about 1&nbsp;g. Guanacaste seeds are brown and marked with a conspicuous light brown or orange ring. They are very hard, resembling small stones rather than tree seeds in their strength and durability. In order for germination to occur, the hard seed coat must be broken to enable water to reach the embryo. Otherwise, the seeds will lie dormant indefinitely.\n\nThe ardillo (''[[Cojoba arborea]]'') and the iguano (''[[Dilodendron costaricense]]'') possess similar bipinnate leaves with extra-fine leaflets. Though of equally impressive stature, these two trees can be distinguished readily from the guanacaste: the ardillo has tan-colored, heavily wrinkled and rough bark \u2013 nothing like the guanacaste's unmistakably gray and vertically cracked cortex. The iguano's leaflets are serrate (an unusual feature in a bipinnate tree), while those of the guanacaste are entire.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Enterolobium.JPG|right|thumb|240px|Branches and foliage of a young ''Enterolobium cyclocarpum'', about 3 years old, in Naiguata, Venezuela]]\nGuanacaste trees appear to delay the onset of fruit development\u2014some nine months\u2014so that seed maturation will coincide with the start of the rainy season. This adaptive behavior presumably is an adaptation to give germinating seedlings as much time as possible to establish root systems before the start of the next dry season. Both the [[Hymenaea courbaril|jatob\u00e1]] (''Hymenaea courbaril'') and the cenizaro (''[[Albizia saman]]'') exhibit similar reproductive strategies. Of course, guanacaste trees\u2014like all [[deciduous]] and [[semi-deciduous]] species in this part of the world\u2014share in the water-conserving benefits of [[dry-season]] leaflessness.\n\nGuanacaste flowers are heavily visited by [[bee]]s\u2014insects that probably are responsible for pollination as well. Guanacaste seed pods, however, are completely ignored by native fauna and they accumulate on the forest floor underneath parent trees. The seeds are not eaten by any animals currently native where the tree occurs,<ref>Harmon (2008)</ref> rendering the plant an [[Evolutionary anachronism#The megafauna dispersal syndrome|evolutionary anachronism]]: it has been suggested that guanacaste pods were among the foods exploited by certain species of [[Pleistocene megafauna]] that became [[Quaternary extinction event|extinct]] some 10,000 years ago (e.g. [[Ground sloth#Megatheriidae|giant ground sloths]], [[Bison latifrons|giant bison]]).<ref>Janzen & Martin (1982)</ref> Within this scenario, the tree remains today without an effective seed-dispersing vector besides humans.\n\nAs discussed above, the tough-coated guanacaste seeds do not begin to grow unless their protective covers are punctured in some way. This may be an adaptation designed to keep the seeds from germinating while still in the pods at the start of the [[rainy season]]\u2014and very likely still underneath the parent tree after having fallen from its crown. With more time to find them, foraging ground sloths (and other extinct mammals) could eat the pods and transport the seeds to a new site. The resulting mastication and digestion of the fruits would induce seed coat abrasion, which would help seed germination. Nowadays this role of mastication and dispersal has been taken up primarily by [[horses]] and [[cattle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Enterolobium cyclocarpum|url=http://eol.org/pages/642271/details|website=eol.org|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn insect [[pest (organism)|pest]], common to guanacaste trees of the [[Costa Rican Central Valley]], produces spherical green [[gall]]s of 1.5&nbsp;cm diameter on new shoots in February and March.

The abundance of this tree, especially in [[Guanacaste Province]], [[Costa Rica]], where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the [[national symbol|national tree]] of [[Costa Rica]].\n\nIn [[North America]] it is often called '''elephant-ear tree''', due to the shape of the seedpods. Other common names include '''Devil's ear''' and '''earpod tree''', '''''parota''''' and '''''orej\u00f3n''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or '''''huanacaxtle''''' ([[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]). In [[El Salvador]], it is known as '''''conacaste'''''.<ref>Witsberger ''et al.'' (1982)</ref> In the Yucatan peninsula, it is known by the Mayan name, '''''pich.''''' In Panama it is known as '''corot\u00fa'''. \n\n== Description<ref>Niembro Rocas (2002), Harmon (2008), PIER (2008)</ref> ==\n\nThe guanacaste is a medium-sized to large [[tree]], growing to 25\u201335&nbsp;m tall, with a  trunk up to 3.5 m in diameter. Unusual in a tree of these proportions, buttresses are completely lacking. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is light gray, with prominent dark reddish-brown vertical fissures. In young trees these fissures are closer together. and their confluence lends a characteristic reddish hue to the bark of guanacaste saplings. Older specimens often present broken, chipped or scarred bark.\n\nThe crown is broad and widely spreading. The height at which branches first occur along the trunk \u2013 as well as the overall tree shape \u2013 vary considerably among individuals and are habitat-dependent characteristics. Frequently, guanacaste trees grow as single specimens in a sunny pasture. Under these conditions, massive, extended, horizontal limbs emerge low on the boles, forming giant, hemispherical, widely spreading crowns. In the forest (where competition for light is intense) trees tend to become taller, and branching occurs at a higher level. Tree forms then become somewhat narrower, though crowns are still rounded, and hemispherical shapes are maintained by those that have reached the canopy.\n\nThe alternate [[leaf|leaves]] are bipinnate compound, 15\u201340&nbsp;cm long and 17&nbsp;cm broad with a 2\u20136&nbsp;cm [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] bearing 4\u201315 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40\u201370 leaflets; the leaflets are slender oblong, 8\u201315&nbsp;mm long by 2\u20134&nbsp;mm wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, raised, oval gland. The leaves are confined to the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful enough to make it moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is [[evergreen]], or briefly [[deciduous]] for 1\u20132 months during the [[dry season]]. Most foliage is shed in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April.\n\nConcurrent with the leaves' renewal is the appearance of globular [[inflorescence]]s (3&nbsp;cm) in the axils of the new leaves. Supported by a long pedestal (4&nbsp;cm), each spherical white head \u2013 composed of about fifty individual flowers \u2013 sports thousands of thin, filamentous stamens as its major feature. The blossoms themselves each consist of about twenty stamens and a single pistil, bound together at the base by a short, green, tubular corolla and an even shorter calyx, just 5&nbsp;mm long altogether. Guanacaste flowers are very fragrant, and during intense flowering periods their odor permeates the air for many meters in all directions. In Manuel Antonio National Park near Quepos, Costa Rica, flowering lasts from late February to early April.\n\nSurprisingly, no obvious fruiting activity immediately follows the decline of the blossom. Rather, nine or ten months pass before small, green pods first appear high in the crown by December. They reach full size by February and finally begin to ripen in March \u2013 a full year after flowering has ceased. Fruit ripening lasts from March to April, as the green pods turn brown in the guanacaste crown and are slowly shed. Vigorous trees will produce large crops on a nearly annual basis. In June, guanacaste seedlings can already be seen, germinating in the moist soil of the early rainy season.\n\nGuanacaste fruits are large (7\u201312&nbsp;cm diameter), glossy dark brown [[indehiscent]] and spirally-organized pods, shaped like orbicular disks. Their shape suggests the usual [[Mimosoideae]] fruit \u2013 a long, narrow, flattened pod \u2013 taken and wound around an axis perpendicular to its plane. Made of thick, soft tissue with a leathery feel, the pods contain 8-20 radially arranged seeds, 14.5\u201317.5&nbsp;mm long, 7.8\u201311.2&nbsp;mm wide, and 6.2\u20137.2&nbsp;mm thick and weighing about 1&nbsp;g. Guanacaste seeds are brown and marked with a conspicuous light brown or orange ring. They are very hard, resembling small stones rather than tree seeds in their strength and durability. In order for germination to occur, the hard seed coat must be broken to enable water to reach the embryo. Otherwise, the seeds will lie dormant indefinitely.\n\nThe ardillo (''[[Cojoba arborea]]'') and the iguano (''[[Dilodendron costaricense]]'') possess similar bipinnate leaves with extra-fine leaflets. Though of equally impressive stature, these two trees can be distinguished readily from the guanacaste: the ardillo has tan-colored, heavily wrinkled and rough bark \u2013 nothing like the guanacaste's unmistakably gray and vertically cracked cortex. The iguano's leaflets are serrate (an unusual feature in a bipinnate tree), while those of the guanacaste are entire.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Enterolobium.JPG|right|thumb|240px|Branches and foliage of a young ''Enterolobium cyclocarpum'', about 3 years old, in Naiguata, Venezuela]]\nGuanacaste trees appear to delay the onset of fruit development\u2014some nine months\u2014so that seed maturation will coincide with the start of the rainy season. This adaptive behavior presumably is an adaptation to give germinating seedlings as much time as possible to establish root systems before the start of the next dry season. Both the [[Hymenaea courbaril|jatob\u00e1]] (''Hymenaea courbaril'') and the cenizaro (''[[Albizia saman]]'') exhibit similar reproductive strategies. Of course, guanacaste trees\u2014like all [[deciduous]] and [[semi-deciduous]] species in this part of the world\u2014share in the water-conserving benefits of [[dry-season]] leaflessness.\n\nGuanacaste flowers are heavily visited by [[bee]]s\u2014insects that probably are responsible for pollination as well. Guanacaste seed pods, however, are completely ignored by native fauna and they accumulate on the forest floor underneath parent trees. The seeds are not eaten by any animals currently native where the tree occurs,<ref>Harmon (2008)</ref> rendering the plant an [[Evolutionary anachronism#The megafauna dispersal syndrome|evolutionary anachronism]]: it has been suggested that guanacaste pods were among the foods exploited by certain species of [[Pleistocene megafauna]] that became [[Quaternary extinction event|extinct]] some 10,000 years ago (e.g. [[Ground sloth#Megatheriidae|giant ground sloths]], [[Bison latifrons|giant bison]]).<ref>Janzen & Martin (1982)</ref> Within this scenario, the tree remains today without an effective seed-dispersing vector besides humans.\n\nAs discussed above, the tough-coated guanacaste seeds do not begin to grow unless their protective covers are punctured in some way. This may be an adaptation designed to keep the seeds from germinating while still in the pods at the start of the [[rainy season]]\u2014and very likely still underneath the parent tree after having fallen from its crown. With more time to find them, foraging ground sloths (and other extinct mammals) could eat the pods and transport the seeds to a new site. The resulting mastication and digestion of the fruits would induce seed coat abrasion, which would help seed germination. Nowadays this role of mastication and dispersal has been taken up primarily by [[horses]] and [[cattle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Enterolobium cyclocarpum|url=http://eol.org/pages/642271/details|website=eol.org|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn insect [[pest (organism)|pest]], common to guanacaste trees of the [[Costa Rican Central Valley]], produces spherical green [[gall]]s of 1.5&nbsp;cm diameter on new shoots in February and March.

It aired on [[NBC]] from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting a total of nine seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/office/ |title=Shows A-Z - The Office on NBC |website=The Futon Critic |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref> It is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the original [[BBC]] [[The Office (British TV series)|series of the same name]] and was adapted for American television by [[Greg Daniels]], a veteran writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It was co-produced by Daniels's [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J. Novak]] as the main cast, however, the series experienced [[List of The Office (American TV series) characters|numerous changes]] to its [[ensemble cast]] during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.

It was co-produced by Daniels's [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006.

According to Dan Smith, the song is written as a conversation between two victims of the eruption, stating in an interview, \"I was reading a book that had some picture of the people who got caught up in the volcanic eruption. And it\u2019s just such a kind of dark powerful image, and it got me thinking about how boring it must have been emotionally after the event. To be sort of stuck in that same position for hundreds and hundreds of years.

{"title_page": "Abortion in Colombia", "text_new": "Prior to 2006, abortion in Colombia was illegal without exceptions. Therapeutic abortion to save a mother's life was permitted between 1837 and 1936. <ref name=\"c355-06\">{{cite court|court=Constitutional Court|vol=Sentencia C-355/06|date=10 May 2006|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2006/c-355-06.htm}}</ref> As of 2006, only in the following circumstances, which remain in effect to this day. These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980. (Penal Code)</big>'''\n\n\"ARTICLE 343. ABORTION. The woman who causes her abortion or allows another to cause it, shall be in prison for one to three years.\n\nThe same sanction shall be subject to who, with the consent of the woman, performs the act provided for in the preceding paragraph. \" \n\n===Sentence C-133 of 1994===\n\nThe constitutionality of Article 343 of the 1980 Penal Code was challenged to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] in 1994, which ruled in favour of the article criminalizing abortion in sentence C-133 of March 17, 1994. The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception.<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. <ref name=\":2\" />A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections.<ref name=\":2\" /> The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004.<ref name=\"penalcode\" /> Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent ''or'' on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislation (2015 - current) ===\nIn November 2015, [[Attorney general of colombia|Attorney General]] [[Eduardo Montealegre]] announced that he would send a bill to Congress legalizing abortion on request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception.<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. <ref name=\":2\" />A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections.<ref name=\":2\" /> The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

His father, Drayton McLane Sr, owned a wholesale grocery distribution center. At age nine, he went to work for his father's business that had been established by his grandfather, Robert McLane, in 1894.

While still a child, Garner entertained soldiers during World War I. By the time he was a teenager in the 1920s, he had already decided upon a career on the vaudeville stage. \n\n==Mousie Garner and the Three Stooges==\n\nStage star [[Ted Healy]] worked with three rowdy stooges (showbiz slang for \"asistants\"): [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Shemp Howard]] (and later [[Curly Howard]]). When Howard, Fine, and Howard chose to work on their own, first in 1930 and later in 1934 as \"[[The Three Stooges]]\", Healy promptly replaced them with three ''new'' stooges. Mousie Garner worked alongside his cousin, Jack Wolf (father of [[Warner Wolf]]) and Richard \"Dick\" Hakins between 1922 and 1936.<ref name=bio/> Mousie Garner continued working on stage and on screen with Dick Hakins, and either his cousin Jack Wolf or Wolf's replacement, Sammy Wolfe, in a musical comedy trio known as The Gentlemaniacs (aka: Garner, Wolf [or Wolfe] and Hakins) throughout the 1920s and '30s. The Gentlemaniacs starred in several feature films and short subjects including ''After the Show'' (1929), ''Swing It Professor'' (1937), ''The Hit Parade'' (1937), ''Murder With Reservations'' (1938) and ''Radio and Relatives'' (1940). Garner, however, did ''almost'' became one of the Three Stooges for two occasions. \n\nAccording to Garner's autobiography, after Shemp Howard died suddenly in November 1955, Moe Howard and Larry Fine wanted Garner to join them in 1956, but Garner was then under contract to [[Spike Jones]] as a musical comedian with Jones's band, the City Slickers.
