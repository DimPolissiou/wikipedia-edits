Referred to by the Dutch as the first (of two) \"''[[Politionele acties]]''\" (''''Police Actions''''). In Indonesia, the military offensive is more commonly known in history books and military records as '''''Agresi Militer Belanda I''''' (First Dutch Military Aggression).\n\nThe offensive was launched in violation of the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] between the Republic and the Netherlands. The offensive resulted in the Dutch reducing Republican-held areas to smaller areas of Java and Sumatra, split by Dutch-held areas.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, p. 99\"/>\n\n==Background==\nFollowing Dutch assertions that Indonesia cooperated insufficiently in the implementation of the [[Linggadjati Agreement]], which had been ratified on 25 March 1947 by the lower chamber of the Dutch parliament. This police action was also influenced by a Dutch perception that the Republic had failed to curb the influence of [[Indonesian Chinese]], [[Indonesian Indian]]s and the rising [[Indonesian Communist Party]].<ref name=\"Kahin27\">Kahin (2003), p. 27</ref>\n\nThe 100,000 inactive Dutch soldiers in Java was a significant financial burden on the Netherlands after the ravages of World War II.<ref name = \"Ricklefs225\">Ricklefs (1991), p. 225</ref> By May 1947, the Dutch had decided they needed to directly attack the Republic to access commodities in Republican-held areas, in particular sugar in Java and oil and rubber in Sumatra. The Dutch military estimated they would need two weeks to secure Republican-held cities and six months for the whole of the Republican territory.<ref name = \"Ricklefs225\">Ricklefs (1991), p. 225</ref> The offensive was intended to not include an attack on [[Yogyakarta]], seat of the Republican government, due to high expected costs of fighting there.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==The Offensive==\nOn 21 July, the Dutch deployed three divisions in Java and three brigades in less-densely populated [[Sumatra]]. The operation resulted in the occupation of large parts of Java and Sumatra, with the Republican army (TNI) offering only weak resistance.<ref name=\"Jackson23\">Jackson (2008), p. 23</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the TNI and its allies continued to conduct guerilla operations from the hills in Dutch-controlled territory. The Dutch retaliated with air strikes and a blockade of Republican-held areas.

Referred to by the Dutch as the first (of two) \"''[[Politionele acties]]''\" (''''Police Actions''''). In Indonesia, the military offensive is more commonly known in history books and military records as '''''Agresi Militer Belanda I''''' (First Dutch Military Aggression).\n\nThe offensive was launched in violation of the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] between the Republic and the Netherlands. The offensive resulted in the Dutch reducing Republican-held areas to smaller areas of Java and Sumatra, split by Dutch-held areas.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, p. 99\"/>\n\n==Background==\nFollowing Dutch assertions that Indonesia cooperated insufficiently in the implementation of the [[Linggadjati Agreement]], which had been ratified on 25 March 1947 by the lower chamber of the Dutch parliament. This police action was also influenced by a Dutch perception that the Republic had failed to curb the influence of [[Indonesian Chinese]], [[Indonesian Indian]]s and the rising [[Indonesian Communist Party]].<ref name=\"Kahin27\">Kahin (2003), p. 27</ref>\n\nThe 100,000 inactive Dutch soldiers in Java was a significant financial burden on the Netherlands after the ravages of World War II.<ref name = \"Ricklefs225\">Ricklefs (1991), p. 225</ref> By May 1947, the Dutch had decided they needed to directly attack the Republic to access commodities in Republican-held areas, in particular sugar in Java and oil and rubber in Sumatra. The Dutch military estimated they would need two weeks to secure Republican-held cities and six months for the whole of the Republican territory.<ref name = \"Ricklefs225\">Ricklefs (1991), p. 225</ref> The offensive was intended to not include an attack on [[Yogyakarta]], seat of the Republican government, due to high expected costs of fighting there.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==The Offensive==\nOn 21 July, the Dutch deployed three divisions in Java and three brigades in less-densely populated [[Sumatra]]. The operation resulted in the occupation of large parts of Java and Sumatra, with the Republican army (TNI) offering only weak resistance.<ref name=\"Jackson23\">Jackson (2008), p. 23</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the TNI and its allies continued to conduct guerilla operations from the hills in Dutch-controlled territory.

Four officers from the Brooklyn North police command had received a tip that a drug deal was about to take place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, stood in front of the apartment building. Serpico climbed up the fire escape, entered by the fire escape door, went downstairs, listened for the password whispered at the apartment door, then followed two suspects downstairs and outside.<ref name=\"Gadfly\">{{cite web |date=January\u2013February 2001 |url= http://gadflyonline.com/home/index.php/frank-serpico-the-fate-that-gnaws-at-him/|title=Frank Serpico: The fate that gnaws at him| website= GadflyOnline.com |accessdate=October 25, 2007|first=Kathleen F.|last=Phalen}}</ref>\n\nThe police arrested the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley stayed with the suspects, and Roteman told Serpico, who spoke Spanish, to make a fake purchase attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping his hand on his revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers behind him and on the stairs ignored him.<ref name=\"Gadfly\"/>\n\nSerpico was then shot in the face by the inside suspect with a [[.22 LR]] pistol.

He was visited the day after the shooting by Mayor John V. Lindsay and Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], and the police department harassed him with hourly bed checks.

Serpico, who was armed during the drug raid, had been shot only after briefly turning away from the suspect, when he realized that the two officers who had accompanied him to the hallway and door of the scene were not following him into the apartment or providing support and back-up, raising the question whether Serpico had actually been brought to the apartment in February 1971 by his colleagues to be betrayed and murdered. There was no formal investigation.<ref name=\"politico\"/>  Edgar Echevarria, who had shot Serpico, would subsequently be convicted of attempted murder.<ref> https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/01/archives/the-man-who-shot-serpico-is-convicted-in-brooklyn.html</ref>\nThree months later, on May 3, 1971, ''New York Metro Magazine'' published an article, \"Portrait of an Honest Cop\", about him, a week before he testified later at the departmental trial of an NYPD lieutenant accused of taking bribes from gamblers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n====Testimony before the Knapp Commission====\nLater that year in October, and again in December 1971, Serpico testified before the Knapp Commission:<ref name=\"Gadfly\"/>\n{{quote|Through my appearance here today&nbsp;...

It was the largest district by area in the state before the formation of [[Tirupur District]] in 2009. The headquarters of the district is [[Erode]]. It is divided into two revenue divisions, [[Erode division|Erode]] and [[Gobichettipalayam division|Gobichettipalayam]], and is further subdivided into 10 [[Tehsil|taluks]]. Erode District, then known as, was a part of [[Coimbatore District]] before its division into two on September 17, 1979. It covers an area of {{Convert|5,722|km2}}, and [[2011 Census of India|as of 2011]], had a population of 2,251,744 .\n\n==History==\nThe region belonging to present-day Erode District was ruled successively by several South Indian dynasties, including the [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]]. During the first millennium, it was under the rule of the Chera Dynasty and various other rulers. Between the 10th to 12th centuries, the region was part of the larger [[Chola Empire]]. The region became part of [[Vijayanagara empire]] in the 14th century, then under the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] until the 17th century. Under the Madurai Nayaks, the [[Polygar]] system of administration was established. The Polygar system continued after the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe Polygar chieftain [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]], a governor of the region, played a major role in the early struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence]] in the late 18th-century [[Polygar Wars]] against the [[British East India Company]]. After the Polygar and Mysore Wars in the late 18th century, the area came under the control of the British until the achievement of [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947. It was a part of the erstwhile [[Coimbatore district]] until its split in 1979.\nErode\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Erode District had a population of 2,251,744 with a sex-ratio of 993 females for every 1,000 males, above the national average of 929.<ref name=\"dashboard\">{{cite web|title=Census Info 2011 Final population totals|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/censusinfodashboard/index.html|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|year=2013|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> A total of 195,213 were under the age of six, constituting 99,943 males and 95,270 females.

To the east, across the [[Kaveri River]], lies [[Salem District|Salem]] and [[Namakkal District|Namakkal]] districts. To the southeast lies [[Karur District|Karur]] district. [[Tirupur District]] lies immediately to the south. [[Coimbatore District|Coimbatore]] and [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]] districts lie to the west.\n\nErode District is [[landlocked]], and is situated at between latitude 10 36\" and 11 58\" north and between longitude 76 49\" and 77 58\" east. The district forms the meeting point of the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]] mountain ranges, separated by the [[Bhavani River]].\n\nThe district comprises a long undulating plain, sloping gently towards the Kaveri River in the south-east. The three major tributaries of the Kaveri, the [[Bhavani River|Bhavani]], [[Noyyal]] and [[Amaravati River|Amaravati]], run across the long stretch of mountains in the north. In combination with these rivers, numerous canals, the [[Bhavanisagar Dam]] and the [[Kodiveri Dam]] provide irrigation and drainage for Erode.\n\n[[File:Bhavani-sagar-Dam-and-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|[[Bhavanisagar Dam]] across [[Bhavani River]]]]\n[[File:Cauvery at Erode.JPG|thumb|[[Kaveri River]] at [[Erode]]]]\n\n=== Bhavani River ===\n{{Main|Bhavani River}}\nThe Bhavani River rises in the [[Western Ghats]] of the [[Silent Valley National Park]] in the [[Palakkad District]] of [[Kerala]]. It is joined by the [[Siruvani River]], a perennial stream of [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore District]], and is joined by the [[Kundha River]] before entering Erode District in [[Sathyamangalam]]. The Bhavani is [[perennial river]], mostly fed by the southwest monsoon but also supplemented by the northeast monsoon. It runs for over one hundred miles through Erode District, crossing [[Bhavani taluk|Bhavani]] and [[Gobichettipalayam taluk|Gobichettipalayam]] taluks. Near [[Gobichettipalayam]] lies the [[Kodiveri Dam]], a mini-dam constructed for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe river eventually feeds the [[Bhavanisagar dam|Bhavanisagar reservoir]], and then takes an easterly course after crossing Sathyamangalam taluk. Along with another tributary, the Amutha Nathi River, the Bhavani River ultimately joins the [[Kaveri|Kaveri River]] in [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu]]. A confluence of three rivers, such as this one, is known as a ''[[Triveni Sangam]]'' in Hindu belief. The place where the Bhavani River joins with the Kaveri River is famous for the Sri Sangameshwara Temple of [[Lord Shiva]], where, in accordance to [[Hindu]] customs, people perform the last rites for deceased friends and family.\n\n=== Kaveri River ===\n{{Main|Kaveri River}}\nThe Kaveri River rises in the Western Ghats of [[Kodagu]] (Coorg) District in Karnataka, and is joined by many small tributaries. It runs eastward through Karnataka, and is joined by its main tributary, the [[Kabini River]], before taking a sharp southbound turn at [[Hogenakkal Falls]]. From here, it runs towards the southeast, forming the boundary between Bhavani taluk of Erode District and [[Tiruchengode]] taluk of the neighbouring [[Namakkal]] District. The Bhavani River joins the Kaveri River at the town of Bhavani.\n\n==Climate==\nUnlike nearby [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore District]], Erode District's climate is characterized by dry weather throughout the year, except during the monsoons, when it receives high rainfall. The cool, moist wind that passes through the [[Palghat Gap]] in the [[Western Ghats]] has a moderating effect on the climate of neighbouring Coimbatore district, but the air loses its coolness and becomes dry by the time it reaches Erode.\n\nGenerally, the first two months of the year are pleasant, but in March the temperature begins to rise, which persists until the end of May, when the highest temperatures are normally recorded. The few rain showers during this period do not provide much relief from the heat. However, the temperature reverses its rising trend during the pre-monsoon period, between June and August. By September, the monsoon rains begin to fall. The northeast monsoon sets in vigorously during October\u2013November. By December, the rains end, returning the climate to its dry and cold state.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Erode District Collector's Office.jpg|thumb|upright|Erode District Collector's Office]]\nFor administrative purposes, Erode District is divided into ten [[taluk]]s under two revenue divisions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NPR Report: Tamil Nadu: Erode|year=2011|publisher=National Population Register, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/NprStateReport.aspx?stcd=33&distcd=09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428071506/http://censusindia.gov.in/NprStateReport.aspx?stcd=33&distcd=09|archivedate=28 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* '''[[Erode division]]''' : [[Erode taluk]], [[Kodumudi taluk]], [[Modakurichi taluk]], [[Perundurai taluk]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Kodumudi, Modakurichi and Thalavadi taluks take off|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kodumudi-modakurichi-and-thalavadi-taluks-take-off/article8329438.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n* '''[[Gobichettipalayam division]]''' : [[Anthiyur taluk]], [[Bhavani taluk]], [[Gobichettipalayam taluk|Gobichettipalayam taluk]], [[Sathyamangalam taluk|Sathyamangalam taluk]], [[Nambiyur|Nambiyur taluk]], [[Thalavadi taluk]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Anthiyur becomes separate taluk in Erode district|date=22 November 2012|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anthiyur-becomes-separate-taluk-in-erode-district/article4125457.ece|accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nErode District consists of one [[Municipal corporations in India|municipal corporation]] and four other municipalities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/cma/municipalities/municipalities_gradewise.html |title=List of Municipalities |work=Government of Tamil Nadu |access-date=8 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202828/http://www.tn.gov.in/cma/municipalities/municipalities_gradewise.html |archivedate=28 September 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Erode Municipal Corporation]]\n* [[Gobichettipalayam Municipality|Gobichettipalayam Selection Grade Municipality]]\n* [[Sathyamangalam]] Grade-I municipality\n* [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu|Bhavani]] Grade-II municipality\n* [[Punjai Puliampatti]] Grade-II municipality\n\n==Politics==\nErode District is divided into 3 Parliamentary Constituencies of the [[Lok Sabha]]: [[Erode (Lok Sabha constituency)|Erode]], [[Nilgiris (Lok Sabha constituency)|Nilgiris]] and [[Tirupur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Tirupur]].

It was the largest district by area in the state before the formation of [[Tirupur District]] in 2009. The headquarters of the district is [[Erode]]. It is divided into two revenue divisions, [[Erode division|Erode]] and [[Gobichettipalayam division|Gobichettipalayam]], and is further subdivided into 10 [[Tehsil|taluks]]. Erode District, then known as, was a part of [[Coimbatore District]] before its division into two on September 17, 1979. It covers an area of {{Convert|5,722|km2}}, and [[2011 Census of India|as of 2011]], had a population of 2,251,744 .\n\n==History==\nThe region belonging to present-day Erode District was ruled successively by several South Indian dynasties, including the [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]]. During the first millennium, it was under the rule of the Chera Dynasty and various other rulers. Between the 10th to 12th centuries, the region was part of the larger [[Chola Empire]]. The region became part of [[Vijayanagara empire]] in the 14th century, then under the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] until the 17th century. Under the Madurai Nayaks, the [[Polygar]] system of administration was established. The Polygar system continued after the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe Polygar chieftain [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]], a governor of the region, played a major role in the early struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence]] in the late 18th-century [[Polygar Wars]] against the [[British East India Company]]. After the Polygar and Mysore Wars in the late 18th century, the area came under the control of the British until the achievement of [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947. It was a part of the erstwhile [[Coimbatore district]] until its split in 1979.\nErode\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Erode District had a population of 2,251,744 with a sex-ratio of 993 females for every 1,000 males, above the national average of 929.<ref name=\"dashboard\">{{cite web|title=Census Info 2011 Final population totals|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/censusinfodashboard/index.html|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|year=2013|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> A total of 195,213 were under the age of six, constituting 99,943 males and 95,270 females.

To the east, across the [[Kaveri River]], lies [[Salem District|Salem]] and [[Namakkal District|Namakkal]] districts. To the southeast lies [[Karur District|Karur]] district. [[Tirupur District]] lies immediately to the south. [[Coimbatore District|Coimbatore]] and [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]] districts lie to the west.\n\nErode District is [[landlocked]], and is situated at between latitude 10 36\" and 11 58\" north and between longitude 76 49\" and 77 58\" east. The district forms the meeting point of the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]] mountain ranges, separated by the [[Bhavani River]].\n\nThe district comprises a long undulating plain, sloping gently towards the Kaveri River in the south-east. The three major tributaries of the Kaveri, the [[Bhavani River|Bhavani]], [[Noyyal]] and [[Amaravati River|Amaravati]], run across the long stretch of mountains in the north. In combination with these rivers, numerous canals, the [[Bhavanisagar Dam]] and the [[Kodiveri Dam]] provide irrigation and drainage for Erode.\n\n[[File:Bhavani-sagar-Dam-and-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|[[Bhavanisagar Dam]] across [[Bhavani River]]]]\n[[File:Cauvery at Erode.JPG|thumb|[[Kaveri River]] at [[Erode]]]]\n\n=== Bhavani River ===\n{{Main|Bhavani River}}\nThe Bhavani River rises in the [[Western Ghats]] of the [[Silent Valley National Park]] in the [[Palakkad District]] of [[Kerala]]. It is joined by the [[Siruvani River]], a perennial stream of [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore District]], and is joined by the [[Kundha River]] before entering Erode District in [[Sathyamangalam]]. The Bhavani is [[perennial river]], mostly fed by the southwest monsoon but also supplemented by the northeast monsoon. It runs for over one hundred miles through Erode District, crossing [[Bhavani taluk|Bhavani]] and [[Gobichettipalayam taluk|Gobichettipalayam]] taluks. Near [[Gobichettipalayam]] lies the [[Kodiveri Dam]], a mini-dam constructed for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe river eventually feeds the [[Bhavanisagar dam|Bhavanisagar reservoir]], and then takes an easterly course after crossing Sathyamangalam taluk. Along with another tributary, the Amutha Nathi River, the Bhavani River ultimately joins the [[Kaveri|Kaveri River]] in [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu]]. A confluence of three rivers, such as this one, is known as a ''[[Triveni Sangam]]'' in Hindu belief. The place where the Bhavani River joins with the Kaveri River is famous for the Sri Sangameshwara Temple of [[Lord Shiva]], where, in accordance to [[Hindu]] customs, people perform the last rites for deceased friends and family.\n\n=== Kaveri River ===\n{{Main|Kaveri River}}\nThe Kaveri River rises in the Western Ghats of [[Kodagu]] (Coorg) District in Karnataka, and is joined by many small tributaries. It runs eastward through Karnataka, and is joined by its main tributary, the [[Kabini River]], before taking a sharp southbound turn at [[Hogenakkal Falls]]. From here, it runs towards the southeast, forming the boundary between Bhavani taluk of Erode District and [[Tiruchengode]] taluk of the neighbouring [[Namakkal]] District. The Bhavani River joins the Kaveri River at the town of Bhavani.\n\n==Climate==\nUnlike nearby [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore District]], Erode District's climate is characterized by dry weather throughout the year, except during the monsoons, when it receives high rainfall. The cool, moist wind that passes through the [[Palghat Gap]] in the [[Western Ghats]] has a moderating effect on the climate of neighbouring Coimbatore district, but the air loses its coolness and becomes dry by the time it reaches Erode.\n\nGenerally, the first two months of the year are pleasant, but in March the temperature begins to rise, which persists until the end of May, when the highest temperatures are normally recorded. The few rain showers during this period do not provide much relief from the heat. However, the temperature reverses its rising trend during the pre-monsoon period, between June and August. By September, the monsoon rains begin to fall. The northeast monsoon sets in vigorously during October\u2013November. By December, the rains end, returning the climate to its dry and cold state.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Erode District Collector's Office.jpg|thumb|upright|Erode District Collector's Office]]\nFor administrative purposes, Erode District is divided into ten [[taluk]]s under two revenue divisions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NPR Report: Tamil Nadu: Erode|year=2011|publisher=National Population Register, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/NprStateReport.aspx?stcd=33&distcd=09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428071506/http://censusindia.gov.in/NprStateReport.aspx?stcd=33&distcd=09|archivedate=28 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* '''[[Erode division]]''' : [[Erode taluk]], [[Kodumudi taluk]], [[Modakurichi taluk]], [[Perundurai taluk]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Kodumudi, Modakurichi and Thalavadi taluks take off|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kodumudi-modakurichi-and-thalavadi-taluks-take-off/article8329438.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n* '''[[Gobichettipalayam division]]''' : [[Anthiyur taluk]], [[Bhavani taluk]], [[Gobichettipalayam taluk|Gobichettipalayam taluk]], [[Sathyamangalam taluk|Sathyamangalam taluk]], [[Nambiyur|Nambiyur taluk]], [[Thalavadi taluk]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Anthiyur becomes separate taluk in Erode district|date=22 November 2012|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anthiyur-becomes-separate-taluk-in-erode-district/article4125457.ece|accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nErode District consists of one [[Municipal corporations in India|municipal corporation]] and four other municipalities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/cma/municipalities/municipalities_gradewise.html |title=List of Municipalities |work=Government of Tamil Nadu |access-date=8 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202828/http://www.tn.gov.in/cma/municipalities/municipalities_gradewise.html |archivedate=28 September 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Erode Municipal Corporation]]\n* [[Gobichettipalayam Municipality|Gobichettipalayam Selection Grade Municipality]]\n* [[Sathyamangalam]] Grade-I municipality\n* [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu|Bhavani]] Grade-II municipality\n* [[Punjai Puliampatti]] Grade-II municipality\n\n==Politics==\nErode District is divided into 3 Parliamentary Constituencies of the [[Lok Sabha]]: [[Erode (Lok Sabha constituency)|Erode]], [[Nilgiris (Lok Sabha constituency)|Nilgiris]] and [[Tirupur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Tirupur]].

Smirnov''' and '''D. Smirnov-Sadovsky''', was a Russian-British composer.\n\n==Biography==\nSmirnov was born in [[Minsk]] into a family of opera singers Nikolay Senkin-Sadovsky and Eugenia Smirnova. He studied at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] 1967\u20131972 under [[Nikolai Sidelnikov]], [[Yuri Kholopov]] and [[Edison Denisov]]. He also studied privately with [[Philip Herschkowitz]], a pupil of both [[Alban Berg|Berg]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]]. He was married to the composer [[Elena Firsova]].  Their children are [[Philip Firsov]] (an artist and sculptor), and [[Alissa Firsova]] (a composer, pianist and conductor).\n\nHis ''Solo for Harp'' won First Prize in a competition in [[Maastricht]] (1976). His two operas  ''[[Tiriel (opera)|Tiriel]]'' and ''[[Thel (opera)|Thel]]'' on a text by [[William Blake]]  were premiered in 1989 (the first at the [[Freiburg]] Festival, Germany, and the second at the [[Almeida Theatre|Almeida]] Festival in London). The same year, his First Symphony (''The Seasons'') was performed at the [[Tanglewood]] Festival in the  United States. His orchestral ''Mozart-Variations'' were staged as a ballet in [[Pforzheim]] in Germany (1992). Other premieres include the oratorio ''A Song of Liberty'' ([[Leeds]], UK \u2013 1993), Cello Concerto ([[Manchester]], UK \u2013 1996), cantata ''Song of Songs'', ([[Geneva]], Switzerland \u2013 2001) Triple Concerto 2 ([[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]], [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London \u2013 2004). Many of Smirnov's works reflect his fascination with the poetry and art of [[William Blake]].\n\nIn 1979 he was blacklisted as one of the \"[[Khrennikov's Seven]]\" at the Sixth Congress of the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West. He was one of the founders of Russia's new ''[[ACM - Association for Contemporary Music]]'', established in Moscow in 1990. From 1991 Smirnov was resident of England. He was a ''Composer-in-Residence'' at [[University of Cambridge]] ([[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]), at [[Dartington]], and ''Visiting Professor'' at [[Keele University]] (1993\u20138). In 1998 Smirnov and his family settled in [[St Albans]]. From 2003 he taught at the [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].\n\nHis work has been performed by many notable conductors, including: [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Sir Andrew Davis]], [[Dennis Russell Davies]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Vassily Sinaisky]], [[Pavel Kogan (conductor)|Pavel Kogan]], [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and [[Yan Pascal Tortelier]]. Scores of selected works are available from various publishers including: [[Hans Sikorski]], Hamburg, [[Boosey & Hawkes]], London, and [[G. Schirmer]], New York City.\n\nSmirnov died on 9 April 2020 in [[Watford]], after contracting [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|url=https://www.classicalmusicnews.ru/news/dmitrij-smirnov-passed/|title=\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432|date=9 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020|publisher=ClassicalMusicNews.Ru|language=ru}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*Piano Sonata no.1 (1967), no.2 (1980), no.3 (1992), no.4 ''String of Destiny'' (2000), no.5 (2001), no.6 ''Blake-Sonata'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vivatmusic.com/catalogue/russian-emigres |title=Dmitri Smirnov (b.1948) Blake Sonata, Op. 157 (2008) recorded by Alissa Firsova to the CD VIVAT 109 ''Russian \u00c9migr\u00e9s''. |access-date=30 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801204453/http://www.vivatmusic.com/catalogue/russian-emigres |archive-date=1 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Violin Sonata no.1 (1969), no.2 (1979), no.3 (1998), no.4 (2005)\n*Piano Concerto no.1 (1971), no. 2 (1978)\n*''Eternal Refuge'' for voice and piano trio (also orchestra version) Text by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] (1972)\n*String Quartet no.1 (1974), no.2 (1985), no.3  (1993), no.4 (1993), no.5 (1994), no.6 (1998), no.7 (2005), no.8 ''Inferno'' (2007)\n*Clarinet Concerto (1974)\n*''Pastorale'' for orchestra (1975)\n*''Mirages'' for saxophone Quartet (1975)\n*Solo for harp (1976)\n*''The Sorrow of past Days'' for voice, flute, percussion, violin and cello.

His two operas  ''[[Tiriel (opera)|Tiriel]]'' and ''[[Thel (opera)|Thel]]'' on a text by [[William Blake]]  were premiered in 1989 (the first at the [[Freiburg]] Festival, Germany, and the second at the [[Almeida Theatre|Almeida]] Festival in London). The same year, his First Symphony (''The Seasons'') was performed at the [[Tanglewood]] Festival in the  United States. His orchestral ''Mozart-Variations'' were staged as a ballet in [[Pforzheim]] in Germany (1992). Other premieres include the oratorio ''A Song of Liberty'' ([[Leeds]], UK \u2013 1993), Cello Concerto ([[Manchester]], UK \u2013 1996), cantata ''Song of Songs'', ([[Geneva]], Switzerland \u2013 2001) Triple Concerto 2 ([[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]], [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London \u2013 2004). Many of Smirnov's works reflect his fascination with the poetry and art of [[William Blake]].\n\nIn 1979 he was blacklisted as one of the \"[[Khrennikov's Seven]]\" at the Sixth Congress of the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West. He was one of the founders of Russia's new ''[[ACM - Association for Contemporary Music]]'', established in Moscow in 1990. From 1991 Smirnov was resident of England. He was a ''Composer-in-Residence'' at [[University of Cambridge]] ([[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]), at [[Dartington]], and ''Visiting Professor'' at [[Keele University]] (1993\u20138). In 1998 Smirnov and his family settled in [[St Albans]]. From 2003 he taught at the [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].\n\nHis work has been performed by many notable conductors, including: [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Sir Andrew Davis]], [[Dennis Russell Davies]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Vassily Sinaisky]], [[Pavel Kogan (conductor)|Pavel Kogan]], [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and [[Yan Pascal Tortelier]]. Scores of selected works are available from various publishers including: [[Hans Sikorski]], Hamburg, [[Boosey & Hawkes]], London, and [[G. Schirmer]], New York City.\n\nSmirnov died on 9 April 2020 in [[Watford]], after contracting [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|url=https://www.classicalmusicnews.ru/news/dmitrij-smirnov-passed/|title=\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432|date=9 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020|publisher=ClassicalMusicNews.Ru|language=ru}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n*Piano Sonata no.1 (1967), no.2 (1980), no.3 (1992), no.4 ''String of Destiny'' (2000), no.5 (2001), no.6 ''Blake-Sonata'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vivatmusic.com/catalogue/russian-emigres |title=Dmitri Smirnov (b.1948) Blake Sonata, Op. 157 (2008) recorded by Alissa Firsova to the CD VIVAT 109 ''Russian \u00c9migr\u00e9s''. |access-date=30 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801204453/http://www.vivatmusic.com/catalogue/russian-emigres |archive-date=1 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Violin Sonata no.1 (1969), no.2 (1979), no.3 (1998), no.4 (2005)\n*Piano Concerto no.1 (1971), no. 2 (1978)\n*''Eternal Refuge'' for voice and piano trio (also orchestra version) Text by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] (1972)\n*String Quartet no.1 (1974), no.2 (1985), no.3  (1993), no.4 (1993), no.5 (1994), no.6 (1998), no.7 (2005), no.8 ''Inferno'' (2007)\n*Clarinet Concerto (1974)\n*''Pastorale'' for orchestra (1975)\n*''Mirages'' for saxophone Quartet (1975)\n*Solo for harp (1976)\n*''The Sorrow of past Days'' for voice, flute, percussion, violin and cello.

It is the northwestern and innermost extension of the [[Yellow Sea]], to which it communicates to the east via the [[Bohai Strait]].\n\nA medium-sized [[gulf]], the Bohai Sea is enclosed by four [[provinces of China|provinces]] from three different [[regions of China]] \u2014 [[Liaoning]] (of [[Northeast China]]), [[Hebei]] and the [[Tianjin]] [[direct-controlled municipalities of China|municipality]] (of [[North China]]) and [[Shandong]] (of [[East China]]), and considered part of the [[internal waters]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].  It is the center of the [[Bohai Economic Rim]], and its proximity to the Chinese capital [[Beijing]] makes it one of the busiest seaways in the world.\n\n==History==\nUntil the early 20th century, Bo Hai was often called the Gulf of Chihli ({{zh|s=\u76f4\u96b8\u6d77\u7063|p=Zh\u00edl\u00ec H\u01ceiw\u0101n|links=no}}) or the Gulf of Pechihli or Pechili ({{zh|s=\u5317\u76f4\u96b8\u6d77\u7063|p=B\u011bizh\u00edl\u00ec H\u01ceiw\u0101n|labels=no}}). [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] and [[Beizhili]] (North Zhili) were historic provinces in the area surrounding Beijing.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are three major bays inside the Bohai Gulf: [[Laizhou Bay]] to the south, [[Bohai Bay]] to the west, and [[Liaodong Bay]] to the north.  The [[provinces of China|provincial-level administrative divisions]] that have a coastline to the Bohai Sea are, from the south going clockwise: [[Shandong]], [[Hebei]], [[Tianjin]], Hebei again, and [[Liaoning]].\n\nSome of the major rivers draining into the gulf include the [[Yellow River]], [[Xiaoqing River]], [[Hai River]], [[Luan River]], [[Dai River (Hebei)|Dai River]], [[Daling River]], Xiaoling River, [[Liao River]] and [[Daliao River]].\n\nThere are a few important oil reserves in the vicinity of the gulf, including the [[Shengli Field]].  Important islands or island groups in the gulf include the [[Changshan Islands|Changshan Archipelago]] ({{zh|s=\u957f\u5c71\u5217\u5c9b|labels=no}}), Juehua Island ({{zh|s=\u89c9\u534e\u5c9b|labels=no}}), [[Bijia Mountain]] ({{zh|s=\u7b14\u67b6\u5c71|labels=no}}), [[Changxing Island (Dalian)|Changxing Island]] ({{zh|s=\u957f\u5174\u5c9b|labels=no}}), [[Xizhong Island]] ({{zh|s=\u897f\u4e2d\u5c9b|labels=no}}), the East/West Mayi Islands ({{zh|s=\u8682\u8681\u5c9b|labels=no}}), Zhu Island ({{zh|s=\u732a\u5c9b|labels=no}}) and She Island ({{zh|s=\u86c7\u5c9b|labels=no}}).\n\n=== Bohai Strait ===\nThe opening of the Bohai Gulf is bounded by the aforementioned Changshan Archipelago between [[Dalian]]'s [[L\u00fcshunkou District]] on the southern tip of [[Liaodong Peninsula]], and the [[cape (geography)|Cape]] of [[Penglai, Shandong|Penglai]] on the northernmost protrusion of [[Shandong Peninsula]].  Due to its proximity to the capital city Beijing and the population of its surrounding provinces exceeding 210 million, the exit of the Bohai Gulf to the [[Yellow Sea]], the '''Bohai Strait''' ({{zh|s=\u6e24\u6d77\u6d77\u5ce1|labels=no}}), has become one of busiest sea routes in recent times.  Due to the [[Changshan Islands|Changshan Island Chain]] traversing the southern half of the strait, the Bohai Strait is subdivided into several [[channel (geography)|channel]]s:\n\n(From north to south, the most commonly used ones in '''bold''')\n* '''Laotieshan Channel''' (\u8001\u94c1\u5c71\u6c34\u9053), also known as the Lau-ti-shan Channel, the widest and deepest \n* Daqin Channel (\u5927\u94a6\u6c34\u9053)\n* Xiaoqin Channel (\u5c0f\u94a6\u6c34\u9053)\n* North Tuoji Channel (\u5317\u7823\u77f6\u6c34\u9053)\n* South Tuoji Channel (\u5357\u7823\u77f6\u6c34\u9053)\n* '''Changshan Channel''' (\u957f\u5c71\u6c34\u9053), the most direct route to [[Tianjin]]\n* '''Dengzhou Channel''' (\u767b\u5dde\u6c34\u9053), also known as the '''Miaodao Channel''' (\u5e99\u5c9b\u6c34\u9053) or '''Miaodao Strait''' (\u5e99\u5c9b\u6d77\u5ce1), the nearest to shore but also the shallowest\n\n==Major ports==\nThere are five major ports along the Bohai Sea rim, with throughputs over 100 million tons, though the port of Tangshan is further subdivided into Jingtang and Caofeidian:[[File:Seaways Plan for the Bohai Sea.svg|thumb|right|450px|China MSA's Seaways Plan for the Bohai Sea.

The ports of [[Port of Dalian|Dalian]] and [[Port of Yantai|Yantai]] are also traditionally considered part of the Bohai rim, even though strictly speaking they lie outside the limits of the sea. The [[Port of Longkou]] reached 70 million tons of cargo in 2013, and is expected to reach the 100 million ton landmark in the near future.<ref>http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/12-23/5652663.shtml</ref>\n\n==Major cities along the Bohai Sea coast==\n[[File:Rocky shore in Dalian.jpg|thumb|Rocky shore in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]]]]\n* [[Liaoning province]]\n** [[Dalian]]\n** [[Yingkou]]\n** [[Panjin]]\n** [[Jinzhou]]\n** [[Huludao]]\n* [[Hebei province]]\n** [[Qinhuangdao]]\n** [[Tangshan]]\n** [[Cangzhou]]\n* [[Tianjin municipality]] \n* [[Shandong province]]\n** [[Yantai]]\n** [[Weifang]]\n** [[Dongying]]\n** [[Binzhou]]\n\n==Hydrocarbon resources==\nThe Bohai Bay contains significant oil and gas reserves, providing much of China's offshore production.

It is the northwestern and innermost extension of the [[Yellow Sea]], to which it communicates to the east via the [[Bohai Strait]].\n\nA medium-sized [[gulf]], the Bohai Sea is enclosed by four [[provinces of China|provinces]] from three different [[regions of China]] \u2014 [[Liaoning]] (of [[Northeast China]]), [[Hebei]] and the [[Tianjin]] [[direct-controlled municipalities of China|municipality]] (of [[North China]]) and [[Shandong]] (of [[East China]]), and considered part of the [[internal waters]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].  It is the center of the [[Bohai Economic Rim]], and its proximity to the Chinese capital [[Beijing]] makes it one of the busiest seaways in the world.\n\n==History==\nUntil the early 20th century, Bo Hai was often called the Gulf of Chihli ({{zh|s=\u76f4\u96b8\u6d77\u7063|p=Zh\u00edl\u00ec H\u01ceiw\u0101n|links=no}}) or the Gulf of Pechihli or Pechili ({{zh|s=\u5317\u76f4\u96b8\u6d77\u7063|p=B\u011bizh\u00edl\u00ec H\u01ceiw\u0101n|labels=no}}). [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] and [[Beizhili]] (North Zhili) were historic provinces in the area surrounding Beijing.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are three major bays inside the Bohai Gulf: [[Laizhou Bay]] to the south, [[Bohai Bay]] to the west, and [[Liaodong Bay]] to the north.  The [[provinces of China|provincial-level administrative divisions]] that have a coastline to the Bohai Sea are, from the south going clockwise: [[Shandong]], [[Hebei]], [[Tianjin]], Hebei again, and [[Liaoning]].\n\nSome of the major rivers draining into the gulf include the [[Yellow River]], [[Xiaoqing River]], [[Hai River]], [[Luan River]], [[Dai River (Hebei)|Dai River]], [[Daling River]], Xiaoling River, [[Liao River]] and [[Daliao River]].\n\nThere are a few important oil reserves in the vicinity of the gulf, including the [[Shengli Field]].  Important islands or island groups in the gulf include the [[Changshan Islands|Changshan Archipelago]] ({{zh|s=\u957f\u5c71\u5217\u5c9b|labels=no}}), Juehua Island ({{zh|s=\u89c9\u534e\u5c9b|labels=no}}), [[Bijia Mountain]] ({{zh|s=\u7b14\u67b6\u5c71|labels=no}}), [[Changxing Island (Dalian)|Changxing Island]] ({{zh|s=\u957f\u5174\u5c9b|labels=no}}), [[Xizhong Island]] ({{zh|s=\u897f\u4e2d\u5c9b|labels=no}}), the East/West Mayi Islands ({{zh|s=\u8682\u8681\u5c9b|labels=no}}), Zhu Island ({{zh|s=\u732a\u5c9b|labels=no}}) and She Island ({{zh|s=\u86c7\u5c9b|labels=no}}).\n\n=== Bohai Strait ===\nThe opening of the Bohai Gulf is bounded by the aforementioned Changshan Archipelago between [[Dalian]]'s [[L\u00fcshunkou District]] on the southern tip of [[Liaodong Peninsula]], and the [[cape (geography)|Cape]] of [[Penglai, Shandong|Penglai]] on the northernmost protrusion of [[Shandong Peninsula]].  Due to its proximity to the capital city Beijing and the population of its surrounding provinces exceeding 210 million, the exit of the Bohai Gulf to the [[Yellow Sea]], the '''Bohai Strait''' ({{zh|s=\u6e24\u6d77\u6d77\u5ce1|labels=no}}), has become one of busiest sea routes in recent times.  Due to the [[Changshan Islands|Changshan Island Chain]] traversing the southern half of the strait, the Bohai Strait is subdivided into several [[channel (geography)|channel]]s:\n\n(From north to south, the most commonly used ones in '''bold''')\n* '''Laotieshan Channel''' (\u8001\u94c1\u5c71\u6c34\u9053), also known as the Lau-ti-shan Channel, the widest and deepest \n* Daqin Channel (\u5927\u94a6\u6c34\u9053)\n* Xiaoqin Channel (\u5c0f\u94a6\u6c34\u9053)\n* North Tuoji Channel (\u5317\u7823\u77f6\u6c34\u9053)\n* South Tuoji Channel (\u5357\u7823\u77f6\u6c34\u9053)\n* '''Changshan Channel''' (\u957f\u5c71\u6c34\u9053), the most direct route to [[Tianjin]]\n* '''Dengzhou Channel''' (\u767b\u5dde\u6c34\u9053), also known as the '''Miaodao Channel''' (\u5e99\u5c9b\u6c34\u9053) or '''Miaodao Strait''' (\u5e99\u5c9b\u6d77\u5ce1), the nearest to shore but also the shallowest\n\n==Major ports==\nThere are five major ports along the Bohai Sea rim, with throughputs over 100 million tons, though the port of Tangshan is further subdivided into Jingtang and Caofedian:[[File:Seaways Plan for the Bohai Sea.svg|thumb|right|450px|China MSA's Seaways Plan for the Bohai Sea.

The ports of [[Port of Dalian|Dalian]] and [[Port of Yantai|Yantai]] are also traditionally considered part of the Bohai rim, even though strictly speaking they lie outside the limits of the sea. The [[Port of Longkou]] reached 70 million tons of cargo in 2013, and is expected to reach the 100 million ton landmark in the near future.<ref>http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/12-23/5652663.shtml</ref>\n\n==Major cities along the Bohai Sea coast==\n[[File:Rocky shore in Dalian.jpg|thumb|Rocky shore in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]]]]\n* [[Liaoning province]]\n** [[Dalian]]\n** [[Yingkou]]\n** [[Panjin]]\n** [[Jinzhou]]\n** [[Huludao]]\n* [[Hebei province]]\n** [[Qinhuangdao]]\n** [[Tangshan]]\n** [[Cangzhou]]\n* [[Tianjin municipality]] \n* [[Shandong province]]\n** [[Yantai]]\n** [[Weifang]]\n** [[Dongying]]\n** [[Binzhou]]\n\n==Hydrocarbon resources==\nThe Bohai Bay contains significant oil and gas reserves, providing much of China's offshore production.

The series chronicles the adventures of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Most characters are anthropomorphic sea creatures based on real-life species. Many of the characters' designs originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which Hillenburg created in 1989.\n\n''SpongeBob SquarePants'' features the voices of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Mr. Lawrence]], [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]] and [[Lori Alan]]. Most one-off and background characters are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Sirena Irwin]], [[Bob Joles]], [[Mark Fite]] and [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. In addition to the series' regular cast, various celebrities from a wide range of professions have voiced guest characters and recurring roles.\n\nThe show's characters have received positive critical reception and attention from celebrities. They have made frequent appearances in media outside of the television show, including a [[SpongeBob SquarePants (film series)|theatrical film series]] and many [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise#Games|video games]]. The characters have also been referenced and parodied throughout popular culture. The title character SpongeBob became a merchandising icon during the height of the show's second season and has seen continued commercial popularity.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nStephen Hillenburg originally conceived early versions of the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters in 1984, while he was teaching and studying [[marine biology]] at what is now the [[Ocean Institute|Orange County Marine Institute]] in [[Dana Point, California]].<ref name=\"Banks, pp. 8-9\" /> During this period, Hillenburg became fascinated with animation, and wrote a [[comic book]] titled ''The Intertidal Zone'' starring various [[anthropomorphic]] forms of sea creatures, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters,<ref name=\"Banks, p. 9\" /> including \"Bob the Sponge\", who was the co-host of the comic and resembled an actual [[sea sponge]] as opposed to SpongeBob.<ref name=\"Hillenburg\" /> In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue his dream of becoming an animator.<ref name=\"Banks, p. 9\"/><ref name=\"Hillenburg\" />\n\n[[File:Early sketches of SpongeBob SquarePants main characters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An early drawing of the initial main characters from Hillenburg's [[bible (screenwriting)|series bible]]]]\nPatrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the first other characters Hillenburg created for the show.<ref name=\"BoytoBob\">{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}</ref> Many of their characteristics were based on Hillenburg's experiences during his time at the Ocean Institute or inspired by the traits of their species.

In the series, Neptune lives in a palace in [[Atlantis]] with his wife [[Amphitrite]] and son [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. He is usually portrayed as arrogant and selfish, showing little sympathy for the sea's fish populace. Neptune has a mostly greenish-blue color scheme with a long reddish-brown beard and hair. He wears gold wrist bands and a matching crown decorated with a scallop ornament, plus a gold belt bearing a [[seahorse]] emblem. A different King Neptune is featured in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. In the film, he resides near Bikini Bottom with his daughter Mindy and resembles a light green-skinned king with a robe, a shorter beard and hair, a domed crown to cover his bald spot, and powers limited to what can be exercised through his trident.\n\n===Larry the Lobster===\n\nLarry the Lobster (usually voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]] for a line in \"MuscleBob BuffPants\") is a [[lobster]] bodybuilder and workout fanatic who lifts weights.<ref name=\"sidecharacters\"/> He is usually seen at Goo Lagoon alongside Scooter.

They are proud of SpongeBob but embarrassed that he still does not have a driver's license.\n\n===Grandma SquarePants===\n\nGrandma SquarePants (voiced by [[Marion Ross]]) is SpongeBob's paternal grandmother.

McTrout\" in ''Toonz2Nite'' commercials for [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons UK]].\n\n===Perch Perkins===\n\nPerch Perkins (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a [[yellow perch|perch]] who works as a famous field news reporter. While the Realistic Fish Head only reports on television news programs, Perch makes physical appearances reporting about events that occur.

They function as the series' background characters. They live in buildings made from metal ship funnels and use \"boatmobiles,\" amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation.

His appearance and job changed often throughout the first ten seasons. One of his critical appearances is in \"[[The Sponge Who Could Fly]]\" wherein he plays a farmer, a sailor, and finally, a [[human cannonball]]. At one time, he mistakes SpongeBob for a box of [[Bran Flakes]]. In season 11, the series' staff decided on a finite design for Old Man Jenkins,<ref>{{cite tweet|user=VincentWaller72|author=Vincent Waller|number=963478876541222912|date=17 July 2015|title=It was only because folks on our crew were having the same trouble distinguishing him from other old folk characters.

His first notable appearance is in  \"[[Pizza Delivery (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Pizza Delivery]]\", where he is to be the first customer to receive the Krusty Krab Pizza, which he refuses to accept and pay for because he didn't get his Diet Dr. Kelp drink (which he never ordered), leading to Squidward angrily slamming the pizza box into his face. He plays a heightened role in the episode \"[[Chocolate with Nuts]],\" in which he goes absolutely ballistic and chases SpongeBob and Patrick after they attempt to sell him chocolate bars at his doorstep, when he really just wanted to buy it all.\n\n===Jellyfish===\nThe jellyfish (vocal effects by [[Tom Kenny]]) are wild animals who reside in Jellyfish Fields, a meadow in Bikini Bottom, and have a strong affinity for music.

They are actually dancers rather than fighters and are rivals to Squidward's gang, a group of octopuses called the Pods.\n* '''Spot''' is Plankton's pet [[amoeba]], who lives in the Chum Bucket with him and Karen. Spot behaves similarly to a puppy, is a good retriever, and can grow very large when he needs to protect his owner. He first appears in the season 9 episode \"Plankton's Pet,\" and reappears in several episodes from season 11 onward.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Squilliam Fancyson III|Squilliam Fancyson}}''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is Squidward Tentacles' arrogant and wealthy arch-rival who has been able to succeed in everything Squidward has only dreamed of doing. He owns a four-story mansion with an expansive garden on the rooftop. He appears in six episodes throughout the first seven seasons. Alternate versions of him appear in \"Back to the Past\" and \"Code Yellow\", but he has not made a physical appearance since \"Keep Bikini Bottom Beautiful\".\n* The '''{{Visible anchor|Tattletale Strangler}}''' (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) is a criminal fish who appears in \"SpongeBob Meets the Strangler\". He is detained for repeatedly strangling someone and promises to strangle SpongeBob when the latter has him arrested. He escapes from jail and pretends to be a bodyguard to get close to SpongeBob, but SpongeBob's behavior annoys him to the point where he would rather be back in prison.\n* The '''Warden''' (voiced by [[R. Lee Ermey]]) is the head prison warden of the Inferno Island prison, appearing in \"The Inmates of Summer\". His demeanor is a stereotype of a drill sergeant: strict, demanding, and always speaking in a loud tone. This portrayal is reminiscent of Ermey's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|What Zit Tooya}}''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a middle-aged fish who appeared in \"Good Ol' Whatshisname\". He is the last customer whose name SpongeBob and Squidward need to learn as part of a contest held by Mr. Krabs. His name is a pun on \"What's it to ya?\", which causes confusion on Squidward's part.\n*'''{{visible anchor|The Yeti Crab|Yeti}}''' is a crab who Mr. Krabs imagines for a story in \"Yeti Krabs\". The creature ends up being real and visits the Krusty Krab.\n\n===Film characters===\n* '''{{visible anchor|Princess Mindy|Mindy}}''' (voiced by [[Scarlett Johansson]]) is King Neptune's daughter. She is Patrick's love interest. She is a motherly and friendly person and a very good friend of SpongeBob and Patrick. She always appears in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. She isn't mentioned in the TV series.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|Dennis}}''' (voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]]) is a hitman hired by Plankton to assassinate SpongeBob and Patrick before they are able to retrieve King Neptune's crown from Shell City. Before he manages to do that however he is first stomped by the Cyclops and  then hit by a pier. He only appeared in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''.\n* '''The Cyclops''' (voiced by [[Neil Ross]] and portrayed by Aaron Hendry) is a marine diver who is always seen wearing a diving suit and helmet, even when not underwater, and never talks but only grunts appearing only in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. He is actually a normal adult man; however, because humans tower virtually all sea life, Mindy describes him as \"the worst of all hazards\". He is the owner of \"Shell City\", which is really the name of a seaside gift and souvenir shop.\n* '''Burger-Beard the Pirate''' (portrayed by [[Antonio Banderas]]) is a pirate who, upon discovering a book capable of rewriting reality, steals the Krabby Patty formula to open up a fast food drive-in while also changing Bikini Bottom into a wasteland. He appears in ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''.\n* '''Kyle''' (voiced by [[Paul Tibbitt]] (US)/[[Joe Sugg]] (UK)/[[Robert Irwin (television personality)|Robert Irwin]] (Australia)) is an innocent seagull that listens to the stories of Burger-Beard. He appears in ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''.\n* '''Bubbles''' (voiced by [[Matt Berry]]/[[Jeff Bennett]]) is a god-like dolphin who is the overseer of the universe, watching them from a triangular building in outer space. SpongeBob and Plankton accidentally end up in his audience while using Karen's time machine in ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''.\n\n===Families and ancestors===\n* '''{{visible anchor|Blackjack SquarePants|Blackjack}}''' (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is SpongeBob's cousin who bullied him during their childhoods. In his lone appearance, Blackjack was imprisoned for littering but has since been released.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Stanley SquarePants|Stanley}}''' (voiced by [[Christopher Guest]]) is SpongeBob's cousin who appears solely in the episode \"Stanley S. SquarePants\". SpongeBob receives Stanley in a package sent by one of his uncles, who is relieved to have sent Stanley, since he would destroy anything he touches. True to this, despite SpongeBob trying to teach him, Stanley constantly destroys everything and almost makes SpongeBob lose his job.\n*'''Captain Blue SquarePants''' (voiced by Garnett Sailor) is SpongeBob's uncle who only appears in the episode \"BlackJack\". He is a retired police captain and lives right next to SpongeBob's cousin, BlackJack. In the episode, SpongeBob goes to his house to help him stop BlackJack from torturing SpongeBob's parents. However, he can't hear over the lawnmower and thinks SpongeBob wants to help him mow the lawn. It goes on like this for other noisy objects such as a [[blender]], a radio with static, and a [[phonograph]]. When he finally hears the news, he drives SpongeBob over to BlackJack's house, but he warns SpongeBob.\n* '''Herb''' and '''Margie Star''' are Patrick's parents. Their identities are temporarily taken by another starfish couple, Marty and Janet, in \"I'm with Stupid\". In \"Rule of Dumb\", it is revealed that Herb is a brother of Gary's father, Sluggo, making Patrick and Gary first cousins.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Mrs. Tentacles}}''' (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]) is Squidward's elderly mother. In earlier episodes, she only appears as hallucinations tormenting Squidward, but later appears in person in \"Krusty Towers\". She lives in a moai like Squidward, but with a curly hair-like structure on its roof and earring-like balls hanging from the sides.\n* '''\"Mama\" Krabs''' (voiced by [[Paul Tibbitt]]/[[Sirena Irwin]]) is Mr. Krabs' overbearing mother who still treats him slightly like a child. She is a friend of Old Man Jenkins. She first appears in \"[[Sailor Mouth]]\" and has been mostly retired from the show, aside from a cameo in \"Lame and Fortune.\" Although her name it's not officially mentioned in the series, she is referred to as \"Betsy\" in some merchandising.\n* '''Grandpa Redbeard''' (voiced by [[Dennis Quaid]]) is Mr. Krabs' paternal grandfather who is a pirate. In \"Grandpappy the Pirate\", he visits his grandson, thinking that the latter is also a pirate instead of the owner of a restaurant. Mr. Krabs tries not to disappoint Redbeard by disguising the Krusty Krab as a pirate ship, pretending Pearl is a sea monster, and dressing his employees as sailors.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|Primitive Sponge|Primitive Star}}''' and '''Primitive Star''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) are the earliest known ancestors of SpongeBob and Patrick, who appear in the episode \"SB-129\" when Squidward time-travels to the past. Upon seeing the two of them electrocuting themselves with a jellyfish, Squidward inadvertently teaches them the sport of Jellyfishing, which results in Squidward being documented as the inventor of Jellyfishing when he returns to the present. They also seem to strongly dislike Squidward's clarinet music, as they ruthlessly chase down Squidward upon hearing it. The scene where Primitive Sponge and Primitive Star are confronted by Squidward upon noticing them torturing themselves with the jellyfish, particularly, the pose struck by Primitive Sponge, has become an [[internet meme]], referred to as \"SpongeGar\" (which was actually the name given to another of SpongeBob's primitive ancestors in the episode \"Ugh\").\n* '''{{Visible anchor|SpongeGar|Patar|Squog|Primitive Gary|Primitive Krabs}}''', '''Patar''', and '''Squog''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], and [[Rodger Bumpass]]) are SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's neolithic ancestors who appear in \"Ugh.\" While still not being able to speak intelligibly, they are more advanced than the primitive ancestors in \"SB-129\" as they are shown to use stone tools and fire. Also appearing in the episode are '''Primitive Gary''' (voiced by Tom Kenny), Gary's gigantic ancestor and SpongeGar's pet, and '''Primitive Krabs''' (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]), Mr. Krabs' tiny ancestor who repeatedly chants \"money.\"\n* '''{{Visible anchor|SpongeTron|Patron}}''' and '''Patron''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) are SpongeBob and Patrick's robotic descendants who appear in \"SB-129\". SpongeTron has 486 clones, each one named after a letter of the English alphabet from 2,000 years in the future, while Patron has two heads.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|SpongeBuck SquarePants|Pecos Patrick|Hopalong Tentacles|William Krabs|Polene Puff|Dead Eye Plankton}}''', '''Pecos Patrick''', '''Hopalong Tentacles''', '''William Krabs''', '''Polene Puff''', and '''Dead Eye Plankton''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]], and [[Mr. Lawrence]]) are the main characters' wild west ancestors who appear in \"[[Pest of the West]]\". They lived in the town of Bikini Gulch and frequented an old-fashioned bar version of the Krusty Krab called the Krusty Kantina.\n* '''Squidly Tentacles''', '''King Krabs''', '''Princess Pearl''', '''Dark Knight''', '''Planktonamor''', and '''Karen the Crystal Ball''' (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Lori Alan]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mr. Lawrence]], and [[Jill Talley]]) are the medieval counterparts of the main characters who appear in \"[[Dunces and Dragons]]\". The present-day SpongeBob and Patrick are magically transported to their times and help save Princess Pearl from Planktonamor. Planktonamor additionally keeps a pet, the '''Dragon Jellyfish''', who is a giant jellyfish with a mane and a tail.\n\n==Reception==\n{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by SpongeBob SquarePants}}\nThe characters of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' have been well-received overall.

The series chronicles the adventures of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Most characters are anthropomorphic sea creatures based on real-life species. Many of the characters' designs originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which Hillenburg created in 1989.\n\n''SpongeBob SquarePants'' features the voices of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Mr. Lawrence]], [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]] and [[Lori Alan]]. Most one-off and background characters are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Sirena Irwin]], [[Bob Joles]], [[Mark Fite]] and [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. In addition to the series' regular cast, various celebrities from a wide range of professions have voiced guest characters and recurring roles.\n\nThe show's characters have received positive critical reception and attention from celebrities. They have made frequent appearances in media outside of the television show, including a [[SpongeBob SquarePants (film series)|theatrical film series]] and many [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise#Games|video games]]. The characters have also been referenced and parodied throughout popular culture. The title character SpongeBob became a merchandising icon during the height of the show's second season and has seen continued commercial popularity.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nStephen Hillenburg originally conceived early versions of the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters in 1984, while he was teaching and studying [[marine biology]] at what is now the [[Ocean Institute|Orange County Marine Institute]] in [[Dana Point, California]].<ref name=\"Banks, pp. 8-9\" /> During this period, Hillenburg became fascinated with animation, and wrote a [[comic book]] titled ''The Intertidal Zone'' starring various [[anthropomorphic]] forms of sea creatures, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters,<ref name=\"Banks, p. 9\" /> including \"Bob the Sponge\", who was the co-host of the comic and resembled an actual [[sea sponge]] as opposed to SpongeBob.<ref name=\"Hillenburg\" /> In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue his dream of becoming an animator.<ref name=\"Banks, p. 9\"/><ref name=\"Hillenburg\" />\n\n[[File:Early sketches of SpongeBob SquarePants main characters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An early drawing of the initial main characters from Hillenburg's [[bible (screenwriting)|series bible]]]]\nPatrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the first other characters Hillenburg created for the show.<ref name=\"BoytoBob\">{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}</ref> Many of their characteristics were based on Hillenburg's experiences during his time at the Ocean Institute or inspired by the traits of their species. Patrick's personality embodies the nature of the starfish; according to Hillenburg, they look \"dumb and slow\" but are \"very active and aggressive\" in reality, like Patrick.<ref name=\"Case\">Hillenburg, Stephen.

Mermaid Man is known for completely forgetting things and yelling a prolonged \"EVIL!\" whenever he hears the word, while Barnacle Boy seems to be the smarter, more sensible, and more irritable of the two. \"Mermaid Man Begins\" confirms that their given first names are Ernie and Tim (the first names of their respective voice actors) [[Aquaman]] artist [[Ramona Fradon]] drew the characters' comic book adventures.<ref>{{cite book|title= Superheroes!: Capes, cowls, and the creation of comic book culture|author1=Laurence Maslon|author2=Michael Kantor|page=167}}</ref> Since Borgnine's death in 2012, both characters have been limited to [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n===The Flying Dutchman===\n\nThe Flying Dutchman (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) is an irritable, mischievous pirate ghost who glows green.<ref name=\"sidecharacters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/spongebob-squarepants/games/spongebob-squarepants-which-spongebob-side-character-are-you/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217054306/http://www.nick.com/spongebob-squarepants/games/spongebob-squarepants-which-spongebob-side-character-are-you/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-17|title=Which ''SpongeBob'' Side Character Are You?|work=[[Nick.com]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]}}</ref> He is named after the ghost ship [[Flying Dutchman|of the same name]]. He haunts the seven seas because his unburied corpse was used as a window display. He collects souls as a [[Satan]]-like character and resides in a cavern containing [[Davy Jones' Locker]], a literal [[locker]] stuffed with smelly socks, which within the series is analogous to [[Hell]] and occasionally mentioned as a [[curse word]].\n\n===King Neptune===\n\nKing Neptune (voiced by [[John O'Hurley]]/[[Jeffrey Tambor]]) is a powerful, [[trident]]-wielding [[merman]] god who rules the sea, based on the [[Roman mythology|Roman mythological]] deity [[Neptune (mythology)|of the same name]]. In the series, Neptune lives in a palace in [[Atlantis]] with his wife [[Amphitrite]] and son [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. He is usually portrayed as arrogant and selfish, showing little sympathy for the sea's fish populace. Neptune has a mostly greenish-blue color scheme with a long reddish-brown beard and hair. He wears gold wrist bands and a matching crown decorated with a scallop ornament, plus a gold belt bearing a [[seahorse]] emblem. A different King Neptune is featured in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. In the film, he resides near Bikini Bottom with his daughter Mindy and resembles a light green-skinned king with a robe, a shorter beard and hair, a domed crown to cover his bald spot, and powers limited to what can be exercised through his trident.\n\n===Larry the Lobster===\n\nLarry the Lobster (usually voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]] for a line in \"MuscleBob BuffPants\") is a [[lobster]] bodybuilder and workout fanatic who lifts weights.<ref name=\"sidecharacters\"/> He is usually seen at Goo Lagoon alongside Scooter. He first appears in \"Ripped Pants\".\n\n===Harold and Margaret SquarePants===\n\nMr. Harold SquarePants (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) and Mrs. Margaret SquarePants (voiced by [[Sirena Irwin]]) are SpongeBob's parents, who more closely resemble round [[Sponge|sea sponges]] than SpongeBob.

They are proud of SpongeBob but embarrassed that he still does not have a driver's license.\n\n===Grandma SquarePants===\n\nGrandma SquarePants (voiced by [[Marion Ross]]) is SpongeBob's paternal grandmother. She has six children with her late husband, whose wisdom SpongeBob sometimes cites when he plans something.

He appears in the series' opening theme. He has been given various different names throughout the series and tie-in media; it is Mister Fish in ''SpongeBob's Nicktoon Summer Splash'', Elaine in \"[[The Great Patty Caper]]\", Johnny in ''[[Battle for Bikini Bottom]]'', and \"T. McTrout\" in ''Toonz2Nite'' commercials for [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons UK]].\n\n===Perch Perkins===\n\nPerch Perkins (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a [[yellow perch|perch]] who works as a famous field news reporter. While the Realistic Fish Head only reports on television news programs, Perch makes physical appearances reporting about events that occur. He is normally purple with a dark purple coat with a black wig and headphones, although some episodes and ''[[Nicktoons MLB]]'' show him with an orange color scheme and a red coat.\n\n===Bikini Bottomites===\n\nThe Bikini Bottomites are multicolored fish and other sea creatures who inhabit Bikini Bottom. They function as the series' background characters. They live in buildings made from metal ship funnels and use \"boatmobiles,\" amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Although the series uses a set sheet of about 150 designs for incidental characters,<ref>{{cite tweet|user=VincentWaller72|author=Vincent Waller|number=961681618078351360|date=8 February 2018|title=Part 3 of 3 Incidental Model Sheet for SpongeBob SquarePants}}</ref> the Bikini Bottomites' voices and characterizations vary throughout their appearances.

He makes his first appearance in \"Reef Blower\", but his recurring line is not heard until \"Boating School\". Fred appears as a major character in the season 11 episode \"My Leg!\" where it is revealed that he hurts his leg on purpose because he is in love with a nurse at the hospital.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Harold}}''' (voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]]/[[Dee Bradley Baker]]/[[Clancy Brown]]) is a blue fish with a shark-like fin and spiked teeth. His character model is often used as an angry or troublemaking townsperson. His name is revealed in both \"Have You Seen This Snail?\" and in \"Roller Cowards\".

Wilson]]/[[Mr. Lawrence]]) are a pair of police officer fish in Bikini Bottom.

His appearance and job changed often throughout the first ten seasons. One of his critical appearances is in \"[[The Sponge Who Could Fly]]\" wherein he plays a farmer, a sailor, and finally, a [[human cannonball]]. At one time, he mistakes SpongeBob for a box of [[Bran Flakes]]. In season 11, the series' staff decided on a finite design for Old Man Jenkins,<ref>{{cite tweet|user=VincentWaller72|author=Vincent Waller|number=963478876541222912|date=17 July 2015|title=It was only because folks on our crew were having the same trouble distinguishing him from other old folk characters. This problem is now solved.}}</ref> and the actor John Gegenhuber began to consistently voice him.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Old Man Walker}}''' (voiced by Tom Kenny) is an elderly fish who is often seen at the Krusty Krab. He was originally one of the many designs of Old Man Jenkins before the skinny green design of the character became the definite version of the character - since then, the production crew had referred to this former version of Old Man Jenkins as \"Old Man Walker\".

His first notable appearance is in  \"[[Pizza Delivery (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Pizza Delivery]]\", where he is to be the first customer to receive the Krusty Krab Pizza, which he refuses to accept and pay for because he didn't get his Diet Dr. Kelp drink (which he never ordered), leading to Squidward angrily slamming the pizza box into his face. He plays a heightened role in the episode \"[[Chocolate with Nuts]],\" in which he goes absolutely ballistic and chases SpongeBob and Patrick after they attempt to sell him chocolate bars at his doorstep, when he really just wanted to buy it all.\n\n===Jellyfish===\nThe jellyfish (vocal effects by [[Tom Kenny]]) are wild animals who reside in Jellyfish Fields, a meadow in Bikini Bottom, and have a strong affinity for music. Within the series, jellyfish behave like sentient insects, squirt jelly, buzz and swarm like bees, and can sting their enemies with electric shocks that leave painful welts.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n* '''Angry Jack''' (voiced by [[Dee Snider]]) is the owner of a snail shell emporium in \"Shell Shocked\". He initially pretends to have an angry demeanor as a marketing stint for his store's commercials, but becomes truly infuriated when SpongeBob accidentally destroys every shell in his emporium.\n* '''Bubble Buddy''' (voiced by Brad Abrell) is a humanoid bubble created by SpongeBob in \"Bubble Buddy\". His apparent inanimateness annoys other people of Bikini Bottom, but he is later revealed to be a sentient being before moving out of the town in a taxi-shaped bubble.\n* '''Craig Mammalton''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a sea lion who is popular among Goo Lagoon beachgoers for his tanned skin and golden caramel brown bones.

Wilson]]) is a green [[flounder]] who had several silent cameos in various ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 1)]]'' episodes before appearing as the new student at Mrs. Puff's Boating School in \"The Bully\". He wants to kick SpongeBob's \"butt\" for no apparent reason and SpongeBob takes it as if Flats wants to murder him.\n* '''Gene Scallop''' (voiced by [[Gene Shalit]]) is a food critic who critiques the Krusty Krab in \"The Krusty Sponge.\" He negatively reviews every aspect of the restaurant except for SpongeBob. In response to Scallop's review, Mr. Krabs exploits SpongeBob's newfound popularity by theming the Krusty Krab around SpongeBob. He is modeled after his voice actor, a real-life book and film critic.\n* '''Gordon''' (voiced by [[Ian McShane]]) is the leader of a band of Vikings who kidnap SpongeBob and Squidward in \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 6)#ep14a|Dear Vikings]].\" Except for himself, all of his crewmen are named \"Olaf\".\n* '''Granny''' (voiced by [[Amy Poehler]]) is an elderly fish who appears in \"[[Have You Seen This Snail?]].

Lee Ermey]]) is the head prison warden of the Inferno Island prison, appearing in \"The Inmates of Summer\".

He is actually a normal adult man; however, because humans tower virtually all sea life, Mindy describes him as \"the worst of all hazards\". He is the owner of \"Shell City\", which is really the name of a seaside gift and souvenir shop.\n* '''Burger-Beard the Pirate''' (portrayed by [[Antonio Banderas]]) is a pirate who, upon discovering a book capable of rewriting reality, steals the Krabby Patty formula to open up a fast food drive-in while also changing Bikini Bottom into a wasteland.

SquarePants\". SpongeBob receives Stanley in a package sent by one of his uncles, who is relieved to have sent Stanley, since he would destroy anything he touches. True to this, despite SpongeBob trying to teach him, Stanley constantly destroys everything and almost makes SpongeBob lose his job.\n*'''Captain Blue SquarePants''' (voiced by Garnett Sailor) is SpongeBob's uncle who only appears in the episode \"BlackJack\". He is a retired police captain and lives right next to SpongeBob's cousin, BlackJack. In the episode, SpongeBob goes to his house to help him stop BlackJack from torturing SpongeBob's parents. However, he can't hear over the lawnmower and thinks SpongeBob wants to help him mow the lawn. It goes on like this for other noisy objects such as a [[blender]], a radio with static, and a [[phonograph]]. When he finally hears the news, he drives SpongeBob over to BlackJack's house, but he warns SpongeBob.\n* '''Herb''' and '''Margie Star''' are Patrick's parents.

In \"Grandpappy the Pirate\", he visits his grandson, thinking that the latter is also a pirate instead of the owner of a restaurant. Mr. Krabs tries not to disappoint Redbeard by disguising the Krusty Krab as a pirate ship, pretending Pearl is a sea monster, and dressing his employees as sailors.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|Primitive Sponge|Primitive Star}}''' and '''Primitive Star''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) are the earliest known ancestors of SpongeBob and Patrick, who appear in the episode \"SB-129\" when Squidward time-travels to the past. Upon seeing the two of them electrocuting themselves with a jellyfish, Squidward inadvertently teaches them the sport of Jellyfishing, which results in Squidward being documented as the inventor of Jellyfishing when he returns to the present. They also seem to strongly dislike Squidward's clarinet music, as they ruthlessly chase down Squidward upon hearing it. The scene where Primitive Sponge and Primitive Star are confronted by Squidward upon noticing them torturing themselves with the jellyfish, particularly, the pose struck by Primitive Sponge, has become an [[internet meme]], referred to as \"SpongeGar\" (which was actually the name given to another of SpongeBob's primitive ancestors in the episode \"Ugh\").\n* '''{{Visible anchor|SpongeGar|Patar|Squog|Primitive Gary|Primitive Krabs}}''', '''Patar''', and '''Squog''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], and [[Rodger Bumpass]]) are SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's neolithic ancestors who appear in \"Ugh.\" While still not being able to speak intelligibly, they are more advanced than the primitive ancestors in \"SB-129\" as they are shown to use stone tools and fire.
