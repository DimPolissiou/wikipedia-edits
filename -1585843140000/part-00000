She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring a professional curator, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. The following year she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].     \n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943. The agricultural school she organized is now known as the Lubny Forestry College.\n\n==Early life==\nKateryna Nikolaevna von Reiser, known as Katya, was born 19 February 1852 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]{{#tag:ref|Though other sources give other years for von Reiser's birth,{{sfn|\u0406\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|2016|p=27}} Astryab states Katya was 7 years old when her father died, i.e. born 1852.

S.) \u2013 summer 1932) was a [[Ukrainian nobility|Ukrainian noblewoman]], philanthropist, and collector of folklore. She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring a professional curator, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. The following year she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].     \n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943. The agricultural school she organized is now known as the Lubny Forestry College.\n\n==Early life==\nKateryna Nikolaevna von Reiser, known as Katya, was born 19 February 1852 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]{{#tag:ref|Though other sources give other years for von Reiser's birth,{{sfn|\u0406\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|2016|p=27}} Astryab states Katya was 7 years old when her father died, i.e. born 1852.

The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to reduce the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing shortages of water.\n\nWater resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,\u00ac000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.\n\n[[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Water availability in Yemen]] has decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |title=The Water Crisis in Yemen: Causes, Consequences and Solutions |author=Nicole Glass |journal=Global Majority e-Journal |volume=1 |date=June 2010 |pages=17\u201330 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206093845/https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2016  }}</ref> Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen.

Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the country's resources. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.<ref name=\"Rageh\">{{Cite

The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to reduce the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing shortages of water.\n\nWater resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,\u00ac000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.\n\n[[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Water availability in Yemen]] has decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |title=The Water Crisis in Yemen: Causes, Consequences and Solutions |author=Nicole Glass |journal=Global Majority e-Journal |volume=1 |date=June 2010 |pages=17\u201330 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206093845/https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2016  }}</ref> Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen.

Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the country's resources. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.<ref name=\"Rageh\">{{Cite

Boortz touched on many controversial topics.\n\nBoortz's first involvement with radio was in the 1960s, while he was a student at [[Texas A&M University]], working as a local on-air personality at [[WTAW (AM)|WTAW]]. After moving to Georgia, he became an avid listener of Atlanta's first talk radio station. Boortz became a regular caller to the morning talk show. When the show's host died, it created a job opening, which Boortz actively pursued. He was initially hired on a two-week \"trial run\", and later offered the permanent position. Boortz attended night law school, earning a law degree in 1977. For some years he worked as both an attorney and as a talk show host. He eventually closed his law practice to concentrate on his work in radio.\n\nBoortz has received many industry accolades. He was named as one of the \"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\" by ''Talkers'' magazine, and one of \"Georgia's 100 Most Influential People\" by ''Georgia Trend''.

For two years he worked at [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's Department Store]], where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of [[AM 680]] WRNG (now [[WCNN]]).  The station called itself \"Ring Radio,\" as in the ring of a telephone.  It was Atlanta's first [[talk radio]] station.  Boortz listened to morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a [[Fan (person)|devotee]]. \"Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled.\"<ref name=\"devotee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/1998/07/01|title=Neal Boortz-Have Mouth Will Talk|publisher=Atlanta Magazine|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=October 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223020930/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/1998/07/01|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that \"they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place,\" Boortz was offered the role of temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening time slot. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years.<ref name=\"PMSB\" /> Boortz honed his skills at the [[List of North American broadcast station classes#AM|tiny 1,000-watt station]], and even wrote a few speeches for then [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Lester Maddox]]. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG \"[[Termination of employment|dumped him]].\" He worked briefly at radio station [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], but soon returned to Atlanta.<ref name=\"devotee\" />\n\nIn 1974, Boortz enrolled in then-unaccredited [[John Marshall Law School (Atlanta)]] going to class in his spare time, while he and his wife Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing \"the money to keep me in law school.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993.<ref name=\"faq\"/> During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer [[Evander Holyfield]]. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed [[Subaru]] [[car dealership]] investment. Boortz told [[Atlanta (magazine)|Atlanta Magazine]] \"It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between [[Atlanta mayor]] [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]] and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: ''Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander . ... ''<ref name=\"devotee\" /> Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an \"unethical [[son of a bitch]].\" Boortz later remarked \"It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.\n\n=== Full Time Radio Career ===\nWhile in law school, Boortz returned to work at WRNG. In 1983 he moved to the larger news-talk radio station [[WGST]]. He later recounted how he would often go into work at his law office at 5 a.m., work there for several hours, then go to WGST, and finally back to the law office until 11:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"devotee\" /> In 1992, Boortz asked WGST for a raise; a salary equal to his combined income as an attorney and a radio host. When WGST refused, Boortz left. He got his raise when he signed an exclusive contract with [[AM 750]] [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] to host a weekday radio show. Shortly after that, he closed his law office. In 1995, [[Talkers Magazine]] named Boortz one of the \"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\".

Boortz touched on many controversial topics.\n\nBoortz's first involvement with radio was in the 1960s, while he was a student at [[Texas A&M University]], working as a local on-air personality at [[WTAW (AM)|WTAW]]. After moving to Georgia, he became an avid listener of Atlanta's first talk radio station. Boortz became a regular caller to the morning talk show. When the show's host died, it created a job opening, which Boortz actively pursued. He was initially hired on a two-week \"trial run\", and later offered the permanent position. Boortz attended night law school, earning a law degree in 1977. For some years he worked as both an attorney and as a talk show host. He eventually closed his law practice to concentrate on his work in radio.\n\nBoortz has received many industry accolades. He was named as one of the \"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\" by ''Talkers'' magazine, and one of \"Georgia's 100 Most Influential People\" by ''Georgia Trend''.

For two years he worked at [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's Department Store]], where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of [[AM 680]] WRNG (now [[WCNN]]).  The station called itself \"Ring Radio,\" as in the ring of a telephone.  It was Atlanta's first [[talk radio]] station.  Boortz listened to morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a [[Fan (person)|devotee]]. \"Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled.\"<ref name=\"devotee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/1998/07/01|title=Neal Boortz-Have Mouth Will Talk|publisher=Atlanta Magazine|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=October 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223020930/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/1998/07/01|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that \"they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place,\" Boortz was offered the role of temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening time slot. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years.<ref name=\"PMSB\" /> Boortz honed his skills at the [[List of North American broadcast station classes#AM|tiny 1,000-watt station]], and even wrote a few speeches for then [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Lester Maddox]]. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG \"[[Termination of employment|dumped him]].\" He worked briefly at radio station [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], but soon returned to Atlanta.<ref name=\"devotee\" />\n\nIn 1974, Boortz enrolled in then-unaccredited [[John Marshall Law School (Atlanta)]] going to class in his spare time, while he and his wife Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing \"the money to keep me in law school.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993.<ref name=\"faq\"/> During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer [[Evander Holyfield]]. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed [[Subaru]] [[car dealership]] investment. Boortz told [[Atlanta (magazine)|Atlanta Magazine]] \"It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between [[Atlanta mayor]] [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]] and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: ''Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander . ... ''<ref name=\"devotee\" /> Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an \"unethical [[son of a bitch]].\" Boortz later remarked \"It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control.\"<ref name=\"devotee\" /> In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.\n\n=== Full Time Radio Career ===\nWhile in law school, Boortz returned to work at WRNG. In 1983 he moved to the larger news-talk radio station [[WGST]]. He later recounted how he would often go into work at his law office at 5 a.m., work there for several hours, then go to WGST, and finally back to the law office until 11:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"devotee\" /> In 1992, Boortz asked WGST for a raise; a salary equal to his combined income as an attorney and a radio host. When WGST refused, Boortz left. He got his raise when he signed an exclusive contract with [[AM 750]] [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] to host a weekday radio show. Shortly after that, he closed his law office. In 1995, [[Talkers Magazine]] named Boortz one of the \"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\".
