{"title_page": "Inverse problem", "text_new": "{{For|the use in [[geodesy]]|Inverse geodetic problem}}\n\nAn '''inverse problem''' in science is the process of calculating from a set of observations the [[causal]] factors that produced them: for example, calculating an image in [[X-ray computed tomography]], source reconstruction in acoustics, or calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of its [[gravity field]]. It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.\n\nInverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in [[system identification]], [[optics]], [[radar]], [[acoustics]], [[communication theory]], [[signal processing]], [[medical imaging]], [[computer vision]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[astronomy]], [[remote sensing]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine learning]], [[nondestructive testing]], and many other fields.\n\n==History==\nStarting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries. A historical example is the calculations of [[John Couch Adams|Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]] which led to the discovery of [[Neptune]] from the perturbed trajectory of [[Uranus]]. However, a formal study of inverse problems was not initiated until the 20th century.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a solution to an inverse problem was discovered by [[Hermann Weyl]] and published in 1911, describing the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |title=\u00dcber die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte |journal=Nachrichten der K\u00f6niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen |pages=110\u2013117 |year=1911 |access-date=2018-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801090504/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today known as ''[[Weyl's law]]'', it is perhaps most easily understood as an answer to the question of whether it is possible to [[Hearing the shape of a drum|hear the shape of a drum]]. Weyl conjectured that the eigenfrequencies of a drum would be related to the area and perimeter of the drum by a particular equation, a result improved upon by later mathematicians.\n\nThe field of inverse problems was later touched on by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] physicist, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]].<ref>[http://ambartsumian.ru/en/papers/epilogue-ambartsumian\u2019-s-paper/ \u00bb Epilogue \u2014 Ambartsumian\u2019 s paper Viktor Ambartsumian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A life in astrophysics.

He then asked: given a family of eigenvalues, is it possible to find the form of the equations whose eigenvalues they are? Essentially Ambartsumian was examining the inverse [[Sturm\u2013Liouville problem]], which dealt with determining the equations of a vibrating string. This paper was published in 1929 in the German physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' and remained in obscurity for a rather long time. Describing this situation after many decades, Ambartsumian said, \"If an astronomer publishes an article with a mathematical content in a physics journal, then the most likely thing that will happen to it is oblivion.\"\n\nNonetheless, toward the end of the Second World War, this article, written by the 20-year-old Ambartsumian, was found by Swedish mathematicians and formed the starting point for a whole area of research on inverse problems, becoming the foundation of an entire discipline.\n\nThen important efforts have been devoted to a \"direct solution\" of the inverse scattering problem especially by [[Marchenko equation|Gelfand and Levitan]] in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Burridge |first1=Robert |title=The Gelfand-Levitan, the Marchenko, and the Gopinath-Sondhi integral equations of inverse scattering theory, regarded in the context of inverse impulse-response problems |journal=Wave Motion |date=1980 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013323 |doi=10.1016/0165-2125(80)90011-6 }}</ref> They proposed an analytic constructive method for determining the solution.  When computers became available, some authors have investigated the possibility of applying their approach to similar problems such as the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation. But it rapidly turned out that the inversion is an unstable process : noise and errors can be tremendously amplified making a direct solution hardly practicable.\nThen, around the seventies, the least-squares and probabilistic approaches came in and turned out to be very helpful for the determination of parameters involved in various physical systems. This approach met a lot of success. Nowadays inverse problems are also investigated in fields outside physics, such as chemistry, economy, and computer science. Eventually, as numerical models invade the whole society, we may expect an inverse problem associated with each of these numerical models.\n\n==Conceptual understanding==\nSince Newton, scientists have extensively attempted to model the world. In particular, when a [[mathematical model]] is available (for instance, Newton's gravitational law or Coulomb's equation for electrostatics), we can foresee, given some parameters that describe a physical system (such as a distribution of mass or a distribution of electric charges), the behavior of the system. This approach is known as mathematical modeling and the above-mentioned physical parameters are called the '''model parameters''' or simply the '''model'''. To be precise, we introduce the notion of '''state of the physical system''': it is the solution of the mathematical model's equation. In [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], these equations are referred to as the [[State-space representation|state equations]]. In many situations we are not truly interested in knowing the physical state but just its effects on some objects (for instance, the effects the gravitational field on a specific planet). Hence we have to introduce another operator, called the '''observation operator''', which converts the state of the physical system (here the predicted gravitational field) into what we want to observe (here the movements of the considered planet). We can now introduce the so-called '''forward problem''', which consists of two steps:\n* determination of the state of the system from the physical parameters that describe it\n* application of the observation operator to estimated state of the system so as to predict the behavior of what we want to observe.\nThis leads to introduce another [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] <math>F</math> ('''''F''''' stands for \"forward\") which maps model parameters <math>p</math> into <math>F(p)</math>, the data that model <math>p</math> predicts that is the result of this two-step procedure. Operator <math>F</math> is called '''forward operator''' or '''forward map'''.\nIn this approach we basically attempt at predicting the effects knowing the causes.\n\nThe table below shows, the Earth being considered as the physical system and for different physical phenomena, the model parameters that describe the system, the physical quantity that describes the state of the physical system and observations commonly made on the state of the system. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Governing equations !! Model parameters !! State of the physical system !! Common observations on the system\n|-\n| [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravity]] || Distribution of mass || [[Gravitational field]] || Measurement made by [[gravimeter]]s at different surface locations\n|-\n| [[Maxwell's equations]] || Distribution of [[magnetic susceptibility]] || [[Magnetic field]] ||Magnetic field measured at different surface locations by [[magnetometer]]s (case of a steady state) ||\n|-\n| [[Wave equation]] || Distribution of wave-speeds and densities || Wave-field caused by artificial or natural [[seismic source]]s || [[Particle velocity]] measured by seismometers placed at different surface locations\n|-\n| [[Diffusion equation]] || Distribution of [[Mass diffusivity|Diffusion coefficient]] || Diffusing material concentration as a function of space and time || Monitoring of this concentration measured at different locations\n|}\nIn the inverse problem approach we, roughly speaking, try to know the causes given the effects.\n\n==General statement of the inverse problem==\nThe inverse problem is the \"inverse\" of the forward problem : we want to determine the model parameters that produce the data <math>d_{obs}</math> that is the observation we have recorded (the subscript '''''obs ''''' stands for observed).\nSo that we look for the model parameters <math>p</math> such that (at least approximately)\n:<math>\\ d_{obs} = F(p)</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the forward map. We denote by <math>M</math> the number (possibly infinite) of model parameters, and by <math>N</math> the number of recorded data.\nWe introduce some useful concepts and the associated notations that will be used in the sequel :\n* The '''space of models''' denoted by <math>P</math> : the [[vector space]] spanned by model parameters; it has <math>M</math> dimensions;\n* The '''space of data''' denoted by <math>D</math> : <math>D=\\mathbb{R}^N</math> if we organize the measured samples in a vector with <math>N</math> components (if our measurements consist of functions, <math>D</math> is a vector space with infinite dimensions);\n* <math>F(p)</math> : the '''response of model'''   <math>p</math>; it consists of the '''data predicted by model''' <math>p</math>;\n* <math>F(P)</math> : the image of <math>P</math> by the forward map, it is a subset of <math>D</math> (but not a subspace unless <math>F</math> is linear) made of responses of all models;\n* <math>d_{obs}-F(p)</math> : the '''data misfits (or residuals)''' associated with model  <math>p</math> : they can be arranged as a vector, an element of <math>D</math>.\nThe concept of residuals is very important : in the scope of finding a model that matches the data, '''their analysis reveals if the considered model can be considered as realistic or not'''. Systematic unrealistic discrepancies between the data and the model responses also reveals that the forward map is inadequate and may give insights about an improved forward map.\n\nWhen operator <math>F</math> is linear, the inverse problem is linear. Otherwise, that is most often, the inverse problem is nonlinear.\nAlso, models cannot always be described by a finite number of parameters. It is the case when we look for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed parameters]] (a distribution of wave-speeds for instance): in such cases the goal of the inverse problem is to retrieve one or several functions. Such inverse problems are inverse problems with infinite dimension.\n\n==<span id=\"Linear inverse problem\"></span>Linear inverse problems==\nIn the case of a linear forward map and when we deal with a finite number of model parameters, the forward map can be written as a [[linear system]]\n:<math>\\ d = Fp</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that characterizes the forward map.\n\n===An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field===\nOnly a few physical systems are actually linear with respect to the model parameters. One such system from geophysics is that of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]. The Earth's gravitational field is determined by the density distribution of the Earth in the subsurface. Because the [[lithology]] of the Earth changes quite significantly, we are able to observe minute differences in the Earth's gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. From our understanding of gravity (Newton's Law of Gravitation), we know that the mathematical expression for gravity is:\n:<math>d= \\frac{G p}{r^2};</math>\nhere <math>d</math> is a measure of the local gravitational acceleration, <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational acceleration|universal gravitational constant]], <math>p</math> is the local mass (which is related to density) of the rock in the subsurface and <math>r</math> is the distance from the mass to the observation point.\n\nBy discretizing the above expression, we are able to relate the discrete data observations on the surface of the Earth to the discrete model parameters (density) in the subsurface that we wish to know more about. For example, consider the case where we have measurements carried out at 5 locations on the surface of the Earth. In this case, our data vector, <math>d</math> is a column vector of dimension (5x1): its <math>i</math>th component is associated with the <math>i</math>th observation location.  We also know that we only have five unknown masses <math>p_j</math> in the subsurface (unrealistic but used to demonstrate the concept) with known location : we denote by <math>r_{ij}</math> the distance between the <math>i</math>th observation location and the <math>j</math>th mass. Thus, we can construct the linear system relating the five unknown masses to the five data points as follows:\n:<math>d = F p, \\,</math>\n:<math>d =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nd_1 \\\\\nd_2 \\\\\nd_3 \\\\\nd_4 \\\\\nd_5 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>p =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_1 \\\\\np_2 \\\\\np_3 \\\\\np_4 \\\\\np_5\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>F =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{G}{r_{11}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{12}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{13}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{14}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{15}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{21}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{22}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{23}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{24}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{25}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{31}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{32}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{33}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{34}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{35}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{41}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{42}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{43}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{44}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{45}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{51}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{52}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{53}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{54}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{55}^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nTo solve for the model parameters that fit our data, we might be able to invert the matrix <math>F</math> to directly convert the measurements into our model parameters. For example:\n:<math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math>\nA system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation : our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix <math>F</math> is not square.\n\nHowever, even a square matrix can have no inverse : matrix <math>F</math> can be [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.\nAlso noise may corrupt our observations making <math>d</math> possibly outside the space <math>F(P)</math> of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> may not exist. This is another difficulty.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the first difficulty ====\nThe first difficulty reflects a crucial problem: Our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical '''prior information''' on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence. It can also come from other experiments: For instance, we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. \nThe integration of this additional information is basically a problem of [[statistics]]. This discipline is the one that can answer the question: How to mix quantities of different nature? We will be more precise in the section \"Bayesian approach\" below.\n\nConcerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists of information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the \"simplest\" model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by [[Penalty method|penalizing]] the [[Lp space|<math>L^1</math> norm]] of the gradient (or the [[total variation]]) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces freedom degrees only when necessary.\n\nAdditional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case, the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a '''subset of admissible models''' denoted by <math>P_{adm}</math> in the sequel.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the second difficulty ====\nAs mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for [[model selection|the best (or optimal) model]]: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an [[objective function]], namely a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]  that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, <math>\\varphi</math>, is of the form:\n:<math>\\varphi(p) = \\|F p-d_{obs} \\|^2 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\| \\| \\,</math> is the Euclidean norm (it will be the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math> norm]] when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of [[Least squares|ordinary least squares]], an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers: to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the <math>L^1</math> norm, in replacement of the <math>L^2</math> norm.\n\n==== Bayesian approach ====\nVery similar to the least-squares approach is the probabilistic approach: If we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, which is the model that matches the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood criterion]]. If the noise is [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the [[Covariance|co-variance]] of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using [[Bayesian inference]] to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola's book.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantola |first1=Albert |title=Inverse problem theory |url=https://archive.org/details/inverseproblemth0000tara |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780444599674 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of our elementary example ====\nHere we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model <math>p_{opt}</math>, this gradient vanishes which can be written as :\n:<math>\\nabla_p \\varphi = 2(F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} - F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs}) = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere ''F''<sup>T</sup> denotes the [[matrix transpose]] of ''F''. This equation simplifies to:\n:<math>F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} = F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs} \\,</math>\n\nThis expression is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Normal_equations&redirect=no normal equation] and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. \nIn our example matrix <math>F^\\mathrm{T} F</math> turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters : we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution.\n\n=== Mathematical and computational aspects ===\n\nInverse problems are typically ill posed, as opposed to the [[well-posed problem]]s usually met in mathematical modeling. Of the three conditions for a [[well-posed problem]] suggested by [[Jacques Hadamard]] (existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution or solutions) the condition of stability is most often violated. In the sense of [[functional analysis]], the inverse problem is represented by a mapping between [[metric space]]s. While inverse problems are often formulated in infinite dimensional spaces, limitations to a finite number of measurements, and the practical consideration of recovering only a finite number of unknown parameters, may lead to the problems being recast in discrete form. In this case the inverse problem will typically be ''[[condition number|ill-conditioned]]''. In these cases, [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] may be used to introduce mild assumptions on the solution and prevent [[overfitting]]. Many instances of regularized inverse problems can be interpreted as special cases of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Books/InverseProblemTheory.pdf|title=Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation|pages=i\u2013xii|first=Albert|last=Tarantola|publisher=SIAM|doi=10.1137/1.9780898717921.fm|chapter=Front Matter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-572-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of the optimization problem ====\nSome inverse problems have a very simple solution, for instance, when one has a set of [[unisolvent functions]], meaning a set of {{tmath|n}} functions such that evaluating them at {{tmath|n}} distinct points yields a set of [[linearly independent]] vectors. This means that given a linear combination of these functions, the coefficients can be computed by arranging the vectors as the columns of a matrix and then inverting this matrix. The simplest example of unisolvent functions are polynomials constructed, using the [[unisolvence theorem]], so as to be unisolvent. Concretely, this is done by inverting the [[Vandermonde matrix]]. But this a very specific situation.\n\nIn general, the solution of an inverse problem requires sophisticated optimization algorithms. When the model is described by a large number of parameters (the number of unknowns involved in some diffraction tomography applications can reach one billion), solving the linear system associated with the normal equations can be cumbersome. The numerical method to be used for solving the optimization problem depends in particular on the cost required for computing the solution  <math>F p</math> of the forward problem. Once chosen the appropriate algorithm for solving the forward problem (a straightforward matrix-vector multiplication may be not adequate when matrix <math>F</math> is huge), the appropriate algorithm for carrying out the minimization can be found in textbooks dealing with numerical methods for the solution of linear systems and for the minimization of quadratic functions (see for instance Ciarlet<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ciarlet |first1=Philippe |title=Introduction \u00e0 l'analyse num\u00e9rique matricielle et \u00e0 l'optimisation |date=1994 |publisher=Masson |location=Paris |isbn=9782225688935}}</ref> or Nocedal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |title=Numerical optimization |date=2006 |publisher=Springer}}</ref>).\n\nAlso, the user may wish to add physical constraints to the models: In this case, they have to be familiar with [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization methods]], a subject in itself. In all cases, computing the gradient of the objective function often is a key element for the solution of the optimization problem. As mentioned above, information about the spatial distribution of a distributed parameter can be introduced through the parametrization. One can also think of adapting this parametrization during the optimization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben Ameur |first1=Hend |last2=Chavent |first2=Guy |last3=Jaffr\u00e9 |first3=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Refinement and coarsening indicators for adaptive parametrization: application to the estimation of hydraulic transmissivities |journal=Inverse Problems |date=2002 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=775\u2013794|url=https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/22/95/PDF/RR-4292.pdf|doi=10.1088/0266-5611/18/3/317 |bibcode=2002InvPr..18..775B }}</ref>\n\nShould the objective function be based on a norm other than the Euclidean norm, we have to leave the area of quadratic optimization. As a result, the optimization problem becomes more difficult. In particular, when the <math>L^1</math> norm is used for quantifying the data misfit the objective function is no longer differentiable: its gradient does not make sense any longer. Dedicated methods (see for instance Lemar\u00e9chal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lemar\u00e9chal |first1=Claude |title=Optimization, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science |date=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=529\u2013572}}</ref>) from non differentiable optimization come in.\n\nOnce, the optimal model computed, we have to address the question: \"Can we trust this model?\" The question can be formulated as follows: How large is the set of models that match the data \"nearly as well\" as this model? In the case of quadratic objective functions, this set is contained in a hyper-ellipsoid, a subset of <math>{R}^M</math> (<math>M</math> is the number of unknowns), whose size depends on what we mean with \"nearly as well\", that is on the noise level. The direction of the largest axis of this ellipsoid ([[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] associated with the smallest eigenvalue of matrix <math>F^TF</math>) is the direction of poorly determined components: if we follow this direction, we can bring a strong perturbation to the model without changing significantly the value of the objective function and thus end up with a significantly different quasi-optimal model. We clearly see that the answer to the question \"can we trust this model\" is governed by the noise level and by the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the objective function or equivalently, in the case where no regularization has been integrated, by the [[singular value]]s of matrix <math>F</math>. Of course, the use of regularization (or other kinds of prior information) reduces the size of the set of almost optimal solutions and, in turn, increases the confidence we can put in the computed solution.\n\n==== Stability, regularization and model discretization in infinite dimension ====\n\nWe focus here on the recovery of a distributed parameter.\nWhen looking for distributed parameters we have to discretize these unknown functions. Doing so, we reduce the dimension of the problem to something finite. But now, the question is : is there any link between the solution we compute and the one of the initial problem ? Then another question : what do we mean with the solution of the initial problem ? Since a finite number of data does not allow the determination of an infinity of unknowns, the original data misfit functional has to be regularized to ensure uniqueness of the solution. Many times, reducing the unknowns to a finite dimensional space will provide an adequate regularization : the computed solution will look like a discrete version of the solution we were looking for. For example, a naive discretization will often work for solving the [[deconvolution]] problem : it will work as long as we do not allow missing frequencies to show up in the numerical solution. But many times, regularization has to be integrated explicitly in the objective function.\n\nIn order to understand what may happen, we have to keep in mind that solving such a linear inverse problem amount to solving a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind: \n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Omega}K(x,y)p(y) dy</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is the kernel, <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are vectors of <math>{R}^2</math>, and <math>{\\Omega}</math> is a domain in <math>{R}^2</math>. This holds for a 2D application. For a 3D application, we consider <math> x,y\\in {R}^3</math>. Note that here the model parameters <math>p</math> consist of a function and that the response of a model also consists of a function denoted by <math>d(x)</math>. This equation is an extension to infinite dimension of the matrix equation <math>d=Fp</math> given in the case of discrete problems.\n\nFor sufficiently smooth <math>K</math> the operator defined above is [[compact operator|compact]] on reasonable [[Banach space]]s such as the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math>]]. [[Compact operator|F. Riesz theory]] states that the set of singular values of such an operator contains zero (hence the existence of a null-space), is finite or at most countable, and, in the latter case, they constitute a sequence that goes to zero. In the case of a symmetric kernel, we have an infinity of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors constitute a hilbertian basis of <math>L^2</math>.  Thus any solution of this equation is determined up to an additive function in the null-space and, in the case of infinity of singular values, the solution (which involves the reciprocal of arbitrary small eigenvalues) is unstable : two ingredients that make the solution of this integral equation a typical ill-posed problem! However we can define a solution through the [[Generalized inverse|pseudo-inverse]] of the forward map (again up to an arbitrary additive function). When the forward map is compact, the classical [[Tikhonov regularization]] will work if we use it for integrating prior information stating that the <math>L^2</math> norm of the solution should be as small as possible : this will make the inverse problem well-posed. Yet, as in the finite dimension case, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution. Again, basically, the information lies in the eigenvalues of the Hessian operator. Should subspaces containing eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues be explored for computing the solution, then the solution can hardly be trusted : some of its components will be poorly determined. The smallest eigenvalue is equal to the weight introduced in Tikhonov regularization.\n\nIrregular kernels may yield a forward map which is not compact and even [[Unbounded operator|unbounded]] if we naively equip the space of models with the <math>L^2</math> norm. In such cases, the Hessian is not a bounded operator and the notion of eigenvalue does not make sense any longer. A mathematical analysis is required to make it a [[bounded operator]] and design a well-posed problem: an illustration can be found in.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title= SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts 1991|date=1993 |volume=98 |pages=6589\u20136605|doi=10.1190/1.1888774 |chapter=Ill\u2010posed and well\u2010posed formulations of the reflection tomography problem }}</ref> Again, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution and we have to generalize the notion of eigenvalue to get the answer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title=What information on the Earth model do reflection traveltimes provide |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1992 |volume=98 |issue=B13 |pages=827\u2013844|doi=10.1029/92JB01739 |bibcode=1992JGR....9719827D }}</ref>\n\nAnalysis of the spectrum of the Hessian operator is thus a key element to determine how reliable the computed solution is.  However, such an analysis is usually a very heavy task. This has led several authors to investigate alternative approaches in the case where we are not interested in all the components of the unknown function but only in sub-unknowns that are the images of the unknown function by a linear operator.

We denote by <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> the line in this family associated with measurement point <math>x</math>. The observation at <math>x</math> can thus be written as :\n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Gamma_x} w(x,y) p(y) \\, ds</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is the arc-length along <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> and <math>w(x,y)</math> a known weighting function.

With such a kernel, the forward map is not compact.\n\n===== Computed tomography =====\nIn [[X-ray computed tomography]] the lines on which the parameter is integrated are straight lines : the [[tomographic reconstruction]] of the parameter distribution is based on the inversion of the [[Radon transform]]. Although from a theoretical point of view many linear inverse problems are well understood, problems involving the Radon transform and its generalisations still present many theoretical challenges with questions of sufficiency of data still unresolved. Such problems include incomplete data for the x-ray transform in three dimensions and problems involving the generalisation of the x-ray transform to tensor fields.

In 3D the parameter is not integrated along lines but over surfaces. Should the propagation velocity be constant, such points are distributed on an ellipsoid. The inverse problems consists in retrieving the distribution of diffracting points from the seismograms recorded along the survey, the velocity distribution being known.

As explained in Marsh<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Tom |title=Doppler tomography |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=296 |date=2005 |issue=1\u20134 |pages=403\u2013415 |doi=10.1007/s10509-005-4859-3 |arxiv=astro-ph/0011020 }}</ref> this linear inverse problem is tomography like : we have to recover a distributed parameter which has been integrated along lines to produce its effects in the recordings.\n\n==Non-linear inverse problems==\n\nNon-linear inverse problems constitute an inherently more difficult family of inverse problems. Here the forward map <math>F</math> is a non-linear operator. Modeling of physical phenomena often relies on the solution of a partial differential equation (see table above except for gravity law) : although these partial differential equations are often linear, the physical parameters that appear in these equations depend in a non-linear way of the state of the system and therefore on the observations we make on it.\n\n=== Some classical non-linear inverse problems ===\n\n==== Inverse scattering problems ====\n\nWhereas linear inverse problems were completely solved from the theoretical point of view at the end of the nineteenth century {{Citation needed|reason=What specific date ? Is there a publication that marks the complete solution of linear inverse problems ?|date=November 2019}}, only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) [[inverse scattering problem]]s, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school ([[Mark Grigoryevich Krein|Krein]], [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]], Levitan, [[Vladimir Marchenko|Marchenko]]). A large review of the results has been given by Chadan and Sabatier in their book \"Inverse Problems of Quantum Scattering Theory\" (two editions in English, one in Russian).\n\nIn this kind of problem, data are properties of the spectrum of a linear operator which describe the scattering. The spectrum is made of [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenfunction]]s, forming together the \"discrete spectrum\", and generalizations, called the continuous spectrum. The very remarkable physical point is that scattering experiments give information only on the continuous spectrum, and that knowing its full spectrum is both necessary and sufficient in recovering the scattering operator. Hence we have invisible parameters, much more interesting than the null space which has a similar property in linear inverse problems. In addition, there are physical motions in which the spectrum of such an operator is conserved as a consequence of such motion. This phenomenon is governed by special nonlinear partial differential evolution equations, for example the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]]. If the spectrum of the operator is reduced to one single eigenvalue, its corresponding motion is that of a single bump that propagates at constant velocity and without deformation, a solitary wave called a \"[[soliton]]\".\n\nA perfect signal and its generalizations for the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation or other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations are of great interest, with many possible applications. This area has been studied as a branch of mathematical physics since the 1970s. Nonlinear inverse problems are also currently studied in many fields of applied science (acoustics, mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetic scattering - in particular radar soundings, seismic soundings, and nearly all imaging modalities).\n\nA final example related to the [[Riemann hypothesis]] was given by Wu and Sprung, the idea is that in the [[semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] [[old quantum theory]] the inverse of the potential inside the Hamiltonian is proportional to the [[half-derivative]] of the eigenvalues (energies) counting function&nbsp;''n''(''x'').\n\n====Permeability matching in oil and gas reservoirs====\nThe goal is to recover the diffusion coefficient in the [[Diffusion equation|parabolic partial differential equation]] that models single phase fluid flows in porous media.

In particular they aimed at inverting for the propagation velocity distribution, knowing the arrival times of wave-fronts observed on seismograms. These wave-fronts can be associated with direct arrivals or with reflections associated with reflectors whose geometry is to be determined, jointly with the velocity distribution.\n\nThe arrival time distribution  <math>{\\tau}(x)</math> (<math>x</math> is a point in physical space) of a wave-front issued from a point source, satisfies the [[Eikonal equation]] :\n:<math>\\|\\nabla {\\tau} (x)\\| =  s(x),</math>\nwhere <math>s(x)</math> denotes the [[Slowness (seismology)|slowness]] (reciprocal of the velocity) distribution. The presence of <math>\\| \\| </math> makes this equation nonlinear. It is classically solved by shooting [[Ray tracing (physics)|rays]] (trajectories about which the arrival time is stationary) from the point source.\n\nThis problem is tomography like : the measured arrival times are the integral along the ray-path of the slowness. But this tomography like problem is nonlinear, mainly because the unknown ray-path geometry depends upon the velocity (or slowness) distribution. In spite of its nonlinear character, travel-time tomography turned out to be very effective for determining the propagation velocity in the Earth or in the subsurface, the latter aspect being a key element for seismic imaging, in particular using methods mentioned in Section \"Diffraction tomography\".\n\n=== Mathematical aspects: Hadamard's questions ===\n\nThe questions concern well-posedness: Does the least-squares problem have a unique solution which depends continuously on the data (stability problem)?

It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.\n\nInverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in [[system identification]], [[optics]], [[radar]], [[acoustics]], [[communication theory]], [[signal processing]], [[medical imaging]], [[computer vision]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[astronomy]], [[remote sensing]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine learning]], [[nondestructive testing]], and many other fields.\n\n==History==\nStarting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries. A historical example is the calculations of [[John Couch Adams|Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]] which led to the discovery of [[Neptune]] from the perturbed trajectory of [[Uranus]]. However, a formal study of inverse problems was not initiated until the 20th century.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a solution to an inverse problem was discovered by [[Hermann Weyl]] and published in 1911, describing the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |title=\u00dcber die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte |journal=Nachrichten der K\u00f6niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen |pages=110\u2013117 |year=1911 |access-date=2018-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801090504/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today known as ''[[Weyl's law]]'', it is perhaps most easily understood as an answer to the question of whether it is possible to [[Hearing the shape of a drum|hear the shape of a drum]]. Weyl conjectured that the eigenfrequencies of a drum would be related to the area and perimeter of the drum by a particular equation, a result improved upon by later mathematicians.\n\nThe field of inverse problems was later touched on by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] physicist, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]].<ref>[http://ambartsumian.ru/en/papers/epilogue-ambartsumian\u2019-s-paper/ \u00bb Epilogue \u2014 Ambartsumian\u2019 s paper Viktor Ambartsumian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A life in astrophysics.

He then asked: given a family of eigenvalues, is it possible to find the form of the equations whose eigenvalues they are? Essentially Ambartsumian was examining the inverse [[Sturm\u2013Liouville problem]], which dealt with determining the equations of a vibrating string. This paper was published in 1929 in the German physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' and remained in obscurity for a rather long time. Describing this situation after many decades, Ambartsumian said, \"If an astronomer publishes an article with a mathematical content in a physics journal, then the most likely thing that will happen to it is oblivion.\"\n\nNonetheless, toward the end of the Second World War, this article, written by the 20-year-old Ambartsumian, was found by Swedish mathematicians and formed the starting point for a whole area of research on inverse problems, becoming the foundation of an entire discipline.\n\nThen important efforts have been devoted to a \"direct solution\" of the inverse scattering problem especially by [[Marchenko equation|Gelfand and Levitan]] in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Burridge |first1=Robert |title=The Gelfand-Levitan, the Marchenko, and the Gopinath-Sondhi integral equations of inverse scattering theory, regarded in the context of inverse impulse-response problems |journal=Wave Motion |date=1980 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013323 |doi=10.1016/0165-2125(80)90011-6 }}</ref> They proposed an analytic constructive method for determining the solution.  When computers became available, some authors have investigated the possibility of applying their approach to similar problems such as the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation. But it rapidly turned out that the inversion is an unstable process : noise and errors can be tremendously amplified making a direct solution hardly practicable.\nThen, around the seventies, the least-squares and probabilistic approaches came in and turned out to be very helpful for the determination of parameters involved in various physical systems. This approach met a lot of success. Nowadays inverse problems are also investigated in fields outside physics, such as chemistry, economy, and computer science. Eventually, as numerical models invade the whole society, we may expect an inverse problem associated with each of these numerical models.\n\n==Conceptual understanding==\nSince Newton, scientists have extensively attempted to model the world. In particular, when a [[mathematical model]] is available (for instance, Newton's gravitational law or Coulomb's equation for electrostatics), we can foresee, given some parameters that describe a physical system (such as a distribution of mass or a distribution of electric charges), the behavior of the system. This approach is known as mathematical modeling and the above-mentioned physical parameters are called the '''model parameters''' or simply the '''model'''. To be precise, we introduce the notion of '''state of the physical system''': it is the solution of the mathematical model's equation. In [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], these equations are referred to as the [[State-space representation|state equations]]. In many situations we are not truly interested in knowing the physical state but just its effects on some objects (for instance, the effects the gravitational field on a specific planet). Hence we have to introduce another operator, called the '''observation operator''', which converts the state of the physical system (here the predicted gravitational field) into what we want to observe (here the movements of the considered planet). We can now introduce the so-called '''forward problem''', which consists of two steps:\n* determination of the state of the system from the physical parameters that describe it\n* application of the observation operator to estimated state of the system so as to predict the behavior of what we want to observe.\nThis leads to introduce another [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] <math>F</math> ('''''F''''' stands for \"forward\") which maps model parameters <math>p</math> into <math>F(p)</math>, the data that model <math>p</math> predicts that is the result of this two-step procedure. Operator <math>F</math> is called '''forward operator''' or '''forward map'''.\nIn this approach we basically attempt at predicting the effects knowing the causes.\n\nThe table below shows, the Earth being considered as the physical system and for different physical phenomena, the model parameters that describe the system, the physical quantity that describes the state of the physical system and observations commonly made on the state of the system. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Governing equations !! Model parameters !! State of the physical system !!

We denote by <math>M</math> the number (possibly infinite) of model parameters, and by <math>N</math> the number of recorded data.\nWe introduce some useful concepts and the associated notations that will be used in the sequel :\n* The '''space of models''' denoted by <math>P</math> : the [[vector space]] spanned by model parameters; it has <math>M</math> dimensions;\n* The '''space of data''' denoted by <math>D</math> : <math>D=\\mathbb{R}^N</math> if we organize the measured samples in a vector with <math>N</math> components (if our measurements consist of functions, <math>D</math> is a vector space with infinite dimensions);\n* <math>F(p)</math> : the '''response of model'''   <math>p</math>; it consists of the '''data predicted by model''' <math>p</math>;\n* <math>F(P)</math> : the image of <math>P</math> by the forward map, it is a subset of <math>D</math> (but not a subspace unless <math>F</math> is linear) made of responses of all models;\n* <math>d_{obs}-F(p)</math> : the '''data misfits (or residuals)''' associated with model  <math>p</math> : they can be arranged as a vector, an element of <math>D</math>.\nThe concept of residuals is very important : in the scope of finding a model that matches the data, '''their analysis reveals if the considered model can be considered as realistic or not'''. Systematic unrealistic discrepancies between the data and the model responses also reveals that the forward map is inadequate and may give insights about an improved forward map.\n\nWhen operator <math>F</math> is linear, the inverse problem is linear. Otherwise, that is most often, the inverse problem is nonlinear.\nAlso, models cannot always be described by a finite number of parameters. It is the case when we look for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed parameters]] (a distribution of wave-speeds for instance): in such cases the goal of the inverse problem is to retrieve one or several functions. Such inverse problems are inverse problems with infinite dimension.\n\n==<span id=\"Linear inverse problem\"></span>Linear inverse problems==\nIn the case of a linear forward map and when we deal with a finite number of model parameters, the forward map can be written as a [[linear system]]\n:<math>\\ d = Fp</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that characterizes the forward map.\n\n===An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field===\nOnly a few physical systems are actually linear with respect to the model parameters. One such system from geophysics is that of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]. The Earth's gravitational field is determined by the density distribution of the Earth in the subsurface. Because the [[lithology]] of the Earth changes quite significantly, we are able to observe minute differences in the Earth's gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. From our understanding of gravity (Newton's Law of Gravitation), we know that the mathematical expression for gravity is:\n:<math>d= \\frac{G p}{r^2};</math>\nhere <math>d</math> is a measure of the local gravitational acceleration, <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational acceleration|universal gravitational constant]], <math>p</math> is the local mass (which is related to density) of the rock in the subsurface and <math>r</math> is the distance from the mass to the observation point.\n\nBy discretizing the above expression, we are able to relate the discrete data observations on the surface of the Earth to the discrete model parameters (density) in the subsurface that we wish to know more about. For example, consider the case where we have measurements carried out at 5 locations on the surface of the Earth. In this case, our data vector, <math>d</math> is a column vector of dimension (5x1): its <math>i</math>th component is associated with the <math>i</math>th observation location.  We also know that we only have five unknown masses <math>p_j</math> in the subsurface (unrealistic but used to demonstrate the concept) with known location : we denote by <math>r_{ij}</math> the distance between the <math>i</math>th observation location and the <math>j</math>th mass. Thus, we can construct the linear system relating the five unknown masses to the five data points as follows:\n:<math>d = F p, \\,</math>\n:<math>d =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nd_1 \\\\\nd_2 \\\\\nd_3 \\\\\nd_4 \\\\\nd_5 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>p =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_1 \\\\\np_2 \\\\\np_3 \\\\\np_4 \\\\\np_5\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>F =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{G}{r_{11}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{12}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{13}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{14}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{15}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{21}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{22}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{23}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{24}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{25}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{31}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{32}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{33}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{34}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{35}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{41}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{42}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{43}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{44}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{45}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{51}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{52}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{53}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{54}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{55}^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nTo solve for the model parameters that fit our data, we might be able to invert the matrix <math>F</math> to directly convert the measurements into our model parameters. For example:\n:<math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math>\nA system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation : our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix <math>F</math> is not square.\n\nHowever, even a square matrix can have no inverse : matrix <math>F</math> can be [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.\nAlso noise may corrupt our observations making <math>d</math> possibly outside the space <math>F(P)</math> of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> may not exist. This is another difficulty.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the first difficulty ====\nThe first difficulty reflects a crucial problem: Our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical '''prior information''' on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence. It can also come from other experiments: For instance, we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. \nThe integration of this additional information is basically a problem of [[statistics]]. This discipline is the one that can answer the question: How to mix quantities of different nature? We will be more precise in the section \"Bayesian approach\" below.\n\nConcerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists of information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the \"simplest\" model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by [[Penalty method|penalizing]] the [[Lp space|<math>L^1</math> norm]] of the gradient (or the [[total variation]]) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces freedom degrees only when necessary.\n\nAdditional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case, the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a '''subset of admissible models''' denoted by <math>P_{adm}</math> in the sequel.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the second difficulty ====\nAs mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for [[model selection|the best (or optimal) model]]: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an [[objective function]], namely a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]  that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, <math>\\varphi</math>, is of the form:\n:<math>\\varphi(p) = \\|F p-d_{obs} \\|^2 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\| \\| \\,</math> is the Euclidean norm (it will be the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math> norm]] when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of [[Least squares|ordinary least squares]], an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers: to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the <math>L^1</math> norm, in replacement of the <math>L^2</math> norm.\n\n==== Bayesian approach ====\nVery similar to the least-squares approach is the probabilistic approach: If we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, which is the model that matches the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood criterion]]. If the noise is [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the [[Covariance|co-variance]] of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using [[Bayesian inference]] to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola's book.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantola |first1=Albert |title=Inverse problem theory |url=https://archive.org/details/inverseproblemth0000tara |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780444599674 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of our elementary example ====\nHere we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model <math>p_{opt}</math>, this gradient vanishes which can be written as :\n:<math>\\nabla_p \\varphi = 2(F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} - F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs}) = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere ''F''<sup>T</sup> denotes the [[matrix transpose]] of ''F''. This equation simplifies to:\n:<math>F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} = F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs} \\,</math>\n\nThis expression is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Normal_equations&redirect=no normal equation] and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. \nIn our example matrix <math>F^\\mathrm{T} F</math> turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters : we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution.\n\n=== Mathematical and computational aspects ===\n\nInverse problems are typically ill posed, as opposed to the [[well-posed problem]]s usually met in mathematical modeling. Of the three conditions for a [[well-posed problem]] suggested by [[Jacques Hadamard]] (existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution or solutions) the condition of stability is most often violated. In the sense of [[functional analysis]], the inverse problem is represented by a mapping between [[metric space]]s. While inverse problems are often formulated in infinite dimensional spaces, limitations to a finite number of measurements, and the practical consideration of recovering only a finite number of unknown parameters, may lead to the problems being recast in discrete form. In this case the inverse problem will typically be ''[[condition number|ill-conditioned]]''. In these cases, [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] may be used to introduce mild assumptions on the solution and prevent [[overfitting]]. Many instances of regularized inverse problems can be interpreted as special cases of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Books/InverseProblemTheory.pdf|title=Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation|pages=i\u2013xii|first=Albert|last=Tarantola|publisher=SIAM|doi=10.1137/1.9780898717921.fm|chapter=Front Matter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-572-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of the optimization problem ====\nSome inverse problems have a very simple solution, for instance, when one has a set of [[unisolvent functions]], meaning a set of {{tmath|n}} functions such that evaluating them at {{tmath|n}} distinct points yields a set of [[linearly independent]] vectors. This means that given a linear combination of these functions, the coefficients can be computed by arranging the vectors as the columns of a matrix and then inverting this matrix. The simplest example of unisolvent functions are polynomials constructed, using the [[unisolvence theorem]], so as to be unisolvent. Concretely, this is done by inverting the [[Vandermonde matrix]]. But this a very specific situation.\n\nIn general, the solution of an inverse problem requires sophisticated optimization algorithms. When the model is described by a large number of parameters (the number of unknowns involved in some diffraction tomography applications can reach one billion), solving the linear system associated with the normal equations can be cumbersome. The numerical method to be used for solving the optimization problem depends in particular on the cost required for computing the solution  <math>F p</math> of the forward problem. Once chosen the appropriate algorithm for solving the forward problem (a straightforward matrix-vector multiplication may be not adequate when matrix <math>F</math> is huge), the appropriate algorithm for carrying out the minimization can be found in textbooks dealing with numerical methods for the solution of linear systems and for the minimization of quadratic functions (see for instance Ciarlet<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ciarlet |first1=Philippe |title=Introduction \u00e0 l'analyse num\u00e9rique matricielle et \u00e0 l'optimisation |date=1994 |publisher=Masson |location=Paris |isbn=9782225688935}}</ref> or Nocedal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |title=Numerical optimization |date=2006 |publisher=Springer}}</ref>).\n\nAlso, the user may wish to add physical constraints to the models: In this case, they have to be familiar with [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization methods]], a subject in itself. In all cases, computing the gradient of the objective function often is a key element for the solution of the optimization problem. As mentioned above, information about the spatial distribution of a distributed parameter can be introduced through the parametrization. One can also think of adapting this parametrization during the optimization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben Ameur |first1=Hend |last2=Chavent |first2=Guy |last3=Jaffr\u00e9 |first3=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Refinement and coarsening indicators for adaptive parametrization: application to the estimation of hydraulic transmissivities |journal=Inverse Problems |date=2002 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=775\u2013794|url=https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/22/95/PDF/RR-4292.pdf|doi=10.1088/0266-5611/18/3/317 |bibcode=2002InvPr..18..775B }}</ref>\n\nShould the objective function be based on a norm other than the Euclidean norm, we have to leave the area of quadratic optimization. As a result, the optimization problem becomes more difficult. In particular, when the <math>L^1</math> norm is used for quantifying the data misfit the objective function is no longer differentiable: its gradient does not make sense any longer. Dedicated methods (see for instance Lemar\u00e9chal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lemar\u00e9chal |first1=Claude |title=Optimization, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science |date=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=529\u2013572}}</ref>) from non differentiable optimization come in.\n\nOnce, the optimal model computed, we have to address the question: \"Can we trust this model?\" The question can be formulated as follows: How large is the set of models that match the data \"nearly as well\" as this model? In the case of quadratic objective functions, this set is contained in a hyper-ellipsoid, a subset of <math>{R}^M</math> (<math>M</math> is the number of unknowns), whose size depends on what we mean with \"nearly as well\", that is on the noise level. The direction of the largest axis of this ellipsoid ([[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] associated with the smallest eigenvalue of matrix <math>F^TF</math>) is the direction of poorly determined components: if we follow this direction, we can bring a strong perturbation to the model without changing significantly the value of the objective function and thus end up with a significantly different quasi-optimal model. We clearly see that the answer to the question \"can we trust this model\" is governed by the noise level and by the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the objective function or equivalently, in the case where no regularization has been integrated, by the [[singular value]]s of matrix <math>F</math>. Of course, the use of regularization (or other kinds of prior information) reduces the size of the set of almost optimal solutions and, in turn, increases the confidence we can put in the computed solution.\n\n==== Stability, regularization and model discretization in infinite dimension ====\n\nWe focus here on the recovery of a distributed parameter.\nWhen looking for distributed parameters we have to discretize these unknown functions. Doing so, we reduce the dimension of the problem to something finite. But now, the question is : is there any link between the solution we compute and the one of the initial problem ? Then another question : what do we mean with the solution of the initial problem ? Since a finite number of data does not allow the determination of an infinity of unknowns, the original data misfit functional has to be regularized to ensure uniqueness of the solution. Many times, reducing the unknowns to a finite dimensional space will provide an adequate regularization : the computed solution will look like a discrete version of the solution we were looking for. For example, a naive discretization will often work for solving the [[deconvolution]] problem : it will work as long as we do not allow missing frequencies to show up in the numerical solution. But many times, regularization has to be integrated explicitly in the objective function.\n\nIn order to understand what may happen, we have to keep in mind that solving such a linear inverse problem amount to solving a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind: \n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Omega}K(x,y)p(y) dy</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is the kernel, <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are vectors of <math>{R}^2</math>, and <math>{\\Omega}</math> is a domain in <math>{R}^2</math>. This holds for a 2D application. For a 3D application, we consider <math> x,y\\in {R}^3</math>. Note that here the model parameters <math>p</math> consist of a function and that the response of a model also consists of a function denoted by <math>d(x)</math>. This equation is an extension to infinite dimension of the matrix equation <math>d=Fp</math> given in the case of discrete problems.\n\nFor sufficiently smooth <math>K</math> the operator defined above is [[compact operator|compact]] on reasonable [[Banach space]]s such as the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math>]]. [[Compact operator|F. Riesz theory]] states that the set of singular values of such an operator contains zero (hence the existence of a null-space), is finite or at most countable, and, in the latter case, they constitute a sequence that goes to zero. In the case of a symmetric kernel, we have an infinity of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors constitute a hilbertian basis of <math>L^2</math>.  Thus any solution of this equation is determined up to an additive function in the null-space and, in the case of infinity of singular values, the solution (which involves the reciprocal of arbitrary small eigenvalues) is unstable : two ingredients that make the solution of this integral equation a typical ill-posed problem! However we can define a solution through the [[Generalized inverse|pseudo-inverse]] of the forward map (again up to an arbitrary additive function). When the forward map is compact, the classical [[Tikhonov regularization]] will work if we use it for integrating prior information stating that the <math>L^2</math> norm of the solution should be as small as possible : this will make the inverse problem well-posed. Yet, as in the finite dimension case, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution. Again, basically, the information lies in the eigenvalues of the Hessian operator. Should subspaces containing eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues be explored for computing the solution, then the solution can hardly be trusted : some of its components will be poorly determined. The smallest eigenvalue is equal to the weight introduced in Tikhonov regularization.\n\nIrregular kernels may yield a forward map which is not compact and even [[Unbounded operator|unbounded]] if we naively equip the space of models with the <math>L^2</math> norm. In such cases, the Hessian is not a bounded operator and the notion of eigenvalue does not make sense any longer. A mathematical analysis is required to make it a [[bounded operator]] and design a well-posed problem: an illustration can be found in.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title= SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts 1991|date=1993 |volume=98 |pages=6589\u20136605|doi=10.1190/1.1888774 |chapter=Ill\u2010posed and well\u2010posed formulations of the reflection tomography problem }}</ref> Again, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution and we have to generalize the notion of eigenvalue to get the answer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title=What information on the Earth model do reflection traveltimes provide |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1992 |volume=98 |issue=B13 |pages=827\u2013844|doi=10.1029/92JB01739 |bibcode=1992JGR....9719827D }}</ref>\n\nAnalysis of the spectrum of the Hessian operator is thus a key element to determine how reliable the computed solution is.  However, such an analysis is usually a very heavy task.

Although from a theoretical point of view many linear inverse problems are well understood, problems involving the Radon transform and its generalisations still present many theoretical challenges with questions of sufficiency of data still unresolved. Such problems include incomplete data for the x-ray transform in three dimensions and problems involving the generalisation of the x-ray transform to tensor fields.

In 3D the parameter is not integrated along lines but over surfaces. Should the propagation velocity be constant, such points are distributed on an ellipsoid. The inverse problems consists in retrieving the distribution of diffracting points from the seismograms recorded along the survey, the velocity distribution being known.

Is there a publication that marks the complete solution of linear inverse problems ?|date=November 2019}}, only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) [[inverse scattering problem]]s, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school ([[Mark Grigoryevich Krein|Krein]], [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]], Levitan, [[Vladimir Marchenko|Marchenko]]). A large review of the results has been given by Chadan and Sabatier in their book \"Inverse Problems of Quantum Scattering Theory\" (two editions in English, one in Russian).\n\nIn this kind of problem, data are properties of the spectrum of a linear operator which describe the scattering. The spectrum is made of [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenfunction]]s, forming together the \"discrete spectrum\", and generalizations, called the continuous spectrum. The very remarkable physical point is that scattering experiments give information only on the continuous spectrum, and that knowing its full spectrum is both necessary and sufficient in recovering the scattering operator. Hence we have invisible parameters, much more interesting than the null space which has a similar property in linear inverse problems. In addition, there are physical motions in which the spectrum of such an operator is conserved as a consequence of such motion. This phenomenon is governed by special nonlinear partial differential evolution equations, for example the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]]. If the spectrum of the operator is reduced to one single eigenvalue, its corresponding motion is that of a single bump that propagates at constant velocity and without deformation, a solitary wave called a \"[[soliton]]\".\n\nA perfect signal and its generalizations for the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation or other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations are of great interest, with many possible applications. This area has been studied as a branch of mathematical physics since the 1970s. Nonlinear inverse problems are also currently studied in many fields of applied science (acoustics, mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetic scattering - in particular radar soundings, seismic soundings, and nearly all imaging modalities).\n\nA final example related to the [[Riemann hypothesis]] was given by Wu and Sprung, the idea is that in the [[semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] [[old quantum theory]] the inverse of the potential inside the Hamiltonian is proportional to the [[half-derivative]] of the eigenvalues (energies) counting function&nbsp;''n''(''x'').\n\n====Permeability matching in oil and gas reservoirs====\nThe goal is to recover the diffusion coefficient in the [[Diffusion equation|parabolic partial differential equation]] that models single phase fluid flows in porous media. This problem has been the object of many studies since a pioneering work carried out in the early seventies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |last2=Lemonnier |first2=Patrick |last3=Dupuy |first3=Michel |title=History Matching by Use of Optimal Control Theory |journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal |date=1975 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=74\u201386 |doi=10.2118/4627-PA}}</ref> Concerning two-phase flows an important problem is to estimate the relative permeabilities and the capillary pressures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |last2=Cohen |first2=Gary |last3=Espy |first3=M. |title=Determination of relative permeabilities and capillary pressures by an automatic adjustment method |journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers |date=1980 |issue=January |doi=10.2118/9237-MS}}</ref>\n\n==== Inverse problems in the wave equations ====\n\nThe goal is to recover the wave-speeds (P and S waves) and the density distributions from [[seismogram]]s. Such inverse problems are of prime interest in seismology.\nWe can basically consider two mathematical models :\n* The [[Wave equation|acoustic wave equation]] (in which S waves are ignored when the space dimensions are 2 or 3)\n* The [[Linear elasticity|elastodynamics equation]] in which the P and S wave velocities can be derived from the [[Lam\u00e9 parameters]] and the density.\nThese basic [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic equations]] can be upgraded by incorporating [[attenuation]], [[anisotropy]],...\n\nThe solution of the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation has been the object of many studies.

In particular they aimed at inverting for the propagation velocity distribution, knowing the arrival times of wave-fronts observed on seismograms. These wave-fronts can be associated with direct arrivals or with reflections associated with reflectors whose geometry is to be determined, jointly with the velocity distribution.\n\nThe arrival time distribution  <math>{\\tau}(x)</math> (<math>x</math> is a point in physical space) of a wave-front issued from a point source, satisfies the [[Eikonal equation]] :\n:<math>\\|\\nabla {\\tau} (x)\\| =  s(x),</math>\nwhere <math>s(x)</math> denotes the [[Slowness (seismology)|slowness]] (reciprocal of the velocity) distribution. The presence of <math>\\| \\| </math> makes this equation nonlinear. It is classically solved by shooting [[Ray tracing (physics)|rays]] (trajectories about which the arrival time is stationary) from the point source.\n\nThis problem is tomography like : the measured arrival times are the integral along the ray-path of the slowness. But this tomography like problem is nonlinear, mainly because the unknown ray-path geometry depends upon the velocity (or slowness) distribution. In spite of its nonlinear character, travel-time tomography turned out to be very effective for determining the propagation velocity in the Earth or in the subsurface, the latter aspect being a key element for seismic imaging, in particular using methods mentioned in Section \"Diffraction tomography\".\n\n=== Mathematical aspects : Hadamard's questions ===\n\nThe questions concern well-posedness : does the least-squares problem have a unique solution which depends continuously on the data (stability problem) ? It is the first question, but it is also a difficult one because of the non-linearity of <math>F</math>. \nIn order to see where the difficulties arise from, Chavent<ref name=Chavent>{{cite book |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |title=Nonlinear Least Squares for Inverse problems |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2785-6}}</ref> proposed to conceptually split the minimization of the data misfit function into two consecutive steps (<math>P_{adm}</math> is the subset of admissible models):\n* projection step : given <math>d_{obs}</math> find a projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> (nearest point on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> according to the distance involved in the definition of the objective function)\n* given this projection find one pre-image that is a model whose image by operator <math>F</math> is this projection.\nDifficulties can - and usually will - arise in both steps :\n# operator <math>F</math> is not likely to be one-to-one, therefore there can be more than one pre-image,\n# even when <math>F</math> is one-to-one, its inverse may not be continuous over <math>F(P)</math> ,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> may not exist, should this set be not closed,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> can be non-unique and not continuous as this can be non-convex due to the non-linearity of <math>F</math>.\nWe refer to Chavent<ref name=Chavent/> for a mathematical analysis of these points.\n\n=== Computational aspects ===\n\n==== A non-convex data misfit function ====\nThe forward map being nonlinear, the data misfit function is likely to be non-convex, making local minimization techniques inefficient. Several approaches have been investigated to overcome this difficulty : \n* use of global optimization techniques such as sampling of the posterior density function and [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm|Metropolis algorithm]] in the inverse problem probabilistic framework,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koren |first1=Zvi |last2=Mosegaard |first2=Klaus |last3=Landa |first3=Evgeny |last4=Thore |first4=Pierre |last5=Tarantola |first5=Albert |title=Monte Carlo Estimation and Resolution Analysis of Seismic Background Velocities |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1991 |volume=96 |issue=B12|pages=20289\u201320299 |doi=10.1029/91JB02278 |bibcode=1991JGR....9620289K }}</ref> genetic algorithms (alone or in combination with Metropolis algorithm : see<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad|title=Stochastic shale permeability matching: Three-dimensional characterization and modeling|journal=International Journal of Coal Geology|date=August 2016|volume=165|pages=231\u2013242|doi=10.1016/j.coal.2016.08.024|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307626119}}</ref> for an application to the determination of permeabilities that match the existing permeability data), neural networks, regularization techniques including multi scale analysis;\n* reformulation of the least-squares objective function so as to make it smoother (see<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> for the inverse problem in the wave equations.)\n\n==== Computation of the gradient of the objective function ====\n\nInverse problems, especially in infinite dimension, may be large size, thus requiring important computing time. When the forward map is nonlinear, the computational difficulties increase and minimizing the objective function can be difficult. Contrary to the linear situation, an explicit use of the Hessian matrix for solving the normal equations does not make sense here : the Hessian matrix varies with models. Much more effective is the evaluation of the gradient of the objective function for some models. Important computational effort can be saved when we can avoid the very heavy computation of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] ( often called \"[[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]]s\")  : the adjoint state method, proposed by Chavent and Lions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |title=Identification de coefficients r\u00e9partis dans les \u00e9quations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles |date=1971 |publisher=Th\u00e8se d'Etat |location=Universit\u00e9 Paris 6}}</ref> is aimed to avoid this very heavy computation.

In total, the DSI consists of about 450 people, both police officers and military personnel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Andringa |first1=Remco |title=Anti-terreurteams rijden permanent rond |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2071727-anti-terreurteams-rijden-permanent-rond.html |publisher=NOS |date=27 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe unit is unique in that it is a mixed unit consisting of both law enforcement and military personnel. Its main tasks are neutralizing terror threats, arresting armed suspects. Since 2013, the regular '''ATs''' ({{lang|nl|'''Arrestatieteams'''}}; {{lang-en|'''Arrest Teams'''}}) are part of the DSI as well.\n\n==History==\n\nThe DSI was established in 2006 in order to improve the joint deployments of the several police tactical units. Points of improvement became apparent after the problematic siege of a house in [[The Hague]] which was part of operations aimed at the arrest of terrorists belonging to the [[Hofstad Network]]. \n\nTo prevent these situations, the DSI unified law enforcement and military tasks in one organisation. The goal of this unification was to increase both interoperability and efficiency, and to combine the specialisations of both the police and the military. Following a confidential experts report, the [[Second Balkenende cabinet]] decided to implement a revision of the ''Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid'', the spearhead [[counter-terrorism]] unit at the time. The DSI unofficially commenced operations in 2005, the formal establishment took place on 1 July 2006, and was at that time part of the ''[[Korps landelijke politiediensten|KLPD]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nieuwe antiterreureenheid gepresenteerd |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nieuwe-antiterreureenheid-gepresenteerd~b2133bc0/ |agency=ANP |publisher=De Volkskrant |date=14 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a report surfaced that found that the DSI suffered from personnel shortages. This shortage was partly caused by a relatively large outflow of personnel. Personnel leaving the service often stated that a lack of deployments was the main reason for their departure. The government commission tasked with evaluating the effectiveness, however, found that the general consenus was that the service functioned in a good manner. The commission was enthusiastic about the cooperation among police and military personnel.\n\nFollowing the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack]] in 2015, the need arose for a flexible and mobile teams of special forces in [[the Netherlands]]. Subsequently, the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) were established. The RRTs consist of both police and military personnel. Additionally, the DSI received a considerable and structural budget increase.\n\nWith the establishment of the National Police Corps in 2013 the regular Arrest Teams were placed under the command of the DSI.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timmer |first1=Jaap |title=Krijgsmacht en politietaken |journal=Justiti\u00eble verkenningen |date=2018 |pages=77 |url=https://www.wodc.nl/binaries/JV201803_Volledige%20tekst_tcm28-335093.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Selection and training ==\n[[File:Dienst_speciale_interventies_m_squadron.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|DSI (AI, AE&OO and M-Squadron operators during training in [[Arkansas]], [[United States]].]]\n\nThe first courses for the Arrest Teams took place in 1978 under the command of the ''Rijkspolitie''. In 1979, the ministers of Justice and the minister of the Interior, established four Arrest Teams under the command of the national police (''Rijkspolitie''), and six Arrest Teams under the command of the municipal police forces (''Gemeentepolitie'') of the six largest cities.  in  (local police forces). \n\nSince the reorganisation of the Dutch police in 1994, all aspiring AT personnel attend the same basic training at the police academy. The training takes place in several locations throughout the country and takes a total of twenty weeks in which aspiring AT-operators are trained extensively in shooting, house clearing, de-escalation and an extensive specialised driving course. Marines of [[M-Squadron]] that are detached to Unit Intervention undergo the complete AT-training as well. Because of the strict psychological, social and physical selection of the operators, the intense course, frequent training, and high-quality equipment, DSI personnel are well equipped to deploy in highly challenging situations. The extensive training enables the operators to arrest suspects with as little violence as possible.\n\nAdditionally, all DSI operators develop a specialism. Individual AT operators are free to pass on their specialism of choice to their superiors. Personnel can choose the following specialisms:\n* [[Police diving|Diving]]: divers of the DSI are regularly deployed to search for and secure evidence (for example firearms) and to assist forensic experts.\n* High altitude operations: high altitude operators are trained to operate on high altitudes for counter-terrorism, arrest and rescue operations.\n* [[Combat medic|Medic]]: medics are trained and responsible for providing first aid and frontline trauma care during operations.\n* Demolition expert: demolition expert are specialised in the use of explosives. Explosives are regularly used during operations for [[door breaching]].\n* Motorcyclist: motorcyclists within the DSI are trained to operate on and from unmarked police motorcycles. Motorcycles are used by the DSI to arrest suspects moving on foot and for interventions at difficultlt accessible locations.\n* Firearm instructor: firearm instructors provide firearm training and instructions for the several weapon systems in use within the DSI. \n* K-9 handler: the DSI has multiple [[police dogs]] at their disposal. These dogs are used for both arrests and reconnaissances.

In total, the DSI consists of about 450 people, both police officers and military personnel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Andringa |first1=Remco |title=Anti-terreurteams rijden permanent rond |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2071727-anti-terreurteams-rijden-permanent-rond.html |publisher=NOS |date=27 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe unit is unique in that it is a mixed unit consisting of both law enforcement and military personnel. Its main tasks are neutralizing terror threats, arresting armed suspects. Since 2013, the regular '''ATs''' ({{lang|nl|'''Arrestatieteams'''}}; {{lang-en|'''Arrest Teams'''}}) are part of the DSI as well.\n\n==History==\n\nThe DSI was established in 2006 in order to improve the joint deployments of the several police tactical units. Points of improvement became apparent after the problematic siege of a house in [[The Hague]] which was part of operations aimed at the arrest of terrorists belonging to the [[Hofstad Network]]. \n\nTo prevent these situations, the DSI unified law enforcement and military tasks in one organisation. The goal of this unification was to increase both interoperability and efficiency, and to combine the specialisations of both the police and the military. Following a confidential experts report, the [[Second Balkenende cabinet]] decided to implement a revision of the ''Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid'', the spearhead [[counter-terrorism]] unit at the time. The DSI unofficially commenced operations in 2005, the formal establishment took place on 1 July 2006, and was at that time part of the ''[[Korps landelijke politiediensten|KLPD]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nieuwe antiterreureenheid gepresenteerd |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nieuwe-antiterreureenheid-gepresenteerd~b2133bc0/ |agency=ANP |publisher=De Volkskrant |date=14 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a report surfaced that found that the DSI suffered from personnel shortages. This shortage was partly caused by a relatively large outflow of personnel. Personnel leaving the service often stated that a lack of deployments was the main reason for their departure. The government commission tasked with evaluating the effectiveness, however, found that the general consenus was that the service functioned in a good manner. The commission was enthusiastic about the cooperation among police and military personnel.\n\nFollowing the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack]] in 2015, the need arose for a flexible and mobile teams of special forces in [[the Netherlands]]. Subsequently, the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) were established. The RRTs consist of both police and military personnel. Additionally, the DSI received a considerable and structural budget increase.\n\nWith the establishment of the National Police Corps in 2013 the regular Arrest Teams were placed under the command of the DSI.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timmer |first1=Jaap |title=Krijgsmacht en politietaken |journal=Justiti\u00eble verkenningen |date=2018 |pages=77 |url=https://www.wodc.nl/binaries/JV201803_Volledige%20tekst_tcm28-335093.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Selection and training ==\n[[File:Dienst_speciale_interventies_m_squadron.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|DSI (AI, AE&OO and M-Squadron operators during training in [[Arkansas]], [[United States]].]]\n\nThe first courses for the Arrest Teams took place in 1978 under the command of the ''Rijkspolitie''. In 1979, the ministers of Justice and the minister of the Interior, established four Arrest Teams under the command of the national police (''Rijkspolitie''), and six Arrest Teams under the command of the municipal police forces (''Gemeentepolitie'') of the six largest cities.  in  (local police forces). \n\nSince the reorganisation of the Dutch police in 1994, all aspiring AT personnel attend the same basic training at the police academy. The training takes place in several locations throughout the country and takes a total of twenty weeks in which aspiring AT-operators are trained extensively in shooting, house clearing, de-escalation and an extensive specialised driving course. Marines of [[M-Squadron]] that are detached to Unit Intervention undergo the complete AT-training as well. Because of the strict psychological, social and physical selection of the operators, the intense course, frequent training, and high-quality equipment, DSI personnel are well equipped to deploy in highly challenging situations. The extensive training enables the operators to arrest suspects with as little violence as possible.\n\nAdditionally, all DSI operators develop a specialism. Individual AT operators are free to pass on their specialism of choice to their superiors. Personnel can choose the following specialisms:\n* [[Police diving|Diving]]: divers of the DSI are regularly deployed to search for and secure evidence (for example firearms) and to assist forensic experts.\n* High altitude operations: high altitude operators are trained to operate on high altitudes for counter-terrorism, arrest and rescue operations.\n* [[Combat medic|Medic]]: medics are trained and responsible for providing first aid and frontline trauma care during operations.\n* Demolition expert: demolition expert are specialised in the use of explosives. Explosives are regularly used during operations for [[door breaching]].\n* Motorcyclist: motorcyclists within the DSI are trained to operate on and from unmarked police motorcycles. Motorcycles are used by the DSI to arrest suspects moving on foot and for interventions at difficultlt accessible locations.\n* Firearm instructor: firearm instructors provide firearm training and instructions for the several weapon systems in use within the DSI. \n* K-9 handler: the DSI has multiple [[police dogs]] at their disposal. These dogs are used for both arrests and reconnaissances. DSI dogs often stay with their respective handlers after their working life.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe DSI consist of four units:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timmer |first1=Jaap |title=Krijgsmacht en politietaken |journal=Justiti\u00eble verkenningen |date=2018 |pages=79 |url=https://www.wodc.nl/binaries/JV201803_Volledige%20tekst_tcm28-335093.pdf}}</ref>\n* Unit Arrest Teams ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeling Arrestatie- en Ondersteuningteams, A-AOT''): the Arrest Teams are mainly deployed for the arrest of armed suspects and other life threatening situations.

Between 1932 and 1939 he worked as an industrial manager: as a foreman, master, chief of shop, and then assistant to the chief engineer of a factory in [[Leningrad]], and then from 1937 as director of a nonferrous metals factory in the [[Ivanovo]] region.\n\n==Political career==\n\nLomako joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1925. In 1939 he was made an assistant to the [[People's Commissar]] (Narkom) for Nonferrous Metallurgy, and in 1940 he was promoted to the post of Narkom.

In particular, he was responsible for managing the mass evacuation of Soviet industry to the Ural mountains region.\n\n===Post-War===\n\nFollowing the Second World War, Lomako remained Narkom and subsequently [[Minister for Nonferrous Metallurgy]] until 1948. Between 1948 and 1950, he served as Deputy Minister for the [[Iron]] and [[Steel]] Industry. He was returned to original portfolio as a Minister in 1950, and then made Deputy Minister for Iron and Steel once again in 1951, before serving for a third time as Minister for Nonferrous Metallurgy between 1954 and 1957.\n\nIn 1957 Lomako left [[Sovmin]], becoming Chairman of the [[Krasnoyarsk]] People's Economic Council (Sovnarkhoz), a position he held until 1961.\n\n===Party career===\n\nLomako was a candidate member of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] at the [[19th Congress of the CPSU|19th]] and [[20th Congress of the CPSU|20th Congresses of the CPSU]].

{"title_page": "Solubility equilibrium", "text_new": "'''Solubility equilibrium''' is a type of [[dynamic equilibrium]] that exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol/[[litre|L]]) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg/ml. Solubility is temperature-dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\", which may be a tiny crystal of the solute or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria:\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See {{slink|Equilibrium chemistry|Equilibrium constant}} for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature-dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Yi-Ling |last2=Ilevbare |first2=Grace A. |last3=Van Eerdenbrugh |first3=Bernard |last4=Box |first4=Karl J. |last5=Sanchez-Felix |first5=Manuel Vincente |last6=Taylor |first6=Lynne S. |date=2012-05-12 |title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=2738\u20132753 |doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8 |pmid=22580905 |issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dengale |first=Swapnil Jayant |last2=Grohganz |first2=Holger |last3=Rades |first3=Thomas |last4=L\u00f6bmann |first4=Korbinian |date=May 2016 |title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=100 |pages=116\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009 |pmid=26805787 |issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle-size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility increases with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy.

Section 2.14.</ref> ([[salting in]] and [[salting out]]) refers to the fact that the presence of a salt without [[common ion effect|ion in common]] with the solute has an effect on the [[ionic strength]] of the solution and hence on [[activity coefficient]]s, so that the equilibrium constant, expressed as a concentration quotient, changes.\n\n=== Temperature effect ===\n[[File:SolubilityVsTemperature.png|thumb|300px]]\n\nSolubility is sensitive to changes in [[temperature]]. For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In accordance with [[Le Chatelier's principle]], when the dissolution process is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature. This effect is the basis for the process of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], which can be used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is [[exothermic]] (heat is released), solubility decreases with rising temperature.<ref name=\"pauling450\">{{cite book |author-link=Linus Pauling |last=Pauling |first= Linus |title=General Chemistry |publisher= Dover Publishing |date= 1970 |page=450}}</ref> \n[[Sodium sulfate]] shows increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a decreasing solubility at higher temperature.<ref>{{cite book |first = W.\u00a0F. |last = Linke |first2=A. |last2= Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds |edition = 4th |publisher = Van Nostrand |year = 1965 |isbn = 0-8412-0097-1}}</ref> This is because the solid phase is the decahydrate ({{Chem|Na|2|S|O|4|\u00b710H|2|O}}) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that temperature.\n\nThe dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for low-solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the enthalpy of melting \u0394<sub>m</sub>''H'' and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2},</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}</math> is the [[partial molar enthalpy]] of the solute at infinite dilution, and <math> H_{i,\\text{cr}}</math> is the enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal.<ref> [[Kenneth Denbigh]], ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', 1957, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThis differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give<ref>[[Peter Atkins]], ''Physical Chemistry'', p. 153 (8th edition).</ref>:\n\n: <math>ln x_i = \\frac{\\Delta_\\text{m} H_i}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right).</math>\n\nFor nonideal solutions, activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{H_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2}.</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\n===Pressure effect===\nFor condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice.

M. |last=Gutman |title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an ''organic solid'' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants),\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}}{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(s)}\\}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}.</math>\n\nThe activity of a substance A in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration [A] and an [[activity coefficient]] ''\u03b3''. When <math>K^\\ominus</math> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant\n\n: <math chem>K_\\text{s} = [\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}]</math>\n\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution, so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol/L at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol/L (540&nbsp;g/L). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n'''Ionic compounds''' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\n:<math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\right\\}}\n=\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}]= [\\ce{Ag+}]^2= [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.\\,</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte\n:AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n:A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup> \nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup>[B]<sup>''q''</sup>\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''{{sfrac|q|p}}'' times the concentration of A. \n:[B] = ''{{sfrac|q|p}}''[A]\nTherefore\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q =\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q[\\ce{A}]^{p+q}</math>\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}</math>\nThe solubility, ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A].

The smaller the value, or the more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.\n\nSome salts are not fully dissociated in solution. Examples include [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO<sub>4</sub>]], famously discovered by [[Manfred Eigen]] to be present in [[seawater]] as both an [[inner sphere complex]] and an [[ion association|outer sphere complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1967/eigen-lecture.pdf |first=Manfred |last=Eigen|author-link=Manfred Eigen |title=Nobel lecture|date=1967|website=Nobel Prize}}</ref> The solubility of such salts is calculated by the method outlined in [[#Dissolution with reaction|dissolution with reaction]].\n\n=== Hydroxides ===\nFor hydroxides solubility products are often given in a modified form, ''K''*<sub>sp</sub>, using hydrogen ion concentration in place of hydroxide ion concentration.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite book|last=Baes |first1=C.

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction. In [[gravimetric analysis]] for silver, the reduction in solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure \"complete\" precipitation of AgCl.\n\n== Dissolution with reaction ==\n[[File:Silver Chloride dissolution.png|thumb|180px| When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag<sup>+</sup> is formed]]\nA typical reaction with dissolution involves a [[weak base]], B, dissolving in an acidic aqueous solution.\n: B(s) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup> (aq)\nThis reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |title=Potential Of Solubility In Drug Discovery And development |last=Payghan |first=Santosh |year=2008 |publisher=Pharminfo.net |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330171700/http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Dissolution of weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important. \n:H<sub>''n''</sub>A(s) + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>A<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so solubility depends on pH and the [[acid dissociation constant]] of the solute. The term \"intrinsic solubility\" is used to describe the solubility of the un-ionized form in the absence of acid or alkali.\n\nLeaching of aluminium salts from rocks and soil by [[acid rain]] is another example of dissolution with reaction: [[alumino-silicate]]s are bases which react with the acid to form soluble species, such as Al<sup>3+</sup>(aq).\n\nFormation of a chemical [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] may also change solubility.

This is because both precipitation and dissolution reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J.

In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility.

The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol/[[litre|L]]) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg/ml. Solubility is temperature-dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\", which may be a tiny crystal of the solute or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria:\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See {{slink|Equilibrium chemistry|Equilibrium constant}} for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature-dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Yi-Ling |last2=Ilevbare |first2=Grace A. |last3=Van Eerdenbrugh |first3=Bernard |last4=Box |first4=Karl J. |last5=Sanchez-Felix |first5=Manuel Vincente |last6=Taylor |first6=Lynne S. |date=2012-05-12 |title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=2738\u20132753 |doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8 |pmid=22580905 |issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dengale |first=Swapnil Jayant |last2=Grohganz |first2=Holger |last3=Rades |first3=Thomas |last4=L\u00f6bmann |first4=Korbinian |date=May 2016 |title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=100 |pages=116\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009 |pmid=26805787 |issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle-size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility increases with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small, unless particles become very small, typically smaller than 1&nbsp;\u03bcm. The effect of the particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:\n\n: <math>\\log(^*K_A) = \\log(^*K_{A \\to 0}) + \\frac{\\gamma A_\\text{m}}{3.454\\,RT},</math>\n\nwhere *''K<sub>A</sub>'' is the solubility constant for the solute particles with the molar surface area ''A'', *''K''<sub>''A''\u21920</sub> is the solubility constant for substance with molar surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), ''\u03b3'' is the [[surface tension]] of the solute particle in the solvent, ''A''<sub>m</sub> is the molar surface area of the solute (in m<sup>2</sup>/mol), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]].<ref name=hefter>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hefter |editor1-first=G.

Section 2.14.</ref> ([[salting in]] and [[salting out]]) refers to the fact that the presence of a salt without [[common ion effect|ion in common]] with the solute has an effect on the [[ionic strength]] of the solution and hence on [[activity coefficient]]s, so that the equilibrium constant, expressed as a concentration quotient, changes.\n\n=== Temperature effect ===\n[[File:SolubilityVsTemperature.png|thumb|300px]]\n\nSolubility is sensitive to changes in [[temperature]]. For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In accordance with [[Le Chatelier's principle]], when the dissolution process is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature. This effect is the basis for the process of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], which can be used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is [[exothermic]] (heat is released), solubility decreases with rising temperature.<ref name=\"pauling450\">{{cite book |author-link=Linus Pauling |last=Pauling |first= Linus |title=General Chemistry |publisher= Dover Publishing |date= 1970 |page=450}}</ref> \n[[Sodium sulfate]] shows increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a decreasing solubility at higher temperature.<ref>{{cite book |first = W.\u00a0F. |last = Linke |first2=A. |last2= Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds |edition = 4th |publisher = Van Nostrand |year = 1965 |isbn = 0-8412-0097-1}}</ref> This is because the solid phase is the decahydrate ({{Chem|Na|2|S|O|4|\u00b710H|2|O}}) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that temperature.\n\nThe dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for low-solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the enthalpy of melting \u0394<sub>m</sub>''H'' and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2},</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}</math> is the [[partial molar enthalpy]] of the solute at infinite dilution, and <math> H_{i,\\text{cr}}</math> is the enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal.<ref> [[Kenneth Denbigh]], ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', 1957, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThis differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give<ref>[[Peter Atkins]], ''Physical Chemistry'', p. 153 (8th edition).</ref>:\n\n: <math>ln x_i = \\frac{\\Delta_\\text{m} H_i}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right).</math>\n\nFor nonideal solutions, activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{H_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2}.</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\n===Pressure effect===\nFor condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice.

M. |last=Gutman |title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an '''organic solid''' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n:C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants):\n\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left \\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(s)}\\right\\}}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}</math>\nThe activity of a substance, A, in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration, [A], and an [[activity coefficient]], ''\u03b3''. When ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant, ''K''<sub>s</sub>,\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{s} = \\left[\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right]\\,</math>\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by the presence of any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> (540&nbsp;g/l). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n'''Ionic compounds''' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\n:<math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\right\\}}\n=\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}]= [\\ce{Ag+}]^2= [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.\\,</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte\n:AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n:A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup> \nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup>[B]<sup>''q''</sup>\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''{{sfrac|q|p}}'' times the concentration of A. \n:[B] = ''{{sfrac|q|p}}''[A]\nTherefore\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q =\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q[\\ce{A}]^{p+q}</math>\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}</math>\nThe solubility, ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A].

Thus, for calcium sulfate, {{math|1=''K''<sub>sp</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|4.93|e=-5}}}}, {{math|1=log&nbsp;''K''<sub>sp</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22124.32}}. The smaller the value, or the more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.\n\nSome salts are not fully dissociated in solution. Examples include [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO<sub>4</sub>]], famously discovered by [[Manfred Eigen]] to be present in [[seawater]] as both an [[inner sphere complex]] and an [[ion association|outer sphere complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1967/eigen-lecture.pdf |first=Manfred |last=Eigen|author-link=Manfred Eigen |title=Nobel lecture|date=1967|website=Nobel Prize}}</ref> The solubility of such salts is calculated by the method outlined in [[#Dissolution with reaction|dissolution with reaction]].\n\n=== Hydroxides ===\nFor hydroxides solubility products are often given in a modified form, ''K''*<sub>sp</sub>, using hydrogen ion concentration in place of hydroxide ion concentration.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite book|last=Baes |first1=C.

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction. In [[gravimetric analysis]] for silver, the reduction in solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure \"complete\" precipitation of AgCl.\n\n== Dissolution with reaction ==\n[[File:Silver Chloride dissolution.png|thumb|180px| When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag<sup>+</sup> is formed]]\nA typical reaction with dissolution involves a [[weak base]], B, dissolving in an acidic aqueous solution.\n: B(s) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup> (aq)\nThis reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |title=Potential Of Solubility In Drug Discovery And development |last=Payghan |first=Santosh |year=2008 |publisher=Pharminfo.net |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330171700/http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Dissolution of weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important. \n:H<sub>''n''</sub>A(s) + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>A<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so solubility depends on pH and the [[acid dissociation constant]] of the solute. The term \"intrinsic solubility\" is used to describe the solubility of the un-ionized form in the absence of acid or alkali.\n\nLeaching of aluminium salts from rocks and soil by [[acid rain]] is another example of dissolution with reaction: [[alumino-silicate]]s are bases which react with the acid to form soluble species, such as Al<sup>3+</sup>(aq).\n\nFormation of a chemical [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] may also change solubility.

This is because both precipitation and dissolution reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J.

In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}} Chapter 11: Gravimetric analysis</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic methods ===\nSolubility values of organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of pharmaceutical interest may be obtained by a process called \"Chasing equilibrium solubility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stuart|first=M.|last2=Box|first2=K. |year=2005|title=Chasing Equilibrium: Measuring the Intrinsic Solubility of Weak Acids and Bases|journal=Anal.
