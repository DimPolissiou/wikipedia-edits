The library is visited by more than 6,500 users per day, and circulates almost one million books annually.\n\nGifts from Mamdouha S.

On the north side, on even floors, are large, double-height study rooms featuring floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Washington Square Park.\n\n==Notable events==\n===Suicides===\nIn late 2003, the library was the site of two suicides. In separate incidents, students jumped from the open-air crosswalks inside the library and fell to the [[stereoscopy|stereogram]]-patterned marble floor below.\n\nAfter the second suicide, the university installed [[Plexiglas]] barricades on each level and along the stairways to prevent further jumping. In 2009, a third student jumped to his death from the tenth floor, apparently scaling the plexiglas barricade.<ref>Schapiro, Rich; Parascandola, Rocco; Siemaszko, Corky (November 3, 2009).

An added twist in this season is that they are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated. The original cast from this and past seasons do not compete in the next season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', as there is a new cast.

There are 30 songs in total, and every episode takes place in a different location.\n\nAs the contestants are eliminated, they take the \"Drop of Shame\"<ref name=\"newsarama\"/> by parachuting out of the plane in which the elimination ceremonies take place.

Midway through the season, Blaineley was brought on to compete, bringing the total number of contestants to 18, but was quickly eliminated.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|+List of ''Total Drama World Tour'' contestants\n!Contestant\n!Original team\n!Merge\n!Finish\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''Duncan''<br>\n|{{N/A}}\n| style=\"background:darkgrey;\" rowspan=\"11\"|\n|{{sort|6|Quit{{efn|Duncan refused to follow Chris' orders to sing and quit the game.}}<br />''Returned to game''}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''Ezekiel'''<br>The Homeschooled Guy<br>\n|{{stribe|pagong|Team Victory}}\n|{{sort|18|18th place}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''Harold'''<br>The Dweeb<br>\n|{{stribe|pagong|Team Victory}}\n|{{sort|6|Quit{{efn|DJ had the most votes, but Harold left the competition in order to restore his \"honor\" to his teammates after being self-absorbed in the last challenge.}}<br />17th place}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''Bridgette'''<br>The Surfer Girl<br>\n|{{stribe|pagong|Team Victory}}\n|{{sort|18|16th place}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''Leshawna'''<br>The Sister With 'Tude<br>\n|{{stribe|pagong|Team Victory}}\n|{{sort|18|15th place}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''Lindsay'''<br>The Dumb Princess<br>\n|{{stribe|pagong|Team Victory}}\n|{{sort|18|14th place}}{{efn|Due to Lindsay and DJ being the only two members left on Team Victory, they had to go into a tiebreaker.

Despite his intentions, he ends up being voted off first once again, but manages to grab hold of the wings and hide on the plane cargo to secretly stay in the competition. Over time, this has a drastic effect on his humanity and sanity, greatly altering his physical appearance into a green, clawed, bald, crazy, and deformed creature who is no longer capable of speaking and attacks anybody he considers a threat.\n|-\n| {{va|Gwen}}\n| [[Megan Fahlenbock]]\n| The Goth\n| Gwen is a goth girl whose interests lie in art and astronomy.

Despite this, Heather remains a strong enough competitor to make it to the Finale to compete against Alejandro.\n|-\n| {{va|Izzy}}\n| [[Katie Crown]]\n| The Psycho Hose Beast\n| Izzy is seen as one of the show's craziest contestants. She is fun but hard to handle and to the other contestants, more trouble than she is worth. Izzy has extraordinary athletic and fighting abilities, and also sticks herself to the wild environment. She is forced to withdraw early in the season due to a head injury causing her to become highly intelligent, which also led her to break up with Owen. In one of the Aftermaths, another head injury turned Izzy back to her former self.\n|-\n| {{va|Leshawna}}\n| Novie Edwards\n| The Sister With 'Tude\n| Leshawna is loyal and sassy, yet also can be affectionate and caring.

However, she is not one to be messed with, and will not hold back on someone who has wronged her.\n|-\n| {{va|Lindsay}}\n| [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]\n| The Dumb Princess\n| Lindsay is described as being beautiful, but not vain.

Owen's three biggest loves are eating, having a good time and passing a large amount of gas. Among his peers, he is arguably the most popular contestant of all time for his cheerful ways, optimistic viewpoints no matter what the situation is, and ability to see the best in other people. He annoys Alejandro by continuously calling him \"Al\" (Which Alejandro hates because his older brother calls him that), and becomes wary of his activities after Noah is eliminated.\n|-\n| {{va|Sierra}}\n| [[Annick Obonsawin]]\n| The Obsessive Uber-Fan\n| Sierra is the show's biggest fan and blogger and one of the two newcomers to ''World Tour''.

Keith Oliver and Chad Hicks directed this new season while two new voice actors, [[Marco Grazzini]] and [[Annick Obonsawin]] had to be hired if they wanted to voice the two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra. The season's title was later changed to the current title, ''Total Drama World Tour'' in 2010 upon the airing of Celebrity Manhunt's Total Drama Action Reunion Special due to the singing no longer being the main focus for this season.\n\n===Episode finale variations===\nThe show's producers create two alternate endings for the final episode, such that the winner seen in one country's broadcasts is the runner-up in other countries (and vice versa) where the show airs. Heather was shown as the first winner when Australia aired the season for the first time worldwide.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Heather was also depicted as the winner in airings from Bulgaria, Brazil, France, Israel, Italy, Latin America, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, Spain (including Catalonia), and in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Canada then aired Alejandro as the winner, which was later aired in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, and in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards and accolades===\n''Total Drama World Tour'' won numerous awards in 2011, from such outlets as the ToonZone Awards and the KidScreen Awards. At the ToonZone Awards, it won \"Best Foreign Series,\" \"Best Music Score on a TV Series,\" and \"Best Voice Actress\" for Annick Obonsawin. It was additionally nominated for \"Best Original Song\" for ''Oh My Izzy'' (sung by Scott McCord and Megan Fahlenbock), and \"Best Voice Actor\" for Carter Hayden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/toonzone-awards-2011-results.5198401/|title=Toonzone Awards 2011 - Results!|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> In the 2011 KidScreen Awards, the season won \"Best Animated Series,\" \"Best Voice Talent,\" and \"Best Tweens/Teens Program.\"<ref>https://www.licensing.org/press-release/kidscreen-awards-2011-winners-announced/</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nDespite the many accolades and the enormous critical acclaim, some events of this season were severely criticized, such as the under-use of characters who had smaller roles in the preceding seasons, and the overuse of characters who had already won a preceding season or, at the very least, made it far into them. Other aspects of the season that had a negative reception were Ezekiel being turned into a feral monster, the constant losing streak of Team Victory and the love triangle between Duncan, Courtney and Gwen. The love triangle was eventually addressed in a video with the show's creators on [[Christian Potenza]]'s [[YouTube]] channel, revealing that the breaking up of Duncan and Courtney was actually a network request, rather than a decision on the creator's part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aonKu98yPQg|title=Behind the DRAMA part 2|first=|last=SwitchBoardNetwork|date=29 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> ''Total Drama World Tour'' currently holds a 7.8 on [[Metacritic]], which indicates \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/total-drama-island/season-3|title=Total Drama Island|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===DVD releases===\n[[Australia]] is the only country that released ''Total Drama World Tour'' on home video, which was released on a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]] DVD.

An added twist in this season is that they are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated. The original cast from this and past seasons do not compete in the next season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', as there is a new cast. However, nine of these original contestants each have a cameo in the next season, while seven of them return to compete again in the fifth season, ''[[Total Drama All-Stars]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/mipcom-news-with-tom-mcgillis/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405050531/http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/mipcom-news-with-tom-mcgillis/ |archivedate=2014-04-05 }}</ref> This series is rated [[TV-PG]]-D in the United States and Australia.\n\nA spin-off series based on this season, ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race|The Ridonculous Race]]'', premiered in September 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nAs with the previous seasons, fifteen returning contestants and three new ones (Alejandro, Sierra, and Blaineley) partake in an elimination-based competition for the grand prize of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1,000,000, led by series host Chris McLean ([[Christian Potenza]]).\n\nIn this season, contestants are taken around the world throughout international based challenges and are required to break into song whenever Chris rings a special chime, or face instant elimination. There are 30 songs in total, and every episode takes place in a different location.\n\nAs the contestants are eliminated, they take the \"Drop of Shame\"<ref name=\"newsarama\"/> by parachuting out of the plane in which the elimination ceremonies take place. When eliminated, they lose the chance at the million dollars (though such an elimination may not be permanent) and are forced to be sent home.<ref name=\"newsarama\">{{cite web|title=Animated Shorts 596: Tom McGillis and Fresh TV|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/080926-Animated-Shorts.html|date=2008-06-26|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe winner of ''Total Drama World Tour'' is Alejandro in Canada, while Heather is the runner-up. However, in the American version and iTunes version, Heather is the winner. Beth, Eva, Geoff, Justin, Katie, Sadie, and Trent do not return to compete; instead, they appear on the aftermath special, sitting in the peanut gallery and on the last episode while cheering for the finalists, Alejandro and Heather.\n\nHowever, as stated multiple times in following seasons, there was never any clear winner, as the money was thrown into a volcano by Ezekiel, making the money burn into ashes. This is the second season (first being ''[[Total Drama Island]]'') in the series where no contestant wins anything.\n\nThis season's entire plot structure and elements is expanded into a related series called ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race]]'' which aired in 2015. This series also takes place around the world and also features eighteen competitors (teams) like ''Total Drama World Tour'', however whereas World Tour was still organized like ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''The Ridonculous Race'' was based on ''[[The Amazing Race]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pressroom.turner.com/us/cartoon-network/cartoon-network-approaches-upfront-unmatched-growth-across-all-screens|title=Pressroom|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Total Drama World Tour episodes}}\n''Total Drama World Tour'' is a Canadian animated television series which premiered on June 10, 2010 at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on Teletoon and it premiered on June 21, 2010 at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on Cartoon Network.

Keith Oliver and Chad Hicks directed this new season while two new voice actors, [[Marco Grazzini]] and [[Annick Obonsawin]] had to be hired if they wanted to voice the two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra. The season's title was later changed to the current title, ''Total Drama World Tour'' in 2010 upon the airing of Celebrity Manhunt's Total Drama Action Reunion Special due to the singing no longer being the main focus for this season.\n\n===Episode finale variations===\nThe show's producers create two alternate endings for the final episode, such that the winner seen in one country's broadcasts is the runner-up in other countries (and vice versa) where the show airs. Heather was shown as the first winner when Australia aired the season for the first time worldwide.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Heather was also depicted as the winner in airings from Bulgaria, Brazil, France, Israel, Italy, Latin America, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, Spain (including Catalonia), and in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Canada then aired Alejandro as the winner, which was later aired in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, and in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards and accolades===\n''Total Drama World Tour'' won numerous awards in 2011, from such outlets as the ToonZone Awards and the KidScreen Awards. At the ToonZone Awards, it won \"Best Foreign Series,\" \"Best Music Score on a TV Series,\" and \"Best Voice Actress\" for Annick Obonsawin. It was additionally nominated for \"Best Original Song\" for ''Oh My Izzy'' (sung by Scott McCord and Megan Fahlenbock), and \"Best Voice Actor\" for Carter Hayden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/toonzone-awards-2011-results.5198401/|title=Toonzone Awards 2011 - Results!|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> In the 2011 KidScreen Awards, the season won \"Best Animated Series,\" \"Best Voice Talent,\" and \"Best Tweens/Teens Program.\"<ref>https://www.licensing.org/press-release/kidscreen-awards-2011-winners-announced/</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nDespite the many accolades and the enormous critical acclaim, some events of this season were severely criticized, such as the under-use of characters who had smaller roles in the preceding seasons, and the overuse of characters who had already won a preceding season or, at the very least, made it far into them. Other aspects of the season that had a negative reception were Ezekiel being turned into a feral monster, the constant losing streak of Team Victory and the love triangle between Duncan, Courtney and Gwen. The love triangle was eventually addressed in a video with the show's creators on [[Christian Potenza]]'s [[YouTube]] channel, revealing that the breaking up of Duncan and Courtney was actually a network request, rather than a decision on the creator's part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aonKu98yPQg|title=Behind the DRAMA part 2|first=|last=SwitchBoardNetwork|date=29 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> ''Total Drama World Tour'' currently holds a 7.8 on [[Metacritic]], which indicates \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/total-drama-island/season-3|title=Total Drama Island|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===DVD releases===\n[[Australia]] is the only country that released ''Total Drama World Tour'' on home video, which was released on a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]] DVD.

For thirty years, he was the head of the Austrian-German congregation of [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in Rome and, until 1937, an influential representative of the [[Austrian Catholic Church]].\n\nIn his 1937 book, ''The Foundations of National Socialism'', Hudal praised [[Adolf Hitler]] and his policies and indirectly attacked Vatican policies. After [[World War II]], Hudal helped establish the [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|ratlines]], which allowed prominent [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] and other European [[Axis powers of World War II|former Axis]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[politics|political leaders]], among them accused war criminals, to escape [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] trials and [[denazification]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Education===\nAlois Hudal was born the son of a shoemaker on 31 May 1885 in [[Graz]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] and studied theology there from 1904 to 1908. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[priest]]hood in July 1908.\n\nHudal became a noted specialist on the liturgy, doctrine and spirituality of the Slavic-speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] while a parish priest in [[Kindberg]]. In 1911, he earned a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] degree at the [[University of Graz]]. He entered the [[Teutonic College of Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in Rome where he was a chaplain from 1911 to 1913 and attended courses in Old Testament at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]]. He earned his Doctor of Sacred Scripture degree with a dissertation on {{lang|de|Die religioesen und sittlichen Ideen des Spruchbuches}} (\"The Religious and Moral Ideas of the Book of Proverbs\"), published in 1914. He joined the faculty for Old Testament Studies at the [[University of Graz]] in 1914. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was a military chaplain. In 1917, he published a book of his sermons to the soldiers, ''Soldatenpredigten'', in which he expressed the idea that \"loyalty to the flag is loyalty to God\", though also warning against \"national chauvinism\".<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004|p=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, he was named Rector of the [[Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell'Anima]] (known simply \"Anima\") in Rome, a theological seminary for German and Austrian priests.<ref>See \"Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell\u2019Anima\" (in German) [[:de:Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell\u2019Anima]].</ref> In 1930, he was appointed a consultant to the [[Holy Office]] by Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]], its prefect.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=41}}, cited by {{harvp|Chenaux|2003}}.</ref>\n\n===Austria or Germany?===\n[[Ludwig von Pastor]], an  Austrian diplomat, introduced Hudal to [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1922, and recommended Hudal's study of the ''Serbo-Croatian National Church'' to him.<ref>{{harvp|von Pastor|1950|p=744}}</ref> On 5 February 1923 he recommended Hudal for a position at the Anima, mainly because he was Austrian.

Before the rise of Nazism, he was already critical of parliamentary governance. His ideas were similar to the political and economic ideas of such fascist politicians as Dollfuss and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (Austria), [[Franz von Papen]] (Germany), and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] (Portugal). According to author Greg Whitlock, \"Hudal squarely fitted into a formula current at the time, the category of [[Clero-Fascism|Clerical-Fascism]].\"<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\">{{harvp|Whitlock|2003}}</ref>\n\nHudal was most concerned with the rise of the international Communist movement and worker parties in Austria. Fear of \"[[Bolshevism]]\" was his starting point, but this feeling turned into an aggressive political doctrine towards Russia: \"Essential to understanding Hudal's politics is his fear that Bolshevist military forces would invade Italy through Eastern Europe or the Balkans and would be unstoppable until they destroyed the Church. Like many within the Church, he embraced the bulwark theory, which placed hope in a strong German-Austrian military shield to protect Rome. This protection involved a pre-emptive attack on communism, Hudal believed, and so he felt an urgent need for a Christian army from Central Europe to invade Russia and eliminate the Bolshevist threat to Rome\".<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\"/>\n\nHe had another reason to hope for a German-led defeat of Russia. His long-term goals were \"the reunification of Rome with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the conversion of the Balkans from the Serbian Orthodox Church to Catholicism\".<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\"/> He expected that the invasion of the Soviet Union by European forces would serve these aims. Since the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] had crushed the Russian Orthodox Church, Hudal and other Catholics saw an historic opportunity to help Russian Christians with aid \"and conversion\", ending the thousand-year [[East-West Schism]] that divided Christianity.<ref>{{harvp|Stehle|1981}}</ref>\n\n===\"Good\" and \"bad\" National Socialism===\nHudal is said to have received a Golden [[Nazi Party]] membership badge,<ref>Karlheinz Deschner, ''Ein Jahrhundert Heilsgeschichte'', vol. II, Leck, 1983, pp. 135, 139.</ref> but this is disputed. In Vienna in 1937, Hudal published a book entitled ''The Foundations of National Socialism'', with an [[imprimatur]] from Archbishop [[Theodor Innitzer]], in which he enthusiastically endorsed Hitler. Hudal sent Hitler a copy with a handwritten dedication praising him as \"the new [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] of Germany's greatness\".<ref>{{harvp|Klee|1991}}</ref>\n\nThe Nazis did not officially ban the book but did not allow it to circulate in Germany. After the end of [[World War II]], [[Franz von Papen]] declared that Hudal's book had \"very much impressed\" Hitler, and he blamed Hitler's  \"anti-Christian advisers\" for not allowing a German edition to circulate. \"All I could obtain was permission to print 2,000 copies, which Hitler wanted to distribute among leading Party members for a study of the problem\", von Papen claimed.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/06-17-46.htm ''Nuremberg Trials Proceedings'' (vol. 16, p. 285)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708200001/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/06-17-46.htm |date=2007-07-08 }}, yale.edu; accessed 14 January 2016.</ref>\n\nHudal criticized the works of several Nazi ideologues, like [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Ernst Bergmann (philosopher)|Ernst Bergmann]], who despised Christianity and considered it \"alien to Germanic genius\".<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004|p=51}}, citing E. Bergmann's ''Die deutsche Nationalkirche'' (The German National Church), Breslau, 1933.</ref> The condemnation by the Holy Office of Rosenberg's ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' in 1934 and, shortly thereafter, of Bergmann's ''The German National Church'' had been based on Hudal's assessment of those works.<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn his own 1937 book, Hudal proposed a reconciliation and a pragmatic compromise between Nazism and Christianity, leaving the education of youth to the churches, while leaving politics entirely to National Socialism. This had been the line followed by German Catholic politician and former Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen. In the autumn of 1934, Hudal had explained this strategy to Pius XI: the \"good\" ought to be isolated from the \"bad\" in [[National Socialism]]. The bad - Rosenberg, Bergmann, Himmler and others - according to Hudal represented the \"left wing\" of the Nazi party. The Nazi \"conservatives\", headed by Hitler in this interpretation, should be directed toward Rome, Christianized and used against the Communists and the Eastern danger.<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004|p=53}}, citing {{harvp|Hudal|1976}}.</ref> Hitler's book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was never put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] by Rome, as censors continually postponed and eventually terminated its examination, balking at taking him on directly.<ref>Heneghan, Tom.[http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&textID=3998&issueID=517 \"Secrets Behind The Forbidden Books\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630134829/http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&textID=3998&issueID=517 |date=2006-06-30 }}, americamagazine.org, 7 February 2005.</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Hudal had become influential in creating a proposed list of \"errors and heresies\" of the era, condemning several [[racism|racist]] errors of Nazi politicians, the [[Nuremberg laws]], and also condemning several statements taken directly from ''Mein Kampf''; this list was accepted by Pope Pius XI as an adequate condemnation, but he wanted an [[encyclical]] rather than a mere syllabus or list of errors.<ref>{{harvp|Wolf|2005|p=1ff}}</ref> Three years later, in June 1938, Pius ordered the American Jesuit [[John LaFarge Jr.]] to prepare an encyclical condemning [[antisemitism]], [[racism]] and the [[persecution of Jews]]. Together with fellow Jesuits Gustav Gundlach (Germany) and Gustave Desbuquois (France), LaFarge produced [[Humani generis unitas|a draft for an encyclical]] which was on Pius XI's desk when he died. It was never promulgated by Pius XII.<ref>Georges Passelecq, ''L'encyclique cach\u00e9e de Pie XI : une occasion manqu\u00e9e de l'Eglise face \u00e0 l'antis\u00e9mitisme'', Paris : \u00c9d. la D\u00e9couverte, 1995.</ref>\n\nRosenberg's reaction to Hudal's ideas was violent, and the circulation of the ''Foundations of National Socialism'' was restricted in Germany. \"We do not allow the fundaments of the Movement to be analyzed and criticized by a Roman Bishop\", said Rosenberg.<ref>Cited by {{harvp|Aarons|Loftus|1991|p=31}}.</ref> In 1935, even before he wrote the ''Foundations of National Socialism'' Hudal had said about Rosenberg: \"If National Socialism wants to replace Christianity by the notions of race and blood, we will have to face the greatest heresy of the twentieth century. It must be rejected by the Church as decisively as, if not more severely than [...] the [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]], with which it shares some errors. But Rosenberg's doctrine is more imbued with negation and creates, above all in the youth, a hatred against Christianity greater than that of [[Nietzsche]]\".<ref>A. Hudal, ''Das deutsche Volk und christliches Abendland'', p. 24, cited by {{harvp|Whitlock|2003}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the restrictions imposed on his book, and despite National Socialist restrictions against German [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[parishes]], and attempts by the Nazi government to forbid Catholic education at schools, going as far as banning the [[crucifix]] in schools and other public areas (the [[Oldenburg]] crucifix struggle of November 1936), and despite the Nazi dissolution and confiscation of Austrian monasteries and the official banning of Catholic newspapers and associations in Austria (\"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), Hudal remained close to some Nazi officials, as he was convinced that the Nazi new order would nevertheless prevail in Europe due to its \"force\".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nHudal was particularly close to von Papen, who as the Reich's ambassador in Vienna prepared the German-Austrian agreement of 11 July 1936, which some claim paved the way for the [[Anschluss]]. This agreement was backed by Hudal in the Austrian press, against the position of several Austrian Bishops.<ref>{{harvp|Chenaux|2003}}</ref>\n\n===Vatican reaction===\nWhen, in 1937, Hudal published his book on the foundations of National Socialism,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937}}</ref> Church authorities were upset because of his deviation from Church policy and teachings. Hudal, without mentioning names, had openly questioned the Vatican policy of [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]] towards National Socialism, which culminated in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', in which the Vatican openly attacked National Socialism. The 1937 Hudal book froze his steady rise in Rome and resulted in his leaving the city after the war. His publication like his two previous, ''{{lang|de|Rom, Christentum und deutsches Volk}}'' (1935) and ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Volk und christliches Abendland}}'' (1935) did not have an [[Imprimatur]] or ecclesiastical approval, which was another reason for the cooling of relations with the Vatican. Hudal had proposed a \"truly Christian National Socialism\": education and church affairs would be controlled by the Church, while political discourse would remain exclusively National Socialist.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=250}}</ref>\n\nThe Nazis had no intention of giving up education to the Church. Together - according to Hudal - Church and state in Germany would fight against Communism.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=17}}</ref> Hudal saw a direct link between Jews and Marxism,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|pp=86, 92}}</ref> lamenting their alleged dominance in academic occupations,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=87}}</ref> and supporting [[Racial segregation|segregation]] legislation against Jews in order to protect against foreign influence.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Break with the Vatican===\nHudal, previously a popular and influential guest in the Vatican, lived from 1938 on in isolation in the Anima College. This position he was forced to resign in 1952. Hudal's 1933 promotion to Bishop has been cited as evidence that he had close ties to members of the [[Roman Curia]], particularly Cardinal Merry del Val (who died in 1930), and Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pius XII, who had been Papal Nuncio in Germany. His close relationship with Pacelli and Pius XI stopped immediately after the publication of his book in 1937, which was seen as contradicting ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' and the 1933 [[Reichskonkordat]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Hudal during World War II===\nHudal's exile within Rome continued during World War II. He continued as pastoral head of the Anima Church and College but had no position in the Vatican and no access to Pope Pius XII or his senior staff. The French Jesuit historian, Pierre Blet, co-editor of ''Acts and Documents'', mentioned Hudal only once, stating that the pope's nephew Carlo Pacelli saw Hudal and after this meeting, Hudal wrote to the military governor of Rome, General [[Reiner Stahel|Stahel]], and urged him to suspend all actions against Jews. The Germans suspended the actions \"out of the consideration for the special character of Rome\".<ref>{{harvp|Blet|1997|p=216}}</ref>\n\nAccording to another author, however, the idea of Hudal's intervention came from the German ambassador himself, who asked the rector of the Anima to sign a letter to the military commander of Rome, General [[Reiner Stahel]], requesting that the arrests be halted, otherwise the pope would take a position in public against the arrests and the German occupiers.<ref name=\"Kurzman\">{{harvp|Kurzman|2007|pp=183\u201385}}</ref> Ambassador Weizs\u00e4cker, it was argued, had chosen this ruse because Hitler might have reacted against the Vatican and the Pope if it had been the German embassy conveying the warning, instead of the Nazi-friendly bishop.<ref name=\"Kurzman\"/> However, this account is seriously undermined by Hudal's claim in his Memories that it was the nephew of Pius XII, Carlo Pacelli, who came to see him and inspired the letter <ref>Hudal (1976), pp. 214-15</ref> and by Dr Rainer Decker's discovery among Hudal's papers in the Anima of the original typewritten draft of the letter sent to Stahel.<ref>Decker (2019), pp. 237-39</ref>  This draft, which is much longer than the excerpt from it sent to Berlin, contains Hudal's handwritten corrections, introductory greetings to Stahel recalling their mutual acquaintance Captain Diemert, and a final paragraph noting that, as had previously been discussed last March, Germany might need the good offices of the Vatican in the near future.<ref>Decker (2019), p. 254</ref>  These details could not have been known to Ambassador Weizs\u00e4cker or any of the other diplomats. And this leaves little doubt that the letter was written by Bishop Hudal himself and by no one else, and that it was initiated by a visit from Pius XII's nephew, Carlo Pacelli on the morning of 16 October 1943.\n\nDuring the war Hudal sheltered victims of the Nazis at Santa Maria dell'Anima, used by the Resistance. [[Brigadier general]] John Burns, a [[New Zealand]]er, gave a description of it when recalling his escape from an Italian POW-camp in 1944.<ref>Burns, John.

In his native Austria, his pro-Nazi book was now openly discussed and critiqued.

He viewed it as \"a charity to people in dire need, for persons without any guilt who are to be made scapegoats for the failures of an evil system.\"<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=22}}</ref> He used the services of the Austrian Office (''\u00d6sterreichisches Bureau'') in Rome, which had the necessary identity cards (\"Carta di riconoscimento\"), for migration mainly to [[Arab world|Arab]] and South American countries.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=34}}</ref> It is also alleged that the president of the International Red Cross [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]] and Cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]] were also involved in the \"ratlines\"<ref>[http://www.aish.com/jw/s/Nazi-Havens-in-South-America.html?s=rab Nazi Havens in South America accessed October 25,2018]</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether he was an official appointee of the Papal refugee organization [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]] (PCA) ('Pontifical Commission of Assistance') or whether he acted as [[de facto]] head of the Catholic Austrian community in Rome. He is credited with helping, networking and organising the escape of war criminals such as [[Franz Stangl]], commanding officer of [[Treblinka]]. Stangl told [[Gitta Sereny]]<ref>{{harvp|Sereny|1974}}</ref> that he went looking for Hudal in Rome as he had heard that the bishop was helping all Germans.

Against these allegations of the direct involvement of Pope Pius XII and his staff, there are some opposing testimonies and the denial by Vatican officials of any involvement of Pius XII himself.

In 1911, he earned a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] degree at the [[University of Graz]]. He entered the [[Teutonic College of Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in Rome where he was a chaplain from 1911 to 1913 and attended courses in Old Testament at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]].

He joined the faculty for Old Testament Studies at the [[University of Graz]] in 1914. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was a military chaplain.

Before the rise of Nazism, he was already critical of parliamentary governance. His ideas were similar to the political and economic ideas of such fascist politicians as Dollfuss and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (Austria), [[Franz von Papen]] (Germany), and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] (Portugal). According to author Greg Whitlock, \"Hudal squarely fitted into a formula current at the time, the category of [[Clero-Fascism|Clerical-Fascism]].\"<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\">{{harvp|Whitlock|2003}}</ref>\n\nHudal was most concerned with the rise of the international Communist movement and worker parties in Austria. Fear of \"[[Bolshevism]]\" was his starting point, but this feeling turned into an aggressive political doctrine towards Russia: \"Essential to understanding Hudal's politics is his fear that Bolshevist military forces would invade Italy through Eastern Europe or the Balkans and would be unstoppable until they destroyed the Church. Like many within the Church, he embraced the bulwark theory, which placed hope in a strong German-Austrian military shield to protect Rome. This protection involved a pre-emptive attack on communism, Hudal believed, and so he felt an urgent need for a Christian army from Central Europe to invade Russia and eliminate the Bolshevist threat to Rome\".<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\"/>\n\nHe had another reason to hope for a German-led defeat of Russia. His long-term goals were \"the reunification of Rome with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the conversion of the Balkans from the Serbian Orthodox Church to Catholicism\".<ref name=\"Whitlock2003\"/> He expected that the invasion of the Soviet Union by European forces would serve these aims. Since the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] had crushed the Russian Orthodox Church, Hudal and other Catholics saw an historic opportunity to help Russian Christians with aid \"and conversion\", ending the thousand-year [[East-West Schism]] that divided Christianity.<ref>{{harvp|Stehle|1981}}</ref>\n\n===\"Good\" and \"bad\" National Socialism===\nHudal is said to have received a Golden [[Nazi Party]] membership badge,<ref>Karlheinz Deschner, ''Ein Jahrhundert Heilsgeschichte'', vol. II, Leck, 1983, pp. 135, 139.</ref> but this is disputed. In Vienna in 1937, Hudal published a book entitled ''The Foundations of National Socialism'', with an [[imprimatur]] from Archbishop [[Theodor Innitzer]], in which he enthusiastically endorsed Hitler. Hudal sent Hitler a copy with a handwritten dedication praising him as \"the new [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] of Germany's greatness\".<ref>{{harvp|Klee|1991}}</ref>\n\nThe Nazis did not officially ban the book but did not allow it to circulate in Germany. After the end of [[World War II]], [[Franz von Papen]] declared that Hudal's book had \"very much impressed\" Hitler, and he blamed Hitler's  \"anti-Christian advisers\" for not allowing a German edition to circulate. \"All I could obtain was permission to print 2,000 copies, which Hitler wanted to distribute among leading Party members for a study of the problem\", von Papen claimed.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/06-17-46.htm ''Nuremberg Trials Proceedings'' (vol. 16, p. 285)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708200001/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/06-17-46.htm |date=2007-07-08 }}, yale.edu; accessed 14 January 2016.</ref>\n\nHudal criticized the works of several Nazi ideologues, like [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Ernst Bergmann (philosopher)|Ernst Bergmann]], who despised Christianity and considered it \"alien to Germanic genius\".<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004|p=51}}, citing E. Bergmann's ''Die deutsche Nationalkirche'' (The German National Church), Breslau, 1933.</ref> The condemnation by the Holy Office of Rosenberg's ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' in 1934 and, shortly thereafter, of Bergmann's ''The German National Church'' had been based on Hudal's assessment of those works.<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn his own 1937 book, Hudal proposed a reconciliation and a pragmatic compromise between Nazism and Christianity, leaving the education of youth to the churches, while leaving politics entirely to National Socialism. This had been the line followed by German Catholic politician and former Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen. In the autumn of 1934, Hudal had explained this strategy to Pius XI: the \"good\" ought to be isolated from the \"bad\" in [[National Socialism]]. The bad - Rosenberg, Bergmann, Himmler and others - according to Hudal represented the \"left wing\" of the Nazi party. The Nazi \"conservatives\", headed by Hitler in this interpretation, should be directed toward Rome, Christianized and used against the Communists and the Eastern danger.<ref>{{harvp|Godman|2004|p=53}}, citing {{harvp|Hudal|1976}}.</ref> Hitler's book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was never put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] by Rome, as censors continually postponed and eventually terminated its examination, balking at taking him on directly.<ref>Heneghan, Tom.[http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&textID=3998&issueID=517 \"Secrets Behind The Forbidden Books\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630134829/http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&textID=3998&issueID=517 |date=2006-06-30 }}, americamagazine.org, 7 February 2005.</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Hudal had become influential in creating a proposed list of \"errors and heresies\" of the era, condemning several [[racism|racist]] errors of Nazi politicians, the [[Nuremberg laws]], and also condemning several statements taken directly from ''Mein Kampf''; this list was accepted by Pope Pius XI as an adequate condemnation, but he wanted an [[encyclical]] rather than a mere syllabus or list of errors.<ref>{{harvp|Wolf|2005|p=1ff}}</ref> Three years later, in June 1938, Pius ordered the American Jesuit [[John LaFarge Jr.]] to prepare an encyclical condemning [[antisemitism]], [[racism]] and the [[persecution of Jews]]. Together with fellow Jesuits Gustav Gundlach (Germany) and Gustave Desbuquois (France), LaFarge produced [[Humani generis unitas|a draft for an encyclical]] which was on Pius XI's desk when he died. It was never promulgated by Pius XII.<ref>Georges Passelecq, ''L'encyclique cach\u00e9e de Pie XI : une occasion manqu\u00e9e de l'Eglise face \u00e0 l'antis\u00e9mitisme'', Paris : \u00c9d. la D\u00e9couverte, 1995.</ref>\n\nRosenberg's reaction to Hudal's ideas was violent, and the circulation of the ''Foundations of National Socialism'' was restricted in Germany. \"We do not allow the fundaments of the Movement to be analyzed and criticized by a Roman Bishop\", said Rosenberg.<ref>Cited by {{harvp|Aarons|Loftus|1991|p=31}}.</ref> In 1935, even before he wrote the ''Foundations of National Socialism'' Hudal had said about Rosenberg: \"If National Socialism wants to replace Christianity by the notions of race and blood, we will have to face the greatest heresy of the twentieth century. It must be rejected by the Church as decisively as, if not more severely than [...] the [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]], with which it shares some errors. But Rosenberg's doctrine is more imbued with negation and creates, above all in the youth, a hatred against Christianity greater than that of [[Nietzsche]]\".<ref>A. Hudal, ''Das deutsche Volk und christliches Abendland'', p. 24, cited by {{harvp|Whitlock|2003}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the restrictions imposed on his book, and despite National Socialist restrictions against German [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[parishes]], and attempts by the Nazi government to forbid Catholic education at schools, going as far as banning the [[crucifix]] in schools and other public areas (the [[Oldenburg]] crucifix struggle of November 1936), and despite the Nazi dissolution and confiscation of Austrian monasteries and the official banning of Catholic newspapers and associations in Austria (\"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), Hudal remained close to some Nazi officials, as he was convinced that the Nazi new order would nevertheless prevail in Europe due to its \"force\".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nHudal was particularly close to von Papen, who as the Reich's ambassador in Vienna prepared the German-Austrian agreement of 11 July 1936, which some claim paved the way for the [[Anschluss]]. This agreement was backed by Hudal in the Austrian press, against the position of several Austrian Bishops.<ref>{{harvp|Chenaux|2003}}</ref>\n\n===Vatican reaction===\nWhen, in 1937, Hudal published his book on the foundations of National Socialism,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937}}</ref> Church authorities were upset because of his deviation from Church policy and teachings. Hudal, without mentioning names, had openly questioned the Vatican policy of [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]] towards National Socialism, which culminated in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', in which the Vatican openly attacked National Socialism. The 1937 Hudal book froze his steady rise in Rome and resulted in his leaving the city after the war. His publication like his two previous, ''{{lang|de|Rom, Christentum und deutsches Volk}}'' (1935) and ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Volk und christliches Abendland}}'' (1935) did not have an [[Imprimatur]] or ecclesiastical approval, which was another reason for the cooling of relations with the Vatican. Hudal had proposed a \"truly Christian National Socialism\": education and church affairs would be controlled by the Church, while political discourse would remain exclusively National Socialist.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=250}}</ref>\n\nThe Nazis had no intention of giving up education to the Church. Together - according to Hudal - Church and state in Germany would fight against Communism.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=17}}</ref> Hudal saw a direct link between Jews and Marxism,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|pp=86, 92}}</ref> lamenting their alleged dominance in academic occupations,<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=87}}</ref> and supporting [[Racial segregation|segregation]] legislation against Jews in order to protect against foreign influence.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1937|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Break with the Vatican===\nHudal, previously a popular and influential guest in the Vatican, lived from 1938 on in isolation in the Anima College. This position he was forced to resign in 1952. Hudal's 1933 promotion to Bishop has been cited as evidence that he had close ties to members of the [[Roman Curia]], particularly Cardinal Merry del Val (who died in 1930), and Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pius XII, who had been Papal Nuncio in Germany. His close relationship with Pacelli and Pius XI stopped immediately after the publication of his book in 1937, which was seen as contradicting ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' and the 1933 [[Reichskonkordat]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Hudal during World War II===\nHudal's exile within Rome continued during World War II. He continued as pastoral head of the Anima Church and College but had no position in the Vatican and no access to Pope Pius XII or his senior staff. The French Jesuit historian, Pierre Blet, co-editor of ''Acts and Documents'', mentioned Hudal only once, stating that the pope's nephew Carlo Pacelli saw Hudal and after this meeting, Hudal wrote to the military governor of Rome, General [[Reiner Stahel|Stahel]], and urged him to suspend all actions against Jews. The Germans suspended the actions \"out of the consideration for the special character of Rome\".<ref>{{harvp|Blet|1997|p=216}}</ref>\n\nAccording to another author, however, the idea of Hudal's intervention came from the German ambassador himself, who asked the rector of the Anima to sign a letter to the military commander of Rome, General [[Reiner Stahel]], requesting that the arrests be halted, otherwise the pope would take a position in public against the arrests and the German occupiers.<ref name=\"Kurzman\">{{harvp|Kurzman|2007|pp=183\u201385}}</ref> Ambassador Weizs\u00e4cker, it was argued, had chosen this ruse because Hitler might have reacted against the Vatican and the Pope if it had been the German embassy conveying the warning, instead of the Nazi-friendly bishop.<ref name=\"Kurzman\"/> However, this account is seriously undermined by Hudal's claim in his Memories that it was the nephew of Pius XII, Carlo Pacelli, who came to see him and inspired the letter <ref>Hudal (1976), pp. 214-15</ref> and by Dr Rainer Decker's discovery among Hudal's papers in the Anima of the original typewritten draft of the letter sent to Stahel.<ref>Decker (2019), pp. 237-39</ref>  This draft, which is much longer than the excerpt from it sent to Berlin, contains Hudal's handwritten corrections, introductory greetings to Stahel recalling their mutual acquaintance Captain Diemert, and a final paragraph noting that, as had previously been discussed last March, Germany might need the good offices of the Vatican in the near future.<ref>Decker (2019), p. 254</ref>  These details could not have been known to Ambassador Weizs\u00e4cker or any of the other diplomats. And this leaves little doubt that the letter was written by Bishop Hudal himself and by no one else, and that it was initiated by a visit from Pius XII's nephew, Carlo Pacelli on the morning of 16 October 1943.\n\nDuring the war Hudal sheltered victims of the Nazis at Santa Maria dell'Anima, used by the Resistance. [[Brigadier general]] John Burns, a [[New Zealand]]er, gave a description of it when recalling his escape from an Italian POW-camp in 1944.<ref>Burns, John.

In his native Austria, his pro-Nazi book was now openly discussed and critiqued.

He viewed it as \"a charity to people in dire need, for persons without any guilt who are to be made scapegoats for the failures of an evil system.\"<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=22}}</ref> He used the services of the Austrian Office (''\u00d6sterreichisches Bureau'') in Rome, which had the necessary identity cards (\"Carta di riconoscimento\"), for migration mainly to [[Arab world|Arab]] and South American countries.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=34}}</ref> It is also alleged that the president of the International Red Cross [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]] and Cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]] were also involved in the \"ratlines\"<ref>[http://www.aish.com/jw/s/Nazi-Havens-in-South-America.html?s=rab Nazi Havens in South America accessed October 25,2018]</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether he was an official appointee of the Papal refugee organization [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]] (PCA) ('Pontifical Commission of Assistance') or whether he acted as [[de facto]] head of the Catholic Austrian community in Rome. He is credited with helping, networking and organising the escape of war criminals such as [[Franz Stangl]], commanding officer of [[Treblinka]]. Stangl told [[Gitta Sereny]]<ref>{{harvp|Sereny|1974}}</ref> that he went looking for Hudal in Rome as he had heard that the bishop was helping all Germans.

Against these allegations of the direct involvement of Pope Pius XII and his staff, there are some opposing testimonies and the denial by Vatican officials of any involvement of Pius XII himself. According to Phayer, Bishop [[Aloisius Muench]], an [[United States|American]] and Pius XII's own envoy to occupied western Germany after the war, \"wrote to the Vatican warning the pope to desist from his efforts to have convicted war criminals excused\". The letter, written in Italian, is extant in the archives of [[Catholic University of America]].<ref>[[Michael Phayer|Phayer, Michael]].

Hudal claims several times in this work to have received criticism of the Nazi system rather than support for it from the Vatican diplomats under Pius XII. He assumed that the Holy See's policy during and after the war was entirely controlled by the western Allies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nUntil his own death, Hudal remained convinced he had done the right thing, and said he considered saving German and other fascist officers and politicians from the hands of Allied prosecution a \"just thing\" and \"what should have been expected of a true Christian\", adding: \"We do not believe in the eye for an eye of the Jew.\"<ref name=\"Hudal_RT_p.21\">{{harvp|Hudal|1976|p=21}}</ref>\n\nHudal said the justice of the Allies and the Soviets had resulted in show trials and lynchings, including the major trials at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]].<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976|pp=220\u2013254}}</ref> In his memoirs, he developed a theory about the economic causes of World War II, which allowed him to plainly justify for himself his acts in favour of Nazi and Fascist war criminals:{{Quote|The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting.

In January 1952, the Bishop of [[Salzburg]] told Hudal that the Holy See wanted to dismiss him. In June, Hudal announced to the cardinal protector of Santa Maria dell'Anima that he had decided to leave the College, disapproving of what he viewed as the Church's governance by the Allies.<ref name=\"Sanfilippo\"/> He resided afterwards in [[Grottaferrata]], near Rome, where in 1962 he wrote his embittered memoirs called ''{{lang|de|R\u00f6mische Tageb\u00fccher, Lebensberichte eines alten Bischofs}}'' (Roman Diaries, Confessions of an Old Bishop), published posthumously in 1976.\n\nUntil his death in 1963, he never gave up in trying to obtain an amnesty for Nazis.{{#tag:ref|In 1959-1960, for example, Hudal's correspondence shows his efforts to obtain an amnesty in Greece and West Germany<ref name=\"Sanfilippo\"/>|group=Note}} Despite his protests against [[anti-Semitism]] in the 1930s, in his memoirs, with full knowledge of the Holocaust as of 1962, the \"Brown Bishop\"{{#tag:ref|In 1949, Hudal was labeled in German \"church circles\" as \"brauner Bischof\", according to the German newspapers ''Nord Press'' (6 December 1949, p. 4) and the above-cited ''Passauer Neue Press'' (13 December 1949, p. 3).|group=Note}} said of his actions in favour of war criminals and genocide perpetrators and participants: \"I thank God that He opened my eyes and allowed me to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and [to help] them escape with false identity papers\" \u2014 however, the \"victims\" were Axis prisoners of war and their \"concentration camps\" were Allied detention camps.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976}}, English translation quoted in {{harvp|Whitlock|2003}}.</ref>\n\nAfter he was banned from Rome by Pius XII, Hudal withdrew to his residence in [[Grottaferrata]], embittered towards Pius XII.<ref>{{harvp|Hudal|1976}}</ref> He died in 1963.
