These Malay rulers still maintain authority over religious affairs in states. The states of [[Penang]], Malacca, [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] do not have any sultan, but the king ([[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]]) plays the role of head of Islam in each of those states as well as in each of the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] of [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] and Putrajaya.\n\nOn the occasion of Malaysia's first prime minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]'s 80th birthday, he stated in the edition of 9 February 1983 of the newspaper ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' that the \"country has a multi-racial population with various beliefs. Malaysia must continue as a secular State with Islam as the official religion\". In the same issue of ''The Star'', Abdul Rahman was supported by the third Malaysian prime minister, [[Hussein Onn]], who stated that the \"nation can still be functional as a secular state with Islam as the official religion.\"<ref>Ooi, J. 2007.

To counter the falling credibility of [[United Malays National Organisation]]'s (UMNO) Islamic credentials vis-\u00e0-vis PAS, the head of the Barisan Nasional, Datuk Seri [[Abdullah Badawi]], proposed Islam Hadhari.

Islam was introduced to the Sumatran coast by Arabs in 674 CE.<ref>W.P. Groeneveldt, 1877, ''Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca'', Batavia : W. Bruining.\n</ref>\n\nIslam was also brought to Malaysia by [[Indian Muslim]] traders in the 12th century AD. It is commonly held that Islam first arrived in Malay peninsular since [[Mudzaffar Shah I of Kedah|Sultan Mudzafar Shah\u00a0I]] (12th century) of Kedah (Hindu name Phra Ong Mahawangsa), the first ruler to be known to [[List of converts to Islam|convert to Islam]] after being introduced to it by Indian traders who themselves were recent converts. In the 13th century, the [[Terengganu Stone Monument]] was found at [[Kuala Berang]], Terengganu, where the first Malay state to receive Islam in 1303 Sultan Megat Iskandar Shah, known as [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] prior to his conversion, is the first [[Malacca Sultanate|Sultan of Melaka]]. He converted to Islam after marrying a princess from [[Pasai]], of present-day [[Indonesia]].\n\nThe religion was adopted peacefully by the coastal trading ports people of Malaysia and Indonesia, absorbing rather than conquering existing beliefs. By the 15th and 16th centuries it was the majority faith of the Malay people.\n\n===Contemporary Islam===\nReligion, specifically [[Shafi\u2018i]]te school Sunnism. Some Islamic terms, such as the word Allah, are forbidden to non-Muslims both orally and in government's ban on the use of the word \"Allah\" by non-Muslims, reversing the 2009 ruling of a court of first instance.\n\nUntil the 1970s, many Malay Muslims lived a liberal and moderate Islam, like Indonesian Muslims. At this time, a wave of Islamisation emerged (sparked by various social and ethnic conflicts, linked to the Al-Arqam parties and Islam Se-Malaysia), so that today, Malaysia lives in a more Islamic environment compared to the latter years. Malays, who represent 50.4% of the total population, are almost all Muslims. About 70 per cent of Malay Muslims wear headscarves, while their port was marginal until the 1980s. The traditional Malay garment, of Islamic origin, is also worn by many Malays.\n\n===Freedom of worship===\nArticle 3 (1) of the Malaysian Constitution provides:\n\n\"Islam is the religion of the Federation; but other religions can be practiced safely and peacefully in all parts of the Federation.\"\n\nArticle 11 of the constitution provides:\n\n\"Everyone has the right to profess and practice his religion and to propagate it.\"\n\nOriginally authorised for the country's independence in 1957, apostasy became illegal following an amendment to the country's constitution in 1988.<ref>http://www.ea.org.au/ea-family/Religious-Liberty/The-Islamisation-of-Malaysia</ref> The international scandal unleashed by the Lina Joy<ref>https://www.economist.com/asia/2007/05/31/lina-joys-despair</ref> affair is one of the most famous representations.\n\nWhile this was not a problem during the colonial era, Muslims wishing to change their religion face severe deterrence. Before 1988, the question of freedom of religion and therefore of questions relating to the desire of citizens to change their religion was exclusively within the jurisdiction of secular courts. But since the law has changed, an amendment stipulates that secular courts no longer have the right to deal with claims by Muslims and that only Islamic Shariah courts have jurisdiction to discuss issues related to human rights.<ref>https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religious-conversion-and-sharia-law</ref> [[Apostasy]] is one of them and it follows that it is constitutionally legally impossible for a Muslim to change his belief.\n\nMany Muslims who have changed their religion whether it is conversion to Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism, Taoism and other beliefs are forced for their own safety to lead a double life. In some cases denunciations of apostasy have already been reported as being reported to the authorities by family members or co-workers.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6150340.stm</ref><ref>https://www.nationalreview.com/2007/06/right-not-be-muslim-doug-bandow/</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, Edry Faizal, a coordinator in charge of the Democratic Action Party, claimed that it was inconsistent from a Quranic point of view to forbid Muslims from freely changing beliefs, but from his point of view was the best alternative that the power had found to preserve its Malaysian electorate and consequently to remain in power continuously.\n\nIn May 2014, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said during his speech about the future of the country that: \"We will never tolerate any demand for the right to apostasy by Muslims, and we refuse that Muslims can have the right to be tried by courts other than sharia courts, and we will not allow Muslims to participate in LGBT activities\". But he concluded that this was necessary because: \"This is in line with our efforts to make Malaysia a modern, progressive Muslim country in order to achieve the status of a developed nation with a high income for 2020\".<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/muslims-threatened-by-liberalism-secularism-and-lgbt-says-najib-bernama</ref>\n\nIn recent years, more and more voices have been asked to try to determine the number of ethnic Malay people supposed to have left Islam for another belief, the government has remained silent on the question that it is much too controversial for to be debated. However, in October 2011, Harussani Zakaria, the mufti of the state of Perak,<ref>https://www.newmandala.org/apostasy-in-malaysia-the-hidden-view/</ref> said that according to a 2008 government report that was kept secret, there would have been more than 260,000 Malayans since 1988 who secretly converted to Christianity, which would represent according to the 2010 population census, between 3 and 4% of the Malaysian majority.<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/deklarasi-himpunan-sejuta-umat-mahu-akta-murtad-digubal-segera</ref> Nevertheless, no data estimating the number of Malay converted to another religion was provided.\n\nNonetheless, these remarks later triggered a polemic repeatedly repeated in the media by Islamist and nationalist circles that recognising the right of the Malayans and the entire Muslim community to be free to choose their own beliefs would risk provoking a \"Massive exodus of apostates\" within the nation, the same slogan has also been listed on the official website of Islam in Malaysia. On December 17, 2015, Malaysian Police Chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar (in) during a speech, alluded to this mysterious report: \"I can not tell you how much this issue is and potentially explosive. \"<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/top-cop-confirms-reports-lodged-over-attempts-to-convert-muslims</ref>\n\n===Religious discrimination===\nAs Islam is the religion of the Federation, converts to Islam are allowed to convert their children to Islam without having to consider the approval of his spouse.\n\nConversely, the state banishes and sanctions non-Muslim proselytism, but encourages conversions to Islam<ref>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FG28Ae01.html</ref> and remunerates them in order to facilitate the reduction of the non-Muslim population within the nation. Among the new rights provided to converts, if they have child/children, they have the right to convert their children by force to Islam,<ref>https://www.malaymail.com/s/1059919/resolving-interfaith-disputes-a-constitutional-court-for-malaysia-andrew-yo</ref><ref>https://www.thebereancall.org/content/malaysia-move-legalize-forced-conversion-minors-government-attempts-further-islamize-law-ste</ref> without having to consider the approval of his spouse.<ref>https://www.malaymail.com/s/1001071/dayak-parents-told-to-be-less-sensitive-amid-protests-over-new-muslim-princ</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, unrest erupted in Miri, Sarawak, when a 13-year-old Dayak schoolgirl complained to the police, along with her parents, after being sequestrated at her school by two of her teachers who wanted to convert her to Islam by forcing her to recite Shahada. The latter then rewarded his conversion by donating 250 ringgit. In order to ease interfaith tensions, the two teachers were subsequently fired and transferred out of the state of Sarawak.<ref>http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/converting_children_unilaterally_is_un_islamic_court_told_in_indira_gandhi_case.html</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2015, Malaysian feminist and human rights activist, Shafiqah Othman Hamzah said, \"What we are living in Malaysia is almost no different from apartheid. While segregation was racial in South Africa, in our country we live in religious segregation.\"<ref>https://www.malaymail.com/s/1016713/are-we-headed-for-a-malaysian-apartheid</ref>\n\nOn February 9, 2016,<ref>https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/02/10/syariah-court-has-no-jurisdiction-on-civil-marriages/</ref> the Putrajaya Federal Court ruled on a scandal termed the  \"S Deepa Affair\" dating back to September 4, 2013, involving forced conversions of children to Islam in a Hindu couple married since 2003. In this case, the father N. Viran converted to Islam in November 2012 under the name of Izwan Abdullah decided to impose his conversion to his two children, his son Mithran and his daughter Sharmila. Shortly after that, the children had their names changed to Nabil for the son and Nurul Nabila for the girl. Becoming the only person judged capable of raising them, he had obtained from the Shari'a court of Seremban their sole custody and through this the dissolution of his marriage.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTheir marriage, which had been celebrated according to the Hindu rites and subsequently registered in the civil registers, was thus dissolved by the Shari'a court on the sole ground of the conversion to Islam by the husband, making it immediately obsolete. However, the Seremban High Court ruled that the annulment of the marriage was illegal and decided to return the custody of the children to the mother on April 7, 2014.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nHowever, two days later Izwan kidnapped his son during a home visit by his ex-wife. Deepa quickly requested the High Court for police aid in getting her son back. Izwan decided to appeal the decision by the Seremban High Court and sought the help from the Shari'a court to assert his rights. The Court of Appeal rejected both appeals in December 2014. Child custody in February 2016 was finally divided by the Court of Appeal. The guard of the son was entrusted to the father, in this case, Izwan and the guard of the daughter to the mother, S Deepa.<ref>https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/02/11/each-parent-gets-one-child-federal-court-grants-custody-of-boy-to-izwan-while-deepa-is-given-the-dau</ref> Asked by the media at the announcement of the verdict, she announced in tears: \"This is injustice, I am upset.

Mosques are an ordinary scene throughout the country and [[adhan]] (call to prayer) from [[minaret]]s are heard [[salat|five times a day]]. Government bodies and banking institutions are closed for two hours every Friday so Muslim workers can conduct [[Friday prayer]] in mosques.

It has been introduced to several states, notably Kelantan and Terengganu, all businesses close for 2 hours on every Friday for prayers. Failure to comply would result in fines.\n\nSince it is compulsory for Muslims to perform a prayer 5 times a day no matter where they are, almost all public places, including shopping malls, hotels, condominiums, usually have allocated spaces called \"[[Surau]]\", for performing the Muslim prayers.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that [[Wahhabism]] is spreading among Malaysia's elite, and that the traditional Islamic theology currently taught in Government schools is gradually being shifted to a view of theology derived from the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/01/14/wahabism-spreading-among-malaysias-elite/|title=Wahabism spreading among Malaysia\u2019s elite|date=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/08/28/the-radicalisation-of-islam-in-malaysia-academicians-worry-that-an-exclusivist-way-of-interpretating/|title=The radicalisation of Islam in Malaysia|date=28 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Shia Islam===\nThe Malaysian government has strict policies against other Islamic sects, including a complete ban on [[Shia Islam]],<ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2001-02/10/article7.shtml \"Rights Group Says Six Malaysians Detained For Being Shia Muslims\"], ''Islam Online''.

A significant number of words in the Malay vocabulary can trace their origins to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which is the common language of Islamic prayer and rituals. This is, however, not exclusive and words from other cultures such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Chinese, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], English, and French can also be found in the Malay language. Islam is so ingrained in Malay life that Islamic rituals are practised as Malay culture.

Prominent Malaysian female examples are Datuk Seri [[Rafidah Aziz]], International Trade and Industry Minister and Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, wife of the current Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad]]. However, with the influx of Arabic travellers, foreign Muslim women ([[Arabs]]) wearing [[hijab]] that leave only their eyes exposed are often spotted in tourist attractions, not the least at the shopping malls. At certain Malaysian institutions such as the International Islamic University, wearing of the tudung is mandatory; however, for non-Muslim students this usually amounts to a loosely worn piece of cloth draped over the back of the head.\n[[Image:Malaysian girls.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The ''tudung'' is very commonly worn by Malay girls and women]]\n\nSome regard the ''tudung'' to be an indication of Arabic influence in Malay Muslim culture, and point to incidents such as the banning of the traditional Malay ''[[wayang kulit]]'' in the state of Kelantan (which was ruled by the [[Islamist]] [[Islamic Party of Malaysia|PAS]]) to be \"un-Islamic\".<ref>Kent, Jonathan (6 August 2005).

A tertiary textbook for Malaysian studies following the government-approved syllabus states: \"This explains the fact that when a non-Malay embraces Islam, he is said to ''masuk Melayu'' (\"become a Malay\").

Bruining.\n</ref>\n\nIslam was also brought to Malaysia by [[Indian Muslim]] traders in the 12th century AD. It is commonly held that Islam first arrived in Malay peninsular since [[Mudzaffar Shah I of Kedah|Sultan Mudzafar Shah\u00a0I]] (12th century) of Kedah (Hindu name Phra Ong Mahawangsa), the first ruler to be known to [[List of converts to Islam|convert to Islam]] after being introduced to it by Indian traders who themselves were recent converts. In the 13th century, the [[Terengganu Stone Monument]] was found at [[Kuala Berang]], Terengganu, where the first Malay state to receive Islam in 1303 Sultan Megat Iskandar Shah, known as [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] prior to his conversion, is the first [[Malacca Sultanate|Sultan of Melaka]]. He converted to Islam after marrying a princess from [[Pasai]], of present-day [[Indonesia]].\n\nThe religion was adopted peacefully by the coastal trading ports people of Malaysia and Indonesia, absorbing rather than conquering existing beliefs. By the 15th and 16th centuries it was the majority faith of the Malay people.\n\n===Contemporary Islam===\nReligion, specifically [[Shafi\u2018i]]te school Sunnism. Some Islamic terms, such as the word Allah, are forbidden to non-Muslims both orally and in government's ban on the use of the word \"Allah\" by non-Muslims, reversing the 2009 ruling of a court of first instance.\n\nUntil the 1970s, many Malay Muslims lived a liberal and moderate Islam, like Indonesian Muslims. At this time, a wave of Islamisation emerged (sparked by various social and ethnic conflicts, linked to the Al-Arqam parties and Islam Se-Malaysia), so that today, Malaysia lives in a more Islamic environment compared to the latter years. Malays, who represent 50.4% of the total population, are almost all Muslims. About 70 per cent of Malay Muslims wear headscarves, while their port was marginal until the 1980s. The traditional Malay garment, of Islamic origin, is also worn by many Malays.\n\n===Freedom of worship===\nArticle 3 (1) of the Malaysian Constitution provides:\n\n\"Islam is the religion of the Federation; but other religions can be practiced safely and peacefully in all parts of the Federation.\"\n\nArticle 11 of the constitution provides:\n\n\"Everyone has the right to profess and practice his religion and to propagate it.\"\n\nOriginally authorised for the country's independence in 1957, apostasy became illegal following an amendment to the country's constitution in 1988.<ref>http://www.ea.org.au/ea-family/Religious-Liberty/The-Islamisation-of-Malaysia</ref> The international scandal unleashed by the Lina Joy<ref>https://www.economist.com/asia/2007/05/31/lina-joys-despair</ref> affair is one of the most famous representations.\n\nWhile this was not a problem during the colonial era, Muslims wishing to change their religion face severe deterrence. Before 1988, the question of freedom of religion and therefore of questions relating to the desire of citizens to change their religion was exclusively within the jurisdiction of secular courts. But since the law has changed, an amendment stipulates that secular courts no longer have the right to deal with claims by Muslims and that only Islamic Shariah courts have jurisdiction to discuss issues related to human rights.<ref>https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religious-conversion-and-sharia-law</ref> [[Apostasy]] is one of them and it follows that it is constitutionally legally impossible for a Muslim to change his belief.\n\nMany Muslims who have changed their religion whether it is conversion to Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism, Taoism and other beliefs are forced for their own safety to lead a double life.

But he concluded that this was necessary because: \"This is in line with our efforts to make Malaysia a modern, progressive Muslim country in order to achieve the status of a developed nation with a high income for 2020\".<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/muslims-threatened-by-liberalism-secularism-and-lgbt-says-najib-bernama</ref>\n\nIn recent years, more and more voices have been asked to try to determine the number of ethnic Malay people supposed to have left Islam for another belief, the government has remained silent on the question that it is much too controversial for to be debated. However, in October 2011, Harussani Zakaria, the mufti of the state of Perak,<ref>https://www.newmandala.org/apostasy-in-malaysia-the-hidden-view/</ref> said that according to a 2008 government report that was kept secret, there would have been more than 260,000 Malayans since 1988 who secretly converted to Christianity, which would represent according to the 2010 population census, between 3 and 4% of the Malaysian majority.<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/deklarasi-himpunan-sejuta-umat-mahu-akta-murtad-digubal-segera</ref> Nevertheless, no data estimating the number of Malay converted to another religion was provided.\n\nNonetheless, these remarks later triggered a polemic repeatedly repeated in the media by Islamist and nationalist circles that recognising the right of the Malayans and the entire Muslim community to be free to choose their own beliefs would risk provoking a \"Massive exodus of apostates\" within the nation, the same slogan has also been listed on the official website of Islam in Malaysia. On December 17, 2015, Malaysian Police Chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar (in) during a speech, alluded to this mysterious report: \"I can not tell you how much this issue is and potentially explosive. \"<ref>http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/top-cop-confirms-reports-lodged-over-attempts-to-convert-muslims</ref>\n\n===Religious discrimination===\nAs Islam is the religion of the Federation, converts to Islam are allowed to convert their children to Islam without having to consider the approval of his spouse.\n\nConversely, the state banishes and sanctions non-Muslim proselytism, but encourages conversions to Islam<ref>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FG28Ae01.html</ref> and remunerates them in order to facilitate the reduction of the non-Muslim population within the nation.

The latter then rewarded his conversion by donating 250 ringgit. In order to ease interfaith tensions, the two teachers were subsequently fired and transferred out of the state of Sarawak.<ref>http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/converting_children_unilaterally_is_un_islamic_court_told_in_indira_gandhi_case.html</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2015, Malaysian feminist and human rights activist, Shafiqah Othman Hamzah said, \"What we are living in Malaysia is almost no different from apartheid.

In this case, the father N. Viran converted to Islam in November 2012 under the name of Izwan Abdullah decided to impose his conversion to his two children, his son Mithran and his daughter Sharmila. Shortly after that, the children had their names changed to Nabil for the son and Nurul Nabila for the girl. Becoming the only person judged capable of raising them, he had obtained from the Shari'a court of Seremban their sole custody and through this the dissolution of his marriage.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTheir marriage, which had been celebrated according to the Hindu rites and subsequently registered in the civil registers, was thus dissolved by the Shari'a court on the sole ground of the conversion to Islam by the husband, making it immediately obsolete. However, the Seremban High Court ruled that the annulment of the marriage was illegal and decided to return the custody of the children to the mother on April 7, 2014.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nHowever, two days later Izwan kidnapped his son during a home visit by his ex-wife. Deepa quickly requested the High Court for police aid in getting her son back. Izwan decided to appeal the decision by the Seremban High Court and sought the help from the Shari'a court to assert his rights. The Court of Appeal rejected both appeals in December 2014. Child custody in February 2016 was finally divided by the Court of Appeal. The guard of the son was entrusted to the father, in this case, Izwan and the guard of the daughter to the mother, S Deepa.<ref>https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/02/11/each-parent-gets-one-child-federal-court-grants-custody-of-boy-to-izwan-while-deepa-is-given-the-dau</ref> Asked by the media at the announcement of the verdict, she announced in tears: \"This is injustice, I am upset.

A significant number of words in the Malay vocabulary can trace their origins to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which is the common language of Islamic prayer and rituals. This is, however, not exclusive and words from other cultures such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Chinese, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], English, and French can also be found in the Malay language. Islam is so ingrained in Malay life that Islamic rituals are practised as Malay culture. Muslim and Malays are interchangeable in many daily contexts.\n\nHari Raya Aidilfitri ([[Eid al-Fitr|Eid ul-Fitr]]) is an important festival celebrated by Malaysian Muslims.\n\nMuslim women generally wear the ''[[Tudong|tudung]]'' ([[hijab]] or headscarf) over their heads. However, Malay women not wearing any headgear are not reprimanded or penalised. Prominent Malaysian female examples are Datuk Seri [[Rafidah Aziz]], International Trade and Industry Minister and Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, wife of the current Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad]]. However, with the influx of Arabic travellers, foreign Muslim women ([[Arabs]]) wearing [[hijab]] that leave only their eyes exposed are often spotted in tourist attractions, not the least at the shopping malls. At certain Malaysian institutions such as the International Islamic University, wearing of the tudung is mandatory; however, for non-Muslim students this usually amounts to a loosely worn piece of cloth draped over the back of the head.\n[[Image:Malaysian girls.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The ''tudung'' is very commonly worn by Malay girls and women]]\n\nSome regard the ''tudung'' to be an indication of Arabic influence in Malay Muslim culture, and point to incidents such as the banning of the traditional Malay ''[[wayang kulit]]'' in the state of Kelantan (which was ruled by the [[Islamist]] [[Islamic Party of Malaysia|PAS]]) to be \"un-Islamic\".<ref>Kent, Jonathan (6 August 2005).

Consequently, apostate Malays would have to forfeit all their constitutional privileges, including their [[Bumiputra]] status, which entitles them to [[affirmative action]] in university admissions and discounts on purchases of vehicles or real estate. It is legally possible to become a Malay if a non-Malay citizen with a Malaysian parent converts to Islam and thus claims all the Bumiputra privileges granted by [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153 of the Constitution]] and the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP). However, the convert must \"habitually speak the [[Malay language]]\" and adhere to Malay culture. A tertiary textbook for Malaysian studies following the government-approved syllabus states: \"This explains the fact that when a non-Malay embraces Islam, he is said to ''masuk Melayu'' (\"become a Malay\"). That person is automatically assumed to be fluent in the Malay language and to be living like a Malay as a result of his close association with the Malays\".<ref>Shuid, Mahdi & Yunus, Mohd.

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]].\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the [[Type 82 destroyer]]s and replaced Seaslug through the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\nA contemporary project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile, and its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of a much higher-performance radar-guided weapon,{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\", with the initial requirements released in December 1944.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} LOPGAP soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP.{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of GAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===RTV===\nIn 1946, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) formed its Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nTwo systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}}\n\nNoticing that the performance requirements outlined by the Navy, Army and Air Force were roughly the same, they proposed a two-stage development program, with Stage 1 delivering missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s with greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs work continued, it was recognized that development by the existing GAP participants would take too long and so a larger industry team was required. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]].

It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]].

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]].\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 and replaced Seaslug through the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\nA contemporary project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile, and its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of a much higher-performance radar-guided weapon,{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\", with the initial requirements released in December 1944.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} LOPGAP soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP.{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of GAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===RTV===\nIn 1946, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) formed its Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nTwo systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}}\n\nNoticing that the performance requirements outlined by the Navy, Army and Air Force were roughly the same, they proposed a two-stage development program, with Stage 1 delivering missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s with greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs work continued, it was recognized that development by the existing GAP participants would take too long and so a larger industry team was required. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]]. This version is based on the RAE's early GPV, and retains the rear-mounted boosters before they moved forward on the \"long round\".]]\nThere were two main variants of the Seaslug:\n\n===Mark 1 (GWS.1)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 1 was powered by the solid-fuel ''Foxhound'' (390&nbsp;kg fuel) sustainer motor{{efn-lr|There is a common error about a liquid-fuel sustainer on this model.}} and ''Gosling''(145&nbsp;kg) booster motors. It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]].
