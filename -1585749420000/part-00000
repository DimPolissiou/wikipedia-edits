In 1959 he was closest to winning the Tour de France, when he finished second, 4:01 behind [[Federico Bahamontes]]. In 1960 he wore the [[yellow jersey]] for two days.\n\n==Origins==\nHenry Anglade was born in Thionville, in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of France close to the German border, the son of a soldier. His family moved south to [[Lyon]] at the start of the [[second world war]]. There he went to school with a boy called Andr\u00e9 Camus who went cycling on Sundays and on Thursday afternoons. Anglade turned down his invitation to join him. It was his father who suggested that he should go, offering him the heavy family bicycle \"that weighed at least 25kg\". He joined Camus and his friends and found they couldn't keep up. One suggested he should try racing and he joined the V\u00e9lo Club du Griffon, the oldest club in Lyon. That was when he bought himself a Longoni sports bike and tried racing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Coup de P\u00e9dales, Belgium, undated cutting</ref>\n\nHe worked with an engineering company until he could support himself from racing.<ref>[http://www.siteducyclisme.net/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=236 Henri Anglade]. siteducyclisme.net</ref>\n\n==Professional racing==\nHenry Anglade turned professional in 1957. In 1959, he won the [[Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], a mountainous stage race over a week; then the national road championship. He came second in the [[Tour de Suisse]] and then in the [[Tour de France]], behind [[Federico Bahamontes]] but in front of [[Jacques Anquetil]] and [[Roger Rivi\u00e8re]]. In that Tour, Anglade \u2013 riding for the regional Centre-Midi team \u2013 was the victim of the tactics of Anquetil, Rivi\u00e8re and others in the French national team. They preferred to see Bahamontes take the Tour de France rather than Anglade, who was unpopular among French riders and, had he won the Tour de France, would have earned more than Anquetil and Rivi\u00e8re in the post-Tour [[criteriums]] that were then an important part of riders' incomes. Bahamontes was both Spanish and a poor rider in round-the-houses races and so of little threat. On top of that, Anquetil, Rivi\u00e8re and many other French stars were represented by Daniel Dousset, one of the two agents who divided French cycling, whereas Anglade was represented by the other, Roger Piel.<ref>McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, USA</ref> That was why Anglade had been left out of the national team to ride for a regional one.<ref name=\"humanite.fr\">[https://archive.is/20110609073445/http://www.humanite.fr/2001-07-13_Sports_L-hydre-aux-quatre-tetes-Fait-tomber-celle-d-Anglade ]</ref>\n\nAt the stage finish in [[Grenoble]], Dousset was there to meet [[Fausto Coppi]], who was Bahamontes' sponsor, and the riders in the national team whom he represented. \u00c9mile Besson wrote in ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'': \"Dousset offered contracts for criteriums by the shovel load for after the Tour of Spain. Anglade's head, second in Paris, had fallen.\"<ref name=\"humanite.fr\"/><ref>A reference to the guillotine.</ref> Fans worked out what was going on and Anquetil was whistled and jeered as he entered the [[Parc des Princes]] on the last day. Anglade said: \"I've got no regrets about it. Racing is like that. And anyway I make it a principle to live without regrets.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAnglade was not the strongest of riders but made up for what he lacked with a good tactical sense. He was an eloquent speaker and popular with journalists. Riders, however, disliked him for what they perceived as his bossiness and gave him the [[nickname]] [[Napoleon]], which referred as well to his smallness.\n\nAnglade joined the Pelforth-Sauvage-Lejeune in 1963 and finished the next year's Tour de France in fourth place, behind Anquetil, [[Raymond Poulidor]] and Bahamontes. He also came fourth in the 1965 race, behind [[Felice Gimondi]], Poulidor and [[Gianni Motta]].\n\nHis health disturbed his 1966 season and he spent his last season, 1967, as a team rider for [[Raymond Poulidor]]. He rode 10 Tours de France and finished all but his last.\n\n===1959 national championship===\nThe 1959 national championship used the car racing circuit at [[Monthl\u00e9ry]]. Anglade was in a leading group with five laps left.  [[Louison Bobet]] was leading the chase. The [[Commissaire (cycling)|commissaire]]s had got as far as clearing following cars out of the way so that the chasers could regain the leaders. Anglade dropped to the back of his group, had something to eat, and set off alone when Bobet and the others were nearly on them. The others hesitated and the chasers eased up when the two groups came together. Anglade was convinced he'd won and eased up with 100m left to raise his hands in victory.\n\n\"He thought he'd won,\" said a report, \"and sat up to salute the crowd. ''L'impudent''! He had barely crossed the line when he was passed by [[Jean Forestier]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Privat]], who had also broken away and were sprinting for second place.\" <ref name=\"Cyclo, France, October 1992\">Cyclo, France, October 1992</ref>\n\n===1965 national championship===\nThe [[Pelforth]] team met the night before the championship at a hotel near the circuit. The manager, Maurice de Muer, said: \"Anyone intending to be champion of France, raise a hand.\" Four put up their hands, including [[Georges Groussard]] and Anglade. Anglade said: \"Right, that's three too many. You three who fancy the jersey, I consider you adversaries. As for the rest of you with no particular ambitions, ride for me because I'm going to be French champion.\"<ref name=\"Cyclo, France, October 1992\"/>\n\nAnother Pelforth rider, Hubert Ferrer, broke away alone for 170&nbsp;km. He was caught 30&nbsp;km from the line. The peloton was tired from chasing and repeated attacks. [[Raymond Delisle]] went away when Ferrer was caught. Anglade caught him, the two stayed together for a while and then Anglade went away alone with five laps to go. He said:\n\n:I knew that behind me, [[Jacques Anquetil]] and [[Raymond Poulidor]] would be neutralising each other, so I decided to keep the peloton at a minute. I realised quickly that I had a friend in the announcer. I could hear the loudspeakers perfectly right round the course and when he said '55 seconds', I accelerated. When I heard '1m 5s', I eased back a bit to recover. It worked so well that I crossed the line a minute and five seconds ahead of Poulidor and Anquetil.<ref name=\"Cyclo, France, October 1992\"/>\n\n===General de Gaulle===\nAnglade was in the French national jersey when the race stopped unexpectedly at [[Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises]] to greet [[Charles de Gaulle]], the president, in his village. Anglade said:\n\n:I had stopped to relieve myself. I was just coming back up through the following cars when [[Jacques Goddet]] called me to say that the General was on the course. He asked me 'Could you imagine stopping?', a strange question to ask me, Napoleon, given that I used to get fined if I put a foot down on the road. I said we could stop but provided there was no penalty. I went up to the front of the race to warn the leaders, Nencini, Adriaenssens. In the wood of La Boisserie [de Gaulle's estate] the bodyguards were already across the road, and so we all stopped. The general came down the slope, he greeted me first and then Nencini, telling him he was going to win, and then he went back and we set off again. I often wondered why he had spoken to me first and then later I got the answer. The General was vising Lyon and I was one of those invited. The chef du protocole introduced me and the General said 'One does not introduce Henry Anglade'. I asked him why and he said 'You were wearing our flag and I owed it to you' [''je vous devais bien \u00e7a''].<ref name=\"velo101.com\">[http://www.velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=4065&Section=elites1 V\u00e9lo 101 le site officiel du v\u00e9lo \u2013 cyclisme vtt cyclosport cyclo-cross]. Velo101.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-27.</ref>\n\nIt was the first time the Tour had stopped during a stage.\n\n===Downhill race===\nHenry Anglade's downhill race with [[Gastone Nencini]] has become part of the legend of cycling. Anglade was a proud rider and Nencini one of the fastest down hills. \"The only reason to follow Nencini down mountains is if you have a death wish,\" was how [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] put it. It was in trying to follow Nencini down a mountain that [[Roger Rivi\u00e8re]] missed a bend, crashed over a wall and broke his spine.\n\nAnglade and Nencini met at a col in the [[Dolomites]] during the [[Giro d'Italia]]. The weather was bad and a snowstorm had forced 57 riders to abandon that day. Anglade said:\n\n:I couldn't tolerate the idea that Nencini was the best descender of the peloton. I said to him, call the blackboard man,<ref>A motorcyclist who times riders' lead or deficit during a race and displays it on a blackboard</ref> we'll do the descent together and whoever comes second pays for the [[aperitif]]s this evening. So he called the ''ardoisier'' and asked him to follow us. The road was of compressed earth. We attacked the drop flat out. I let Nencini take the lead so that I could see how he negotiated the bends before attacking him. In the end I dropped as though I was alone. At the bottom, I had taken 32 seconds out of him, written on the blackboard. I was really tickled. I had beaten Nencini. The next time I saw him was that evening in the hotel I was staying at. He had just bought me an ap\u00e9ritif!<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Doping===\nAnglade raced at a time when riders made much of their income in the criterium races, for which they were paid start money as well as prizes, that followed the Tour de France. In 1967, in the concern about doping that followed the [[death of Tom Simpson]] in the Tour four months earlier, Anglade said: \"I've driven 4,000km in three days, I've ridden 400km of race with only six hours in bed. Do you think I could have done that contenting myself with drinking lemonade?\"<ref>Miroir des Sports, 30 November 1967, p. 16</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n\nAnglade crashed in a [[criterium]] at [[Mont\u00e9limar]] in 1966 and broke his [[Vertebral column|spine]]. He said:\n\n:I was mixing it with [[Raymond Poulidor]] [''on s'amusait \u00e0 se tirer la bourre avec Poulidor'']. I was in front and he was trying to join me. We were approaching a bend and I stepped on the gas and unfortunately my pedal touched the road. I flew off the bike: fractured vertebral column. I was at the end of my contract with [[Pelforth]] and it wasn't being renewed. [[Antonin Magne]], the manager of [[Mercier (cycling team)|Mercier]], going through Roger Piel, my agent, opened the door for me. For me it was a real pleasure. But I never really came back to my old level. So I wrote a letter of resignation, explaining that I didn't deserve to be paid to be a racer. Magne phoned me: he'd never seen such a thing. The book of my career closed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n \nAnglade left cycling on 13 September to work for the Olympia typewriter company with one of his cousins. He wanted no more to do with cycling until, in 1975, the Lejeune brothers who ran a bike factory in [[Paris]] and sponsored a team invited him to join.<ref name=\"velo101.com\"/> He managed Lejeune-BP in three Tours de France, where he managed [[Roy Schuiten]], [[Ferdinand Bracke]] and [[Lucien Van Impe]]. He said the team lacked leaders and wasn't a success.<ref name=\"velo101.com\"/>\n\n[[File:vitrailduvelo.jpg|thumb|200px| Stained-glass window at the Notre Dame des Cyclistes]]Anglade learned how to make stained-glass windows and designed and created those in the cyclists' chapel, [[Notre Dame des Cyclistes]] at [[Labastide-d'Armagnac]] in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]]. He said:\n\n:Ever since I was really tiny, I have always admired stained-glass windows. When I was a choir boy, I couldn't follow the Mass because I was in ecstasy in front of a window. Somehow I had it in my skin. Five years ago I went to a demonstration of how the windows were made and I flipped. I signed on for more. I made a window of the Virgin, which I gave to Father Massi\u00e9 for the 40th anniversary of the [[Notre Dame des Cyclistes]] at La Bastide d'Armagnac. I was really proud and happy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe professional cyclist's habit of endorsing commercial products never left him. in 2008 he endorsed the brand of hearing aid that he wore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonak.fr/ccfr/consumer/testimonials_fr.htm |title=Henry Anglade, ancien professionnel de cyclisme et atteint de presbyacousie et \u00e9quip\u00e9 d\u2019un intra-auriculaire Claro |accessdate=2008-11-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330021128/http://www.phonak.fr/ccfr/consumer/testimonials_fr.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}.

It was in trying to follow Nencini down a mountain that [[Roger Rivi\u00e8re]] missed a bend, crashed over a wall and broke his spine.\n\nAnglade and Nencini met at a col in the [[Dolomites]] during the [[Giro d'Italia]]. The weather was bad and a snowstorm had forced 57 riders to abandon that day. Anglade said:\n\n:I couldn't tolerate the idea that Nencini was the best descender of the peloton. I said to him, call the blackboard man,<ref>A motorcyclist who times riders' lead or deficit during a race and displays it on a blackboard</ref> we'll do the descent together and whoever comes second pays for the [[aperitif]]s this evening. So he called the ''ardoisier'' and asked him to follow us. The road was of compressed earth. We attacked the drop flat out. I let Nencini take the lead so that I could see how he negotiated the bends before attacking him. In the end I dropped as though I was alone. At the bottom, I had taken 32 seconds out of him, written on the blackboard. I was really tickled. I had beaten Nencini. The next time I saw him was that evening in the hotel I was staying at. He had just bought me an ap\u00e9ritif!<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Doping===\nAnglade raced at a time when riders made much of their income in the criterium races, for which they were paid start money as well as prizes, that followed the Tour de France. In 1967, in the concern about doping that followed the [[death of Tom Simpson]] in the Tour four months earlier, Anglade said: \"I've driven 4,000km in three days, I've ridden 400km of race with only six hours in bed. Do you think I could have done that contenting myself with drinking lemonade?\"<ref>Miroir des Sports, 30 November 1967, p. 16</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n\nAnglade crashed in a [[criterium]] at [[Mont\u00e9limar]] in 1966 and broke his [[Vertebral column|spine]]. He said:\n\n:I was mixing it with [[Raymond Poulidor]] [''on s'amusait \u00e0 se tirer la bourre avec Poulidor'']. I was in front and he was trying to join me. We were approaching a bend and I stepped on the gas and unfortunately my pedal touched the road. I flew off the bike: fractured vertebral column. I was at the end of my contract with [[Pelforth]] and it wasn't being renewed. [[Antonin Magne]], the manager of [[Mercier (cycling team)|Mercier]], going through Roger Piel, my agent, opened the door for me. For me it was a real pleasure. But I never really came back to my old level. So I wrote a letter of resignation, explaining that I didn't deserve to be paid to be a racer. Magne phoned me: he'd never seen such a thing. The book of my career closed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n \nAnglade left cycling on 13 September to work for the Olympia typewriter company with one of his cousins. He wanted no more to do with cycling until, in 1975, the Lejeune brothers who ran a bike factory in [[Paris]] and sponsored a team invited him to join.<ref name=\"velo101.com\"/> He managed Lejeune-BP in three Tours de France, where he managed [[Roy Schuiten]], [[Ferdinand Bracke]] and [[Lucien Van Impe]]. He said the team lacked leaders and wasn't a success.<ref name=\"velo101.com\"/>\n\n[[File:vitrailduvelo.jpg|thumb|200px| Stained-glass window at the Notre Dame des Cyclistes]]Anglade learned how to make stained-glass windows and designed and created those in the cyclists' chapel, [[Notre Dame des Cyclistes]] at [[Labastide-d'Armagnac]] in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]]. He said:\n\n:Ever since I was really tiny, I have always admired stained-glass windows. When I was a choir boy, I couldn't follow the Mass because I was in ecstasy in front of a window. Somehow I had it in my skin. Five years ago I went to a demonstration of how the windows were made and I flipped. I signed on for more. I made a window of the Virgin, which I gave to Father Massi\u00e9 for the 40th anniversary of the [[Notre Dame des Cyclistes]] at La Bastide d'Armagnac. I was really proud and happy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe professional cyclist's habit of endorsing commercial products never left him. in 2008 he endorsed the brand of hearing aid that he wore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonak.fr/ccfr/consumer/testimonials_fr.htm |title=Henry Anglade, ancien professionnel de cyclisme et atteint de presbyacousie et \u00e9quip\u00e9 d\u2019un intra-auriculaire Claro |accessdate=2008-11-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330021128/http://www.phonak.fr/ccfr/consumer/testimonials_fr.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}.

However, both are already married; Raymond to a loveless wife and Carla to a domineering petty gangster Greg \"Smithy\" Smith ([[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]]). Ray and Carla plan to leave their respective spouses and run away together, although Ray insists that they delay until he has enough money to ensure a new life together. As a foreman overseeing the construction of a new leisure resort for property developer Gil Hubbard ([[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]]), Ray has been doing underhanded deals with construction worker Barney ([[Kieran Darcy-Smith]]) for the hefty kick-backs which he hopes will eventually land him enough to run off with Carla.\n\nIn the meantime, Ray and Carla are forced to conduct their affair in secret, occasionally made awkward by meeting each other at local events and by Carla's dog periodically escaping and instinctively running to Ray's house to meet his dog. One day, after returning home from work, Carla sees Smithy wiping blood off his hands and stashing a [[money bag|duffel bag full of cash]] into their ceiling; presumably the loot from an armed robbery conducted by Smithy's gang. Carla tells Ray, insisting this to be the end of their financial troubles, and although he is initially hesitant she finally persuades him to steal the money.\n\nRay devises a plan. He will need to burn the house down so Smithy thinks the money was simply destroyed rather than stolen, a job for which he hires the local arsonist, Billy ([[Joel Edgerton]]). Carla will first steal the money from the hiding place and then Billy will arrive and set a fire to make it look as though it was caused by faulty Christmas tree lights.\n\nWhile the whole town is at the Christmas celebration, Carla sneaks back to the house and takes the money from the duffel bag. However, on return she overhears Smithy phoning his mother and asking her to go to his house (the one Billy is planning to burn down) and feed his dog. Carla alerts Ray who quickly tries to ring Billy, but is only able to reach his sister Lily ([[Hanna Mangan-Lawrence]]). With his phone dying, Ray tells Lily to abort the plan but Lily is unable to alert Billy before he leaves. Billy breaks in and sets the fire, unaware of Smithy's mum sleeping on the lounge. Consequently, she dies in the ensuing blaze.\n\nThus things begin to take a downward slide for Ray and Carla. Lily neglects to tell Billy about Ray's call aborting the plan, causing Billy to think he has been duped unwillingly into murdering an old lady. Smithy, devastated by his mother's death, then discovers that the money had, in fact, been stolen, and begins to search ruthlessly for the culprits. And Ray's life is further complicated when someone starts sending him Christmas cards threatening to reveal \"what you're up to\" unless a $10,000 blackmail is paid. What follows is a quickening spiral of murder, suspicion, violence and deceit with shocking consequences for the two lovers and everyone around them. Every time someone discovers something about Ray, they end up dead in some accident caused by Ray trying to stop them. The blackmailer is discovered to be Barney and his wife (who have been scamming people by providing kick-backs and then blackmailing them). Ray goes to Carla's house so they can run off together only to find Billy. Billy demands the rest of his money and Carla gives him the bag full of money she and Ray were going to run away with. As Billy forces Ray and Carla on their knees, Smithy walks in and pulls a gun on Billy. In the fire exchange Smithy is killed and as Ray tries to take the gun from Billy, Carla is shot in the head. Billy leaves as Ray weeps over Carla's body. Ray walks off down the road in shock from the events.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[David Roberts (Australian actor)|David Roberts]] as Raymond Yale\n*[[Claire van der Boom]] as Carla Smith\n*[[Joel Edgerton]] as Billy\n*[[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]] as Greg \"Smithy\" Smith\n*[[Hanna Mangan-Lawrence]] as Lily\n*[[Peter Phelps]] as Jake\n*[[Kieran Darcy-Smith]] as Barney\n*Brendan Donoghue as Leonard Long\n*[[Damon Herriman]] as Eddie\n*[[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Gil Hubbard\n*[[Julian Morrow]] as Dale\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nJoel Edgerton wrote the script in eight years.<ref name=\"d\" /> He said that \"I first wrote \"The Square\" as an idea in my early 20s just, I had notebooks filled with thoughts and ideas about movies I wanted to write, but I never was a writer until I sat down to write a screenplay for Nash. It was this sort of jumbled mess of a thing I was trying to write for him, a crime caper story. As I started writing that, I sort of stopped at one point and started writing \"The Square\" as a different project with no director attached to it. Then at some point, when \"The Square\" started developing its first draft and then at subsequent drafts, I eventually did the old Indiana Jones switcharoo and was like, \"Why don't we just take this script away and put this one in its place because I think this is a more mature project for us to make.\" Thankfully, he felt the same and so we basically put our focus into a new thing and that became The Square.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Joel Edgerton Digs into The Square|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=64854|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in late 2007 at [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]], [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] and [[Caringbah, New South Wales|Caringbah]] the [[suburb]]s of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Director Nash Edgerton and Joel Edgerton Interview THE SQUARE|url=http://collider.com/director-nash-edgerton-and-joel-edgerton-interview-the-square/|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.

However, both are already married; Raymond to a loveless wife and Carla to a domineering petty gangster Greg \"Smithy\" Smith ([[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]]). Ray and Carla plan to leave their respective spouses and run away together, although Ray insists that they delay until he has enough money to ensure a new life together. As a foreman overseeing the construction of a new leisure resort for property developer Gil Hubbard ([[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]]), Ray has been doing underhanded deals with construction worker Barney ([[Kieran Darcy-Smith]]) for the hefty kick-backs which he hopes will eventually land him enough to run off with Carla.\n\nIn the meantime, Ray and Carla are forced to conduct their affair in secret, occasionally made awkward by meeting each other at local events and by Carla's dog periodically escaping and instinctively running to Ray's house to meet his dog. One day, after returning home from work, Carla sees Smithy wiping blood off his hands and stashing a [[money bag|duffel bag full of cash]] into their ceiling; presumably the loot from an armed robbery conducted by Smithy's gang. Carla tells Ray, insisting this to be the end of their financial troubles, and although he is initially hesitant she finally persuades him to steal the money.\n\nRay devises a plan. He will need to burn the house down so Smithy thinks the money was simply destroyed rather than stolen, a job for which he hires the local arsonist, Billy ([[Joel Edgerton]]). Carla will first steal the money from the hiding place and then Billy will arrive and set a fire to make it look as though it was caused by faulty Christmas tree lights.\n\nWhile the whole town is at the Christmas celebration, Carla sneaks back to the house and takes the money from the duffel bag. However, on return she overhears Smithy phoning his mother and asking her to go to his house (the one Billy is planning to burn down) and feed his dog. Carla alerts Ray who quickly tries to ring Billy, but is only able to reach his sister Lily ([[Hanna Mangan-Lawrence]]). With his phone dying, Ray tells Lily to abort the plan but Lily is unable to alert Billy before he leaves. Billy breaks in and sets the fire, unaware of Smithy's mum sleeping on the lounge. Consequently, she dies in the ensuing blaze.\n\nThus things begin to take a downward slide for Ray and Carla. Lily neglects to tell Billy about Ray's call aborting the plan, causing Billy to think he has been duped unwillingly into murdering an old lady. Smithy, devastated by his mother's death, then discovers that the money had, in fact, been stolen, and begins to search ruthlessly for the culprits. And Ray's life is further complicated when someone starts sending him Christmas cards threatening to reveal \"what you're up to\" unless a $10,000 blackmail is paid. What follows is a quickening spiral of murder, suspicion, violence and deceit with shocking consequences for the two lovers and everyone around them. Every time someone discovers something about Ray, they end up dead in some accident caused by Ray trying to stop them. The blackmailer is discovered to be Barney and his wife (who have been scamming people by providing kick-backs and then blackmailing them). Ray goes to Carla's house so they can run off together only to find Billy. Billy demands the rest of his money and Carla gives him the bag full of money she and Ray were going to run away with. As Billy forces Ray and Carla on their knees, Smithy walks in and pulls a gun on Billy. In the fire exchange Smithy is killed and as Ray tries to take the gun from Billy, Carla is shot in the head. Billy leaves as Ray weeps over Carla's body. Ray walks off down the road in shock from the events.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[David Roberts (Australian actor)|David Roberts]] as Raymond Yale\n*[[Claire van der Boom]] as Carla Smith\n*[[Joel Edgerton]] as Billy\n*[[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]] as Greg \"Smithy\" Smith\n*[[Hanna Mangan-Lawrence]] as Lily\n*[[Peter Phelps]] as Jake\n*[[Kieran Darcy-Smith]] as Barney\n*Brendan Donoghue as Leonard Long\n*[[Damon Herriman]] as Eddie\n*[[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Gil Hubbard\n*[[Julian Morrow]] as Dale\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nJoel Edgerton wrote the script in eight years.<ref name=\"d\" /> He said that \"I first wrote \"The Square\" as an idea in my early 20s just, I had notebooks filled with thoughts and ideas about movies I wanted to write, but I never was a writer until I sat down to write a screenplay for Nash. It was this sort of jumbled mess of a thing I was trying to write for him, a crime caper story. As I started writing that, I sort of stopped at one point and started writing \"The Square\" as a different project with no director attached to it. Then at some point, when \"The Square\" started developing its first draft and then at subsequent drafts, I eventually did the old Indiana Jones switcharoo and was like, \"Why don't we just take this script away and put this one in its place because I think this is a more mature project for us to make.\" Thankfully, he felt the same and so we basically put our focus into a new thing and that became The Square.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Joel Edgerton Digs into The Square|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=64854|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in late 2007 at [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]], [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] and [[Caringbah, New South Wales|Caringbah]] the [[suburb]]s of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Director Nash Edgerton and Joel Edgerton Interview THE SQUARE|url=http://collider.com/director-nash-edgerton-and-joel-edgerton-interview-the-square/|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
