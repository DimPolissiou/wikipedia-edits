It consists of seven musical groups, music CDs, live concerts, card games, multiple [[manga]], various [[anime]] television series, and a mobile [[rhythm game]] called ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by developer Craft Egg for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nThe franchise's groups are [[all-female band]]s of five members apiece. The first, Poppin'Party, was created in February 2015 with its members portraying their own characters in the anime and playing their respective personas' instruments in live concerts. Further bands were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh band named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music in addition to singing, while the other bands are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nAlthough the anime has received mixed reviews, the series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game. The project has also expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' revolves around Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meets and befriends four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live! School Idol Festival]]'', a mobile game published by his company.<ref name=\"Kidani interview\">{{cite web|url=https://magnavalon.com/2019/05/19/bang-dream-interview-with-bushiroads-takaaki-kidani-the-path-and-future-of-bang-dream-project-part-1/|title=BanG Dream!

It consists of seven musical groups, music CDs, live concerts, card games, multiple [[manga]], various [[anime]] television series, and a mobile [[rhythm game]] called ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by developer Craft Egg for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nThe franchise's groups are [[all-female band]]s of five members apiece. The first, Poppin'Party, was created in February 2015 with its members portraying their own characters in the anime and playing their respective personas' instruments in live concerts. Further bands were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh band named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music in addition to singing, while the other bands are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nAlthough the anime has received mixed reviews, the series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game. The project has also expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' revolves around Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meets and befriends four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live! School Idol Festival]]'', a mobile game published by his company.<ref name=\"Kidani interview\">{{cite web|url=https://magnavalon.com/2019/05/19/bang-dream-interview-with-bushiroads-takaaki-kidani-the-path-and-future-of-bang-dream-project-part-1/|title=BanG Dream!

It was released on January 31, 2020, through [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Kemosabe Records]]. Announced in late 2019, the album saw the singer once again taking over the role of sole [[executive producer]], following ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017). She collaborated with various songwriters and record producers to achieve her desired sonority, combining elements of her career beginnings and ''Rainbow''. Musically, the record is primarily a [[Pop music|pop]] production, although it encompasses a variety of genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Country music|country]].\n\n''High Road'' was met with polarized reviews from music critics. The singer's reapproach of her partying personality was targeted by both positive and negative evaluations. The album debuted at number seven on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, making it Kesha's fourth top-ten album in the country. It was supported by four singles: \"[[Raising Hell (Kesha song)|Raising Hell]]\" featuring [[Big Freedia]], \"[[My Own Dance]]\", \"[[Resentment (Kesha song)|Resentment]]\", and \"[[Tonight (Kesha song)|Tonight]]\". Kesha will embark on the [[High Road Tour]] to promote the album.\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the release of [[Rainbow (Kesha album)|''Rainbow'']], her third studio album, Kesha issued a new single titled \"[[Rich, White, Straight Men]]\" in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Sarah |title=Kesha Calls Out \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" on New Song |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kesha_calls_out_rich_white_straight_men_on_new_song |website=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-ca |date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> It was initially uploaded onto her [[YouTube]] account on June 2 without prior announcement and was made available in [[online music store]]s and [[Streaming media|streaming]] platforms six days later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pykeren |first1=Sam Van |title=Kesha gets her old weird sparkle back with her new single \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2019/06/keshas-gets-her-old-weird-sparkle-back-with-her-new-single-rich-white-straight-men/ |website=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\u200eRich, White, Straight Men - Single by Kesha |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/rich-white-straight-men-single/1467282032 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rich, White, Straight Men / Kesha |url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/110743402 |website=[[Tidal]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> In September 2019, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] published a cover story about the singer, in which she announced that her fourth studio album was in development and would be released in following December.<ref name=\"Billboard1\">{{cite web |last1=Havens |first1=Lindsey |title=Kesha Is Ready to 'Inspire Joy' -- And Write Huge Pop Songs Again |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8530914/kesha-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the lyrics of the album, Kesha commented that it would be emphasize \"the happiness that I began my career with\", although \"more earned and healthier than ever\".<ref name=\"Billboard1\" /> Musically, it would define a \"full return to Kesha's [[Pop music|pop]] roots, after leaning into a more [[Country music|country]]-[[Soul music|soul]] sound\" in ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"Fader1\">{{cite web |last1=Maicki |first1=Salvatore |title=Kesha\u2019s new album is dropping in December |url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/26/kesha-new-album-december-2019 |website=[[The Fader]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Kesha worked with some previous partners, such as [[Wrabel]], her mother [[Pebe Sebert]], [[Nate Ruess]], who she last worked with on her 2012 single, \"[[Die Young]]\", as well as new collaborators, including [[Justin Tranter]], [[Tayla Parx]], and [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] of [[Imagine Dragons]].<ref name=\"Fader1\"/>\n\nThe record's release date was postponed to January 10 and later to January 31, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heller |first1=Corinne |title=Kesha Refuses to Wallow in ''Tragedy'' Amid Dr. Luke Legal Battle |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095414/why-kesha-refuses-to-wallow-in-tragedy-amid-dr-luke-legal-battle |website=[[E!

It was released on January 31, 2020, through [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Kemosabe Records]]. Announced in late 2019, the album saw the singer once again taking over the role of sole [[executive producer]], following ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017). She collaborated with various songwriters and record producers to achieve her desired sonority, combining elements of her career beginnings and ''Rainbow''. Musically, the record is primarily a [[Pop music|pop]] production, although it encompasses a variety of genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Country music|country]].\n\n''High Road'' was met with polarized reviews from music critics. The singer's reapproach of her partying personality was targeted by both positive and negative evaluations. The album debuted at number seven on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, making it Kesha's fourth top-ten album in the country. It was supported by four singles: \"[[Raising Hell (Kesha song)|Raising Hell]]\" featuring [[Big Freedia]], \"[[My Own Dance]]\", \"[[Resentment (Kesha song)|Resentment]]\", and \"[[Tonight (Kesha song)|Tonight]]\". Kesha will embark on the [[High Road Tour]] to promote the album.\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the release of [[Rainbow (Kesha album)|''Rainbow'']], her third studio album, Kesha issued a new single titled \"[[Rich, White, Straight Men]]\" in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Sarah |title=Kesha Calls Out \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" on New Song |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kesha_calls_out_rich_white_straight_men_on_new_song |website=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-ca |date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> It was initially uploaded onto her [[YouTube]] account on June 2 without prior announcement and was made available in [[online music store]]s and [[Streaming media|streaming]] platforms six days later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pykeren |first1=Sam Van |title=Kesha gets her old weird sparkle back with her new single \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2019/06/keshas-gets-her-old-weird-sparkle-back-with-her-new-single-rich-white-straight-men/ |website=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\u200eRich, White, Straight Men - Single by Kesha |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/rich-white-straight-men-single/1467282032 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rich, White, Straight Men / Kesha |url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/110743402 |website=[[Tidal]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> In September 2019, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] published a cover story about the singer, in which she announced that her fourth studio album was in development and would be released in following December.<ref name=\"Billboard1\">{{cite web |last1=Havens |first1=Lindsey |title=Kesha Is Ready to 'Inspire Joy' -- And Write Huge Pop Songs Again |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8530914/kesha-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the lyrics of the album, Kesha commented that it would be emphasize \"the happiness that I began my career with\", although \"more earned and healthier than ever\".<ref name=\"Billboard1\" /> Musically, it would define a \"full return to Kesha's [[Pop music|pop]] roots, after leaning into a more [[Country music|country]]-[[Soul music|soul]] sound\" in ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"Fader1\">{{cite web |last1=Maicki |first1=Salvatore |title=Kesha\u2019s new album is dropping in December |url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/26/kesha-new-album-december-2019 |website=[[The Fader]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Kesha worked with some previous partners, such as [[Wrabel]], her mother [[Pebe Sebert]], [[Nate Ruess]], who she last worked with on her 2012 single, \"[[Die Young]]\", as well as new collaborators, including [[Justin Tranter]], [[Tayla Parx]], and [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] of [[Imagine Dragons]].<ref name=\"Fader1\"/>\n\nThe record's release date was postponed to January 10 and later to January 31, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heller |first1=Corinne |title=Kesha Refuses to Wallow in ''Tragedy'' Amid Dr. Luke Legal Battle |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095414/why-kesha-refuses-to-wallow-in-tragedy-amid-dr-luke-legal-battle |website=[[E!

Club]]''{{'s}} Annie Zaleski praised the album for its musical diversity and lyrical and emotional depth.<ref name=\"AVClubReview\"/> Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine|''Slant'']] also praised the album's sentimental approach, despite labeling it as Kesha's \"least consistent\" album due to the variety of music genres.<ref name=\"SlantReview\"/> Nick Lowe of ''Clash'' complimented it for not sounding forced despite its versatility, writing that Kesha \"searches deep and emancipates the embodiment of sheer delight\".<ref name=\"ClashReview\"/> Writing for [[DIY (magazine)|''DIY'']], Elly Watson defined the album as an \"overwhelmingly triumphant pop offering that sees Kesha back at her best and having shit tons of fun while doing it\".<ref name=\"DIYReview\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} Aimee Cliff recognized the album as derived from the singer's early works with a \"new sense of underlying self-awareness\".<ref name=\"TheGuardianReview\"/> Focusing on the same topic, Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Kesha's return to her party persona.<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] and Louise Bruton of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' particularly praised \"My Own Dance\" and Kesha's lyrical duplicity.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/><ref name=\"IrishTimesReview\"/>\n\nIn a more mixed evaluation, Megan Buerger of ''[[Pitchfork]]'' summarized ''High Road'' as a setback following ''Rainbow'', affirming that it \"feels strained, scattershot, and loaded with tension, like someone trying to portray freedom and free-spiritedness\u2014even a recovered sense of identity\u2014who isn\u2019t quite there yet\". She also criticized the album's premise, commenting that \"it doesn\u2019t feel like moving on, it feels like running away\".<ref name=\"PitchforkReview\"/> Similarly, ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'s}} Nick Malone discredited Kesha's attempts to unite the diverse sounds with which she has worked throughout her career and even devalued the investment to return to Kesha's partying identity. He compared Kesha's  concern with her audience's perception of herself to [[Miley Cyrus]]'s fifth studio album ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]''.<ref name=\"PopMattersReview\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 48:33\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title1 = [[Tonight (Kesha song)|Tonight]]\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Kesha|Kesha Sebert]]|[[Wrabel|Stephen Wrabel]]|[[Stint (producer)|Ajay Bhattacharya]]}}\n| extra1 = [[Stint (producer)|Stint]]\n| length1 = 3:15\n\n| title2 = [[My Own Dance]]\n| writer2 = {{hlist|K.

The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[Rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors|rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingleplayer game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by [[Cutscene|dialogue]] and [[Full motion video|FMVs]], \"Chronicles,\" a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game also features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are also able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas also allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]<nowiki/>s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot and Setting==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}===\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth.The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\nSignificant additions have been made to the story since the plot points above were released, and this article can not claim to contain the newest chapters or a significant part of the story.\n\n==Characters==\nThere are many characters within the game's story, but the most commonly encountered characters are the Valkyries that the player can control.\n\n===Valkyries===\nValkyries are the playable characters in the game, most having multiple \"battlesuits\" of the character with each battlesuit having types, abilities, stats, skills, and costume that make each battlesuit different. The game says that Valkyries start off as girls with remarkable Honkai resistance. They are then recruited by Schicksal and given training to become super-human soldiers tasked with fighting the Honkai and defending humanity. The player starts the game as the Captain leading the Squad V Valkyries of the Far East Branch.\n\n;\n;{{Nihongo|Kiana Kaslana|\u30ad\u30a2\u30ca\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30e9\u30ca|Kiana Kasurana}}\n:{{Voiced by|Dian Tao ([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%99%B6%E5%85%B8 \u9676\u5178]) (Chinese); [[Rie Kugimiya]] (Japanese)}}\n:Kiana Kaslana is a young, brash, and sometimes absent-minded Valkyrie and serves as the protagonist of the ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' story.

The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[Rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors|rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingleplayer game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by [[Cutscene|dialogue]] and [[Full motion video|FMVs]], \"Chronicles,\" a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game also features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are also able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas also allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]<nowiki/>s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot and Setting==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}===\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth.The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\nSignificant additions have been made to the story since the plot points above were released, and this article can not claim to contain the newest chapters or a significant part of the story.\n\n==Characters==\nThere are many characters within the game's story, but the most commonly encountered characters are the Valkyries that the player can control.\n\n===Valkyries===\nValkyries are the playable characters in the game, most having multiple \"battlesuits\" of the character with each battlesuit having types, abilities, stats, skills, and costume that make each battlesuit different. The game says that Valkyries start off as girls with remarkable Honkai resistance. They are then recruited by Schicksal and given training to become super-human soldiers tasked with fighting the Honkai and defending humanity. The player starts the game as the Captain leading the Squad V Valkyries of the Far East Branch.\n\n;\n;{{Nihongo|Kiana Kaslana|\u30ad\u30a2\u30ca\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30e9\u30ca|Kiana Kasurana}}\n:{{Voiced by|Dian Tao ([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%99%B6%E5%85%B8 \u9676\u5178]) (Chinese); [[Rie Kugimiya]] (Japanese)}}\n:Kiana Kaslana is a young, brash, and sometimes absent-minded Valkyrie and serves as the protagonist of the ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' story.

The fail-safe disassembly prevents the disassembly lever from being manipulated when there is a magazine in the pistol. Conversely, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol. This model, at only {{convert|1|in|mm}} wide and initially available only in .45 ACP, is specifically designed for [[concealed carry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xdspistol.com|title=Springfield Armory - Handguns, Pistols, Semi Automatic Rifles|work=Springfield Armory|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> The .45 ACP XD-S has a 5+1 capacity (with optional 6+1 and 7+1 magazines) and a {{convert|3.3|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel. In January 2013, an  XD-S chambered in [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (9mm) was introduced. It is the same as the .45 ACP model, the only difference being that the 9mm XD-S has a 7+1 capacity (with optional 8+1 and 9+1 magazines) and is marginally heavier due to a smaller barrel bore. The XD-S in 9mm was named \"Handgun of the Year\" by ''American Rifleman'' for 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2012/12/14/2013-golden-bullseye-winners/ |title=2013 Golden Bullseye Winners |website=americanrifleman.org |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Springfield Armory unveiled the '''XD Mod.2''', increasing their XD lineup to 33 offerings. The XD Mod.2 includes ergonomic improvements, the most notable of which is the \"Grip Zone\"; three differently textured areas on the grip, each with their own unique texturing, in contrast to the original XD design with traditional grip texturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/01/get-springfield-xd-mod-2-grip-zone/ |title=Get Into the Springfield XD Mod.2 Grip Zone |first=Dennis |last=Adler |website=personaldefenseworld.com |date=January 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> The pistol also has a new set of [[Iron sights|sights]].

It is the same as the .45 ACP model, the only difference being that the 9mm XD-S has a 7+1 capacity (with optional 8+1 and 9+1 magazines) and is marginally heavier due to a smaller barrel bore.

He had fled to the then Spanish colony of Louisiana to escape prosecution, and became involved in various land deals. In [[New Spain]], he falsely claimed to be a nobleman. He received a large grant of land, provided that he could settle 450 families on it over the next several years.  However, he was unable to do this, and so lost the grant.  Afterwards, he moved to Texas, where he claimed to oppose the sale of Louisiana to the United States and became a minor government official.  He proved instrumental in [[Moses Austin|Moses Austin's]] plan (and later, that of his son, [[Stephen F. Austin]]) to bring American colonists to what was then northern Mexico.\n\nBastrop formally incorporated in 1857, and is the commercial and industrial center of [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]]. In the 19th century, it was notable as the western edge of the great north Louisiana swamp, but more favorable terrain resulted in the antebellum rail line connecting to [[Monroe, Louisiana]], further to the south.\n\nBastrop was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold during the [[American Civil War]] until January 1865, when 3,000 cavalrymen led by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] E.D. Osband of the Third U.S. Colored Cavalry, embarked from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for northeastern Louisiana. Landing first in southeastern [[Arkansas]], Osband and his men began foraging for supplies into Louisiana and established headquarters at Bastrop. They brought in a large number of horses, mules, and [[Negro]]es, according to the historian [[John D. Winters]] in ''The Civil War in Louisiana.'' When Osband learned that Confederate Colonel A.J. McNeill was camped near [[Oak Ridge, Louisiana|Oak Ridge]] in Morehouse Parish with 800 men, he sent a brigade into the area. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops found fewer than 60 Confederates, most of whom fled into the swamps, leaving behind horses and mules.*<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, pp. 413\u2013414</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], Bastrop was the site of a relief camp for refugees. During [[World War II]], it was the site of German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp.\n\n[[File:Morehouse Parish Courthouse, Bastrop, LA IMG 2803.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Morehouse Parish Courthouse]]\nBastrop is also the parish seat of Morehouse Parish and is within an area marketed to tourists as the Sportsman's Paradise Region of Louisiana. It is a Main Street Community and has received Transportation Enhancement funding for improvements in its historic district.<ref name=\"preserveamerica.gov\">http://www.preserveamerica.gov/PAcommunity-bastropLA.html</ref>\n\nCelebrations and concerts are held in the historic downtown at the restored 1914 Morehouse Parish Courthouse and Rose Theater. Bastrop is home to the Snyder Museum and Creative Arts Center, housed in the circa 1929 home of a local family. Volunteers lead heritage appreciation tours for children and interpret the history of the parish using local artifacts.<ref name=\"preserveamerica.gov\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nThe Bastrop area economy is largely based on forestry, cotton and rice farming, and potato shipping. Hunting, camping, and fishing are pastimes in the many bayous and rivers. Shopping is also a popular tourist attraction in the area. The Snyder Museum keeps information relating to local history and displays furniture typical of fine homes from the Civil War and early 20th century periods.\n\nBarham's Drugs on the courthouse square in Bastrop was formerly owned and operated by Henry Alfred Barham, Jr. (1919-1993), and his wife, the former Ann Jocelyn Heres (1929-2015). Mrs. Barham, originally educated in [[home economics]] at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], was the first woman pharmacist in Morehouse Parish and a graduate of the pharmacy school at the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]].

I don't want to sugarcoat this. There would have to be a dramatic change in the world economy for it to reopen, and it would have to strengthen as quickly as it weakened.\" Jindal said the state offered \"more direct assistance to International Paper than we have to any other company since I've been governor.\" The company, however, explained that the issue was no longer one of inducements to stay but the vanished market.

They'll probably have to resort to dope slinging, stealing, and murder for money now.\"<ref name=pilpr/>\n\nThen Bastrop Mayor Clarence Hawkins estimated about five hundred, or nearly half of the Pilgrim's Pride processing plant workers in Farmerville commuted from Bastrop, many in vans running on a regular schedule.<ref name=pilpr/>\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Jindal and the legislature, in a bid to save the jobs at stake, moved to subsidize with $50 million from the state's megafund the incoming owner of the poultry plant, [[Foster Farms (poultry company)|Foster Farms]] of California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brac.org/site.php?pageID=59&newsID=1026 |title=BRAC in the News: Blanco argues against use of megafund |publisher=Brac.org |accessdate=May 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918224719/http://brac.org/site.php?pageID=59&newsID=1026 |archivedate=September 18, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nWith Louisiana state assistance, Foster Farms did procure the former Pilgrim's Pride company, which also closed plants in [[Farmerville, Louisiana|Farmerville]], Louisiana, and [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]], Arkansas.

CEO Chuck Davis traveled to Morehouse Parish, Louisiana to announce plans to build a wood pellet facility in Bastrop and a storage-and-shipping facility at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. The project was completed and the plant was commissioned in 2015 adding 79 new direct jobs, with 64 of the jobs located at the Bastrop wood pellet facility. LED estimates the project generated an additional 150 indirect jobs in the state. Drax' budget for the Morehouse mill was about $120 million. Drax says the average pay plus benefits averages more than $35,000 annually at the pellet mill. Drax is shipping wood pellets formed in Morehouse Parish to its U.K. Energy facilities for use in generating renewable power. July, 2013, Drax Biomass started work on clearing the area for the new wood-based pellet facility in Bastrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://draxbiomass.com/news-media/news-updates/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219081227/http://draxbiomass.com/news-media/news-updates/ |archivedate=February 19, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n<ref>http://www.thepineywoods.com/PelletsJan13.html/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBastrop is located at {{Coord|32|46|40|N|91|54|54|W|type:city}} (32.777855, \u221291.914944).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  It is situated at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 425 and U.S. Highway 165.

Alford-Olive, who completed two terms on the city council, called her victory a sign that people want change in municipal government. \"We hope to get small businesses to grow and involve the banking industry. We have to look at where the economy is emerging. We have to make sure we have a trained work force.\" Hawkins had been the first African-American to serve in the top municipal position in Bastrop history.<ref>Matthew Hamilton, \"Alford-Olive unseats Hawkins in Bastrop upset\", ''Monroe News-Star'', April 5, 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Arthur Jones, the former long-term Bastrop municipal recreation director, narrowly unseated Alford-Olive.

He had fled to the then Spanish colony of Louisiana to escape prosecution, and became involved in various land deals. In [[New Spain]], he falsely claimed to be a nobleman. He received a large grant of land, provided that he could settle 450 families on it over the next several years.  However, he was unable to do this, and so lost the grant.  Afterwards, he moved to Texas, where he claimed to oppose the sale of Louisiana to the United States and became a minor government official.  He proved instrumental in [[Moses Austin|Moses Austin's]] plan (and later, that of his son, [[Stephen F. Austin]]) to bring American colonists to what was then northern Mexico.\n\nBastrop formally incorporated in 1857, and is the commercial and industrial center of [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]]. In the 19th century, it was notable as the western edge of the great north Louisiana swamp, but more favorable terrain resulted in the antebellum rail line connecting to [[Monroe, Louisiana]], further to the south.\n\nBastrop was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold during the [[American Civil War]] until January 1865, when 3,000 cavalrymen led by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] E.D. Osband of the Third U.S. Colored Cavalry, embarked from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for northeastern Louisiana. Landing first in southeastern [[Arkansas]], Osband and his men began foraging for supplies into Louisiana and established headquarters at Bastrop. They brought in a large number of horses, mules, and [[Negro]]es, according to the historian [[John D. Winters]] in ''The Civil War in Louisiana.'' When Osband learned that Confederate Colonel A.J. McNeill was camped near [[Oak Ridge, Louisiana|Oak Ridge]] in Morehouse Parish with 800 men, he sent a brigade into the area. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops found fewer than 60 Confederates, most of whom fled into the swamps, leaving behind horses and mules.*<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, pp. 413\u2013414</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], Bastrop was the site of a relief camp for refugees. During [[World War II]], it was the site of German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp.\n\n[[File:Morehouse Parish Courthouse, Bastrop, LA IMG 2803.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Morehouse Parish Courthouse]]\nBastrop is also the parish seat of Morehouse Parish and is within an area marketed to tourists as the Sportsman's Paradise Region of Louisiana. It is a Main Street Community and has received Transportation Enhancement funding for improvements in its historic district.<ref name=\"preserveamerica.gov\">http://www.preserveamerica.gov/PAcommunity-bastropLA.html</ref>\n\nCelebrations and concerts are held in the historic downtown at the restored 1914 Morehouse Parish Courthouse and Rose Theater. Bastrop is home to the Snyder Museum and Creative Arts Center, housed in the circa 1929 home of a local family. Volunteers lead heritage appreciation tours for children and interpret the history of the parish using local artifacts.<ref name=\"preserveamerica.gov\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nThe Bastrop area economy is largely based on forestry, cotton and rice farming, and potato shipping. Hunting, camping, and fishing are pastimes in the many bayous and rivers. Shopping is also a popular tourist attraction in the area. The Snyder Museum keeps information relating to local history and displays furniture typical of fine homes from the Civil War and early 20th century periods.\n\nBarham's Drugs on the courthouse square in Bastrop was formerly owned and operated by Henry Alfred Barham, Jr. (1919-1993), and his wife, the former Ann Jocelyn Heres (1929-2015). Mrs. Barham, originally educated in [[home economics]] at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], was the first woman pharmacist in Morehouse Parish and a graduate of the pharmacy school at the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]].

Jindal indicated that he will pursue an economic transition plan for Morehouse Parish. The governor explained that the closure resulted because is \"simply no market for [pulp] produced at this mill. I don't want to sugarcoat this. There would have to be a dramatic change in the world economy for it to reopen, and it would have to strengthen as quickly as it weakened.\" Jindal said the state offered \"more direct assistance to International Paper than we have to any other company since I've been governor.\" The company, however, explained that the issue was no longer one of inducements to stay but the vanished market. The largest customer of the Louisiana mill was China, where orders ceased with international economic downturns and the tightening of credit markets.<ref>Greg Hilburn, [http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20081125/NEWS01/811250309&referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL \"Jindal: Bastrop is a top priority: State will do all it can to prop up community\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816210041/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20081125/NEWS01/811250309%26referrer%3DFRONTPAGECAROUSEL |date=August 16, 2014  }}, ''Monroe News Star'', November 25, 2008</ref>\n\n===Poultry plant shutdowns affect Bastrop===\nThree months after the announcement of the International Paper mill closing, [[Pilgrim's Pride]], a poultry company, confirmed the closure of operations in nearby [[Arcadia, Louisiana|Arcadia]] in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]], [[Athens, Louisiana|Athens]] in [[Claiborne Parish]], [[Choudrant, Louisiana|Choudrant]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]], and [[Farmerville, Louisiana|Farmerville]] in [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]].

In our area, there aren't a lot of good alternative opportunities for them and they don't have as many resources to leave the area for opportunity as did the workers at those other companies.

CEO Chuck Davis traveled to Morehouse Parish, Louisiana to announce plans to build a wood pellet facility in Bastrop and a storage-and-shipping facility at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. The project was completed and the plant was commissioned in 2015 adding 79 new direct jobs, with 64 of the jobs located at the Bastrop wood pellet facility. LED estimates the project generated an additional 150 indirect jobs in the state. Drax' budget for the Morehouse mill was about $120 million. Drax says the average pay plus benefits averages more than $35,000 annually at the pellet mill. Drax is shipping wood pellets formed in Morehouse Parish to its U.K. Energy facilities for use in generating renewable power.
