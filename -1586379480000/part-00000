An early example is the invention of [[language]], which enabled a person, through [[speech]], to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of [[writing]], which converted spoken language into [[visual system|visual]] [[symbol]]s, extended the range of communication across [[space]] and [[time]].\n\nThe process of '''encoding''' converts information from a [[communication source|source]] into symbols for communication or storage. '''Decoding''' is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or Spanish.\n\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary [[plain language]], spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, [[semaphore]], where the configuration of [[Flag semaphore|flags]] held by a signaler or the arms of a [[semaphore line|semaphore tower]] encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.\n\n== Theory ==\n{{main|Coding theory}}\nIn [[information theory]] and [[computer science]], a code is usually considered as an [[algorithm]] that uniquely represents [[symbols]] from some source [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], by ''encoded'' strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.\n\nBefore giving a mathematically precise definition, this is a brief example. The mapping\n:<math>C = \\{\\, a\\mapsto 0, b\\mapsto 01, c\\mapsto 011\\,\\}</math>\nis a code, whose source alphabet is the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> and whose target alphabet is the set <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001011 can be grouped into codewords as 0\u2002011\u20020\u200201\u2002011, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols ''acabc''.\n\nUsing terms from [[formal language theory]], the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]], respectively. A '''code''' <math>C:\\, S \\to T^*</math> is a [[total function]] mapping each symbol from S to a [[String (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] over T, and the extension of <math>C</math> to a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms and e-free homomorphisms in formal language theory|homomorphism]] of <math>S^*</math> into <math>T^*</math>, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its '''extension'''.\n\n=== Variable-length codes ===\n{{main|Variable-length code}}\nCodes that encode each source (clear text) character by a [[code word]] from some dictionary, and [[concatenation]] of such code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also [[entropy encoding]].\n\nA ''prefix code'' is a code with the \"prefix property\": there is no valid code word in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (start) of any other valid code word in the set. [[Huffman coding]] is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as \"Huffman codes\" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA|WCDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard.\n\n[[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessary a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.\n\n=== Error-correcting codes ===\n{{main|Error detection and correction}}\n{{see also|Block code}}\nCodes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage. This so-called [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting code]] works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include [[Hamming code]]s, [[Reed\u2013Solomon]], [[Reed\u2013Muller code|Reed\u2013Muller]], [[Walsh\u2013Hadamard code|Walsh\u2013Hadamard]], [[BCH code|Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hochquenghem]], [[Turbo code|Turbo]], [[Binary Golay code|Golay]], [[Goppa code|Goppa]], [[low-density parity-check code]]s, and [[space\u2013time code]]s.\nError detecting codes can be optimised to detect ''burst errors'', or ''random errors''.\n\n\n\n\n\u04e3\u0495\u04e3\u0445\u05e6\u05d0\u05d9\u00a7\u2205\u0643\u0643\u0636\u0623\u012f\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Codes in communication used for brevity ===\nA cable code replaces words (e.g. ''ship'' or ''invoice'') with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer [[character (computing)|characters]], more quickly, and less expensively.\n\nCodes can be used for brevity. When [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] messages were the state of the art in rapid long-distance communication, elaborate systems of [[commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were developed, so that telegraphers became conversant with such \"words\" as ''BYOXO'' (\"Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?\"), ''LIOUY'' (\"Why do you not answer my question?\"), ''BMULD'' (\"You're a skunk!\"), or ''AYYLU'' (\"Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.\"). [[Code word]]s were chosen for various reasons: [[length]], [[pronounceability]], etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American [[Black Chamber]] run by [[Herbert Yardley]] between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for [[data compression]] predates the computer era; an early example is the telegraph [[Morse code]] where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as [[Huffman coding]] are now used by computer-based [[algorithm]]s to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission. Example of a code: \n\n\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude27 say_hi(name):\n    # will say 'Hi' to you a couple of times\n    \n      for_in range(10):\n         print(' '.join(['Hi', name]))\n         \nsay_hi('Checki0')\n\n=== Character encodings ===\n{{Main|Character encoding}}\nCharacter encodings are representations of textual data. A given character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there are single byte encodings, [[Wide character|multibyte]] (also called wide) encodings, and [[Variable-width encoding|variable-width]] (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte, the best known example of which is [[ASCII]]. ASCII remains in use today, for example in [[HTTP headers]]. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 characters. Scripts which require large character sets such as [[CJK|Chinese, Japanese and Korean]] must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters used the same number of bytes (\"word length\"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining backwards compatibility properties. This group includes [[UTF-8]], an encoding of the [[Unicode]] character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.\n\n=== Genetic code ===\n{{Main|Genetic code}}\n[[Biology|Biological]] organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development. This is [[DNA]], which contains units named [[gene]]s from which [[messenger RNA]] is derived. This in turn produces [[protein]]s through a [[genetic code]] in which a series of triplets ([[codon]]s) of four possible [[nucleotides]] can be translated into one of twenty possible [[amino acid]]s. A sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein molecule; a type of codon called a [[stop codon]] signals the end of the sequence.\n\n===G\u00f6del code===\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[G\u00f6del code]] was the basis for the proof of [[G\u00f6del]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]]. Here, the idea was to map [[mathematical notation]] to a [[natural number]] (using a [[G\u00f6del numbering]]).\n\n=== Other ===\nThere are codes using colors, like [[traffic lights]], the [[Electronic color code|color code]] employed to mark the nominal value of the [[Resistor|electrical resistor]]s or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage (paper, glass, organic, etc.).\n\nIn [[marketing]], [[coupon]] codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from a (usually internet) retailer.\n\nIn military environments, specific sounds with the [[cornet]] are used for different uses: to mark some moments of the day, to command the infantry on the battlefield, etc.\n\nCommunication systems for sensory impairments, such as [[sign language]] for deaf people and [[braille]] for blind people, are based on movement or tactile codes.\n\n[[Sheet music|Musical scores]] are the most common way to encode [[music]].\n\nSpecific games have their own code systems to record the matches, e.g. [[chess notation]].\n\n=== Cryptography ===\nIn the [[history of cryptography]], [[Code (cryptography)|codes]] were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications, although [[cipher]]s are now used instead.\n\nSecret codes intended to obscure the real messages, ranging from serious (mainly [[espionage]] in military, diplomacy, business, etc.) to trivial (romance, games) can be any kind of imaginative encoding: [[Language of flowers|flowers]], game cards, clothes, fans, hats, melodies, birds, etc., in which the sole requisite is the pre-agreement on the meaning by both the sender and the receiver.\n\n== Other examples ==\nOther examples of encoding include:\n*Encoding (in [[cognition]]) - a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g., light, sound) into subjectively meaningful experience.\n*A [[content format]] - a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of [[data]] to [[information]].\n*Text encoding uses a [[markup language]] to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers. (See also [[Text Encoding Initiative]].)\n*[[Semantics encoding]] of formal language A in formal language B is a method of representing all terms (e.g. programs or descriptions) of language A using language B.\n*[[Data compression]] transforms a signal into a code optimized for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or [[data storage device|storage]], generally done with a [[codec]].\n*[[Neural encoding]] - the way in which information is represented in [[neuron]]s.\n*[[Memory encoding]] - the process of converting sensations into memories.\n*[[Television encoding]]: [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]]\n\nOther examples of decoding include:\n* [[Parsing|Decoding (computer science)]]\n* [[Decoding methods]], methods in communication theory for decoding code words sent over a noisy channel\n* [[Digital signal processing]], the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals\n* [[Digital-to-analog converter]], the use of analog circuit for decoding operations\n* Word decoding, the use of [[phonics]] to decipher print patterns and translate them into the sounds of language\n\n==Codes and acronyms==\n[[Acronym]]s and abbreviations can be considered codes, and in a sense all [[language]]s and [[writing system]]s are codes for human thought.\n\n[[International Air Transport Association airport code]]s are three-letter codes used to designate airports and used for [[bag tag]]s. [[Station code]]s are similarly used on railways, but are usually national, so the same code can be used for different stations if they are in different countries.\n\nOccasionally, a code word achieves an independent existence (and meaning) while the original equivalent phrase is forgotten or at least no longer has the precise meaning attributed to the code word. For example, '30' was widely used in [[journalism]] to mean \"end of story\", and has been used in [[-30-|other contexts]] to signify \"the end\".<ref>Kogan, Hadass [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4408 \"So Why Not 29\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212101705/http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4408 |date=2010-12-12 }} American Journalism Review.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Billericay (UK Parliament constituency)|Billericay]] (1966\u201370) and [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]] (1974\u201379).\n\nMoonman was educated at [[Liverpool University|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester University|Manchester Universities]] and became a senior research fellow in the Department of Management Science at Manchester University. He was a councillor on [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney Borough Council]], serving as Council Leader until 1965, and on the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] from 1964.\n\nMoonman contested [[Chigwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Chigwell]] in 1964 without success and was elected for Billericay in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]], losing the seat four years later. He then was elected for [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]] at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], but again lost his seat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].\n\nAfter his second electoral defeat, Moonman pursued an academic career, and became Professor of Management at [[City University, London]] and senior fellow, [[University of Liverpool]].\n\nMoonman was chair of [[Poale Zion (Great Britain)]] and president of [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>[http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1955_jc_editor_criticised.htm Something Jewish], 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.jta.org/1977/11/08/archive/eric-moonman-has-been-re-elected-chairman-of-the Jewish Telegraphic Agency], 1977</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nEric Moonman was born in [[Liverpool]] on 29 April 1929 to Borach and Leah Moonman.<ref name=\"Debrett 2007\">''Debrett's People of Today'' (Debrett's Peerage Ltd, 2007)</ref> He attended Rathbone School in Liverpool which he left at the age of 13 to begin a seven-year apprenticeship at WJ Pugh Printers and then the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]''.<ref>Inprofile: Eric Moonman, [http://www.liv.ac.uk/insight/2004autumn.pdf \"Insight\" August 2004 Second Issue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051207115434/http://www.liv.ac.uk/insight/2004autumn.pdf |date=7 December 2005 }}</ref> After the war, Moonman undertook his national service in the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Liverpool Regiment]] from 1951 to 1953, during which he took courses in military studies as well as evening classes in subjects such as public speaking. In 1954 he gained a place at the [[University of Liverpool]] to study for a Diploma in Social Science. At Liverpool, he edited the University magazine and became chairman of the Labour Society. Moonman was awarded his diploma in 1955.\n\n==After Parliament==\n===Work on Israel===\nIn June 1967, the Foreign Secretary [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] made a speech to the UN General Assembly on the Israel-Arab Conflict. Moonman was one of a number of Labour MPs to accuse Brown of \"taking sides\" against Israel. At a Jewish ex-servicemen's rally in Southend, Moonman called Brown's speech a \"serious embarrassment\" and said he had \"aggressively departed\" from the Government's neutral policy, giving \"harsh and arrogant advice\" to the Israelis.<ref>Philip Rawstone, 'MPs accuse Mr Brown of 'taking sides'', ''Guardian'', 23 June 1967</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Moonman was at the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Switzerland. He approached Stephen Roth, then director of the [[European Jewish Congress]], and told him that changes had to be made in the way that Israel represented itself abroad. Roth accordingly gave him permission to start up a commission on Israel. In 1974, Moonman convened the first gathering of Jewish professionals to work out propaganda strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greer Fay Cashman, \u2018Selling Israel\u2019, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 26 November 1990</ref>\n\nThe group subsequently met twice every year, once in Europe in the summer and once in Jerusalem in the autumn. Moonman was \u201cthe founder and guiding light\u201d of the organisation which became the West European Public Relations Group for Information on Behalf of Israel. The group was initially funded by the [[World Jewish Congress]] which later withdrew its funding. From 1980 it was funded instead by the [[World Zionist Organization]] and from 1985 also by the Israel Foreign Ministry.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Register of Members' Interests 1975/6 records that Moonman visited a conference in Brussels in February 1976, which was probably the winter meeting of the West European Public Relations Group for Information on Behalf of Israel. The register records that Moonman was there as a representative of the Parliamentary Committee for the release of Soviet Jewry.<ref>Register of Members' Interests as on 26 May 1976</ref>\n\nBy 1975, Moonman was chairman of the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation of Great Britain]].<ref>Eric Silver, 'Rabin rejects rebel settlers' plea', ''Guardian'', 6 December 1975</ref> In August that year he met with the Home Secretary [[Roy Jenkins]] to protest against the planned visit to London by two members of the [[Palestinian National Council]] (the political wing of the [[PLO]]). Moonman criticised the visit as \"an attempt to become respectable\". He added \"we demean ourselves as human beings if at a convenient point of time we overlook the track record of these people\".<ref>Peter Niesewand, 'More protests at PLO visit', ''Guardian'', 11 August 1975</ref>\n\nIn June 1977, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published a front-page story and a four-page \u2018Insight\u2019 investigation reporting the alleged torture of Palestinian prisoners in the occupied territories. The Israeli Embassy in London called the assertions a \"vicious slander as it is insulting to the only democracy and free judiciary in the area\".<ref>\u2018Israel denies torture of Arab prisoners\u2019 ''The Times'', 20 June 1977; pg. 1; Issue 60034; col A</ref> Moonman made three complaints about the reports to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]], complaining that unproved accusations were reported as facts, that the paper misled readers with unsubstantiated quotes and headlines, and that Israel was denied the opportunity to comment before publication. His complaints were rejected.<ref>\u2018Torture complaint rejected\u2019, ''Observer'', 15 October 1978, p.3</ref>\n\nIn 1981 a broadcast by the Israeli ''Radio Peace and Progress'' (summarised by the BBC) referred to Moonman as one of several \"leaders of the Zionist organizations in Britain\"; although it is not clear if this referred to the West European Public Relations Group for Information on Behalf of Israel or another organisation. The broadcast reported that Moonman had \"explained his\" opposition to [[Menachem Begin]] in an article in ''The Jewish Chronicle'', wherein Moonman argued that: \"We must support Israel, but we must give consideration to the image of the Israel which we support. It is clear that Israel's Western allies are less and less interested in supporting Begin's Israel\".<ref>SOURCE: Text of commentary ''Radio Peace and Progress'' in Hebrew 1800 gmt 4 Aug 81, BBC Summary of World Broadcasts 7 August 1981</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Moonman forced the editor of the ''[[Jewish Quarterly]]'' to resign. According to his successor Colin Shindler: \"The offence had been caused by a ''Jewish Quarterly'' editorial which questioned the actual dangers of anti-Semitism today as popularly viewed by Jewish leadership\".<ref>Colin Shindler, \u2018Media: New Moon's guiding light - Colin Shindler on a magazine aiming to attract a generation of disaffected Jews\u2019, The Guardian, 10 \nSeptember 1990</ref>\n\nA 1986 report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' refers to Moonman as \"chairman of the research committee of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]\",<ref>Walter Schwarz, \u201825 per cent fewer Jews\u2019, ''The Guardian'', 23 July 1986</ref> and Moonman's profile in ''Debrett's People of Today'' states that that year he was appointed senior vice-president.<ref name=\"Debrett 2007\"/> At this stage, Moonman was also a board member of the British-Israel Public Affairs Committee (BIPAC) where he worked on a publication called ''EEC Monitor''. In 1987, however he was forced to resign from BIPAC after a financial scandal which he considered the result of a campaign against him. Below is an extract from ''The Guardian'' explaining the circumstances of Moonman's departure from BIPAC:\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:beige; border:1pt solid Darkgoldenrod; padding:1%;\">An unusual advert has just appeared in ''The Jewish Chronicle'', asking anyone who knows about a campaign of malice against the former Labour MP Eric Moonman to send the information to a box number. It has been placed, of course, by Moonman himself, who is senior vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and chairman of the Islington Area Health Authority in London. Until recently he was also a board member of the British-Israel Public Affairs Committee (BIPAC), but he resigned at the last meeting following what might be called the Alexander Keddie Affair. Keddie doesn't actually exist, although he was once described as a recluse in Essex who didn't like taking phone calls; the name was simply used over a period of about four years to steer payments to a variety of people, including Moonman, who worked on a BIPAC publication called EEC Monitor. An accountant's report into the affair was prompted by Monty Summary, a prominent Jewish businessman and fundraiser, and it concluded that Moonman had left people confused about the Keddie arrangement. Moonman denies this, and is now intent on unmasking his putative tormentors. 'I do think there is a campaign against me,' he said this week. 'There have been anonymous letters and phone calls as well.'\u201d<ref>Stephen Cook, \u2018People Diary\u2019, ''The Guardian'', 9 October 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 2001, Moonman had joined the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In mid January 2002, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' reported that he headed the Zionist Federation's Media Response Unit; organising email and letter writing campaigns against journalists perceived to be antisemitic or critical of Israel.<ref>Dennis Sewell, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200201140009 \u2018A kosher conspiracy?\u2019], ''New Statesman'', 14 January 2002</ref> A week after the publishing of that article, Moonman had reportedly become President of the organisation.<ref>Inigo Gilmore and Adam Lusher, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1382093/Harrods-incurs-Jewish-anger-by-removing-Israeli-goods.html \u2018Harrods incurs Jewish anger by removing Israeli goods\u2019], \"Sunday Telegraph\", 20 January 2002</ref>\n\n===Terrorism expert===\nMoonman's emergence as a terrorism expert seems to have stemmed from his involvement in an organisation called the Centre for Contemporary Studies, a think-tank which published material on football hooliganism and race relations, as well as terrorism. The Centre appears to have been founded by Moonman who seems to have been affected by the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riots]] and anxious about the possibility of societal breakdown.\n\nIn May 1981, the Centre published a report called \"The Nazis are in the Playground\".

He was a councillor on [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney Borough Council]], serving as Council Leader until 1965, and on the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] from 1964.\n\nMoonman contested [[Chigwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Chigwell]] in 1964 without success and was elected for Billericay in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]], losing the seat four years later. He then was elected for [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]] at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], but again lost his seat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].\n\nAfter his second electoral defeat, Moonman pursued an academic career, and became Professor of Management at [[City University, London]] and senior fellow, [[University of Liverpool]].\n\nMoonman was chair of [[Poale Zion (Great Britain)]] and president of [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>[http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1955_jc_editor_criticised.htm Something Jewish], 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.jta.org/1977/11/08/archive/eric-moonman-has-been-re-elected-chairman-of-the Jewish Telegraphic Agency], 1977</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nEric Moonman was born in [[Liverpool]] on 29 April 1929 to Borach and Leah Moonman.<ref name=\"Debrett 2007\">''Debrett's People of Today'' (Debrett's Peerage Ltd, 2007)</ref> He attended Rathbone School in Liverpool which he left at the age of 13 to begin a seven-year apprenticeship at WJ Pugh Printers and then the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]''.<ref>Inprofile: Eric Moonman, [http://www.liv.ac.uk/insight/2004autumn.pdf \"Insight\" August 2004 Second Issue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051207115434/http://www.liv.ac.uk/insight/2004autumn.pdf |date=7 December 2005 }}</ref> After the war, Moonman undertook his national service in the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Liverpool Regiment]] from 1951 to 1953, during which he took courses in military studies as well as evening classes in subjects such as public speaking. In 1954 he gained a place at the [[University of Liverpool]] to study for a Diploma in Social Science. At Liverpool, he edited the University magazine and became chairman of the Labour Society. Moonman was awarded his diploma in 1955.\n\n==After Parliament==\n===Work on Israel===\nIn June 1967, the Foreign Secretary [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] made a speech to the UN General Assembly on the Israel-Arab Conflict. Moonman was one of a number of Labour MPs to accuse Brown of \"taking sides\" against Israel. At a Jewish ex-servicemen's rally in Southend, Moonman called Brown's speech a \"serious embarrassment\" and said he had \"aggressively departed\" from the Government's neutral policy, giving \"harsh and arrogant advice\" to the Israelis.<ref>Philip Rawstone, 'MPs accuse Mr Brown of 'taking sides'', ''Guardian'', 23 June 1967</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Moonman was at the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Switzerland. He approached Stephen Roth, then director of the [[European Jewish Congress]], and told him that changes had to be made in the way that Israel represented itself abroad. Roth accordingly gave him permission to start up a commission on Israel. In 1974, Moonman convened the first gathering of Jewish professionals to work out propaganda strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greer Fay Cashman, \u2018Selling Israel\u2019, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 26 November 1990</ref>\n\nThe group subsequently met twice every year, once in Europe in the summer and once in Jerusalem in the autumn. Moonman was \u201cthe founder and guiding light\u201d of the organisation which became the West European Public Relations Group for Information on Behalf of Israel. The group was initially funded by the [[World Jewish Congress]] which later withdrew its funding. From 1980 it was funded instead by the [[World Zionist Organization]] and from 1985 also by the Israel Foreign Ministry.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Register of Members' Interests 1975/6 records that Moonman visited a conference in Brussels in February 1976, which was probably the winter meeting of the West European Public Relations Group for Information on Behalf of Israel.

Moonman criticised the visit as \"an attempt to become respectable\". He added \"we demean ourselves as human beings if at a convenient point of time we overlook the track record of these people\".<ref>Peter Niesewand, 'More protests at PLO visit', ''Guardian'', 11 August 1975</ref>\n\nIn June 1977, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published a front-page story and a four-page \u2018Insight\u2019 investigation reporting the alleged torture of Palestinian prisoners in the occupied territories. The Israeli Embassy in London called the assertions a \"vicious slander as it is insulting to the only democracy and free judiciary in the area\".<ref>\u2018Israel denies torture of Arab prisoners\u2019 ''The Times'', 20 June 1977; pg. 1; Issue 60034; col A</ref> Moonman made three complaints about the reports to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]], complaining that unproved accusations were reported as facts, that the paper misled readers with unsubstantiated quotes and headlines, and that Israel was denied the opportunity to comment before publication.

The broadcast reported that Moonman had \"explained his\" opposition to [[Menachem Begin]] in an article in ''The Jewish Chronicle'', wherein Moonman argued that: \"We must support Israel, but we must give consideration to the image of the Israel which we support.

In 1987, however he was forced to resign from BIPAC after a financial scandal which he considered the result of a campaign against him. Below is an extract from ''The Guardian'' explaining the circumstances of Moonman\u2019s departure from BIPAC:\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:beige; border:1pt solid Darkgoldenrod; padding:1%;\">An unusual advert has just appeared in ''The Jewish Chronicle'', asking anyone who knows about a campaign of malice against the former Labour MP Eric Moonman to send the information to a box number. It has been placed, of course, by Moonman himself, who is senior vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and chairman of the Islington Area Health Authority in London. Until recently he was also a board member of the British-Israel Public Affairs Committee (BIPAC), but he resigned at the last meeting following what might be called the Alexander Keddie Affair. Keddie doesn't actually exist, although he was once described as a recluse in Essex who didn't like taking phone calls; the name was simply used over a period of about four years to steer payments to a variety of people, including Moonman, who worked on a BIPAC publication called EEC Monitor. An accountant's report into the affair was prompted by Monty Summary, a prominent Jewish businessman and fundraiser, and it concluded that Moonman had left people confused about the Keddie arrangement. Moonman denies this, and is now intent on unmasking his putative tormentors. 'I do think there is a campaign against me,' he said this week. 'There have been anonymous letters and phone calls as well.'\u201d<ref>Stephen Cook, \u2018People Diary\u2019, ''The Guardian'', 9 October 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 2001, Moonman had joined the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In mid January 2002, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' reported that he headed the Zionist Federation\u2019s Media Response Unit; organising email and letter writing campaigns against journalists perceived to be antisemitic or critical of Israel.<ref>Dennis Sewell, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200201140009 \u2018A kosher conspiracy?\u2019], ''New Statesman'', 14 January 2002</ref> A week after the publishing of that article, Moonman had reportedly become President of the organisation.<ref>Inigo Gilmore and Adam Lusher, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1382093/Harrods-incurs-Jewish-anger-by-removing-Israeli-goods.html \u2018Harrods incurs Jewish anger by removing Israeli goods\u2019], \"Sunday Telegraph\", 20 January 2002</ref>\n\n===Terrorism expert===\nMoonman\u2019s emergence as a terrorism expert seems to have stemmed from his involvement in an organisation called the Centre for Contemporary Studies, a think-tank which published material on football hooliganism and race relations, as well as terrorism. The Centre appears to have been founded by Moonman who seems to have been affected by the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riots]] and anxious about the possibility of societal breakdown.\n\nIn May 1981, the Centre published a report called \"The Nazis are in the Playground\". According to the BBC's ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'' programme, it \"claims extreme right-wing groups are recruiting school children & authorities are unable to control the situation\".

The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American versions of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.

The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American versions of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.

He subsequently switched parties again and entered Parliament as a Liberal in 1972, winning his Rochdale seat on five further occasions.

Throughout much of his career, he maintained a high profile in the media, and became a well-known public figure.\n\nIn later years, his public esteem was considerably marred by the allegation that he had been involved in a cover-up of a health risk at a local [[asbestos]] factory. In 2008, there were calls for Smith to be stripped of his [[knighthood]] after it was revealed that he had asked the asbestos company [[Turner & Newall]] to prepare a speech for him in 1981, in which he declared: \"the public at large are not at risk from asbestos\".<ref name=\"DanczukBaker2014\">{{cite book |author1=Simon Danczuk |author2=Matthew Baker |title=Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRSuAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128 |date=15 April 2014 |publisher=Biteback Publishing |isbn=978-1-84954-730-7 |page=128}}</ref> It was later revealed that Smith owned 1,300 shares in the company.

From 1948 to 1950, he was Liberal agent in [[Stockport (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockport]], but after the poor general election results experienced by the Liberal Party [[1950 United Kingdom general election|in 1950]] and [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] he was advised by the losing Liberal candidate for Stockport, Reg Hewitt, to join the Labour Party.\n\nIn 1952, Smith was elected a Labour Party councillor for the Falinge ward of Rochdale. By 1954, he was chairman of Rochdale Council's Establishment Committee. In 1963 he switched committee roles to be responsible for Estates which included overseeing residential and town centre development.\n\nHe was appointed the Labour Mayor of Rochdale in 1966, with his mother, Eva, acting as mayoress (she retained her job as a cleaner in [[Rochdale Town Hall]] whilst in the post). In her work as a cleaner at the town hall, she was banned from entering the police station \u2013 likewise based in the building \u2013 for she would search through its bins for information to help her son.{{sfn|Danczuk|Baker|2014|p=208}}\n\nSmith's mayoral duties were filmed for the BBC's ''[[Man Alive (BBC TV series)|Man Alive]]'' documentary series, in an episode titled \"Santa Claus for a Year\".{{sfn|Danczuk|Baker|2014|p=55}} In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Education Committee overseeing the introduction of [[comprehensive education]] in the district. In the same year he was appointed Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]]. According to his autobiography,{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=107}} Smith was found guilty of an offence relating to public lotteries and bound over to keep the peace for 12 months.\n\nIn 1966, Smith resigned the Labour [[whip (politics)|whip]] when the party refused to vote for an increase in [[council house]] rents and sat with four other councillors as independents until 1970.

In her work as a cleaner at the town hall, she was banned from entering the police station \u2013 likewise based in the building \u2013 for she would search through its bins for information to help her son.{{sfn|Danczuk|Baker|2014|p=208}}\n\nSmith's mayoral duties were filmed for the BBC's ''[[Man Alive (BBC TV series)|Man Alive]]'' documentary series, in an episode titled \"Santa Claus for a Year\".{{sfn|Danczuk|Baker|2014|p=55}} In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Education Committee overseeing the introduction of [[comprehensive education]] in the district.

According to his autobiography,{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=107}} Smith was found guilty of an offence relating to public lotteries and bound over to keep the peace for 12 months.\n\nIn 1966, Smith resigned the Labour [[whip (politics)|whip]] when the party refused to vote for an increase in [[council house]] rents and sat with four other councillors as independents until 1970. His subsequent return to the Liberal Party, and his election as a Liberal MP, caused surprise after his role in opposing [[Ludovic Kennedy]], the Liberal candidate in the [[1958 Rochdale by-election]]. Controversy was sparked by Rochdale Liberals when the parliamentary candidate, Garth Pratt, was deselected to make way for Smith's return to the party.\n\nDuring the 1960s Smith was active on many Rochdale Council committees regarding youth activities. These included: Rochdale Youth Orchestra, Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, governorship of 29 Rochdale schools and chairmanship of the Youth Committee, Youth Employment Committee and the Education Committee.{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=101}}\n\n===Member of Parliament===\nHaving been Liberal candidate in [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] when he took the party to second place, Smith won the seat at the [[1972 Rochdale by-election|1972 by-election]] with a large swing from Labour to the Liberals, and a majority of 5,171.\n\nHe was appointed as the party Chief Whip in June 1975, and faced pressure from the press in the wake of a scandal involving party leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]].

To my surprise he said the report was correct.\" Steel said that Smith had a supervisory role in institutions in Rochdale where he was involved in [[corporal punishment]].
