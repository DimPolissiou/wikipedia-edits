Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with [[Amnesty International]] and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Produced by [[Prasad V Potluri]] under his banner [[PVP cinema]], the film released on 5 February 2016. Unlike the original, this movie received mixed reviews and failed at the box office, with critics and fans drawing comparisons with the original.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's story revolves around three cousins Arjun ''\"Ajju\"'' ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]), Kannan ''\"Kutty\"'' ([[Bobby Simha]]), and Divya ''\"Ammu\"'' Raghavan ([[Sri Divya]]), who share a close bond since their childhood. Kutty is a [[software engineering|software engineer]] whose heart and soul are still in his village. Ajju, whose parents are divorced, is a bike mechanic who lives his life on his own terms. Ammu has completed her [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com]] and aspires to do her [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Indian Institute of Management|IIM]] but is compelled to marry a workaholic corporate executive, Shivaprasad ''\"Prasad\"'' ([[Rana Daggubati]]) because of her family astrologer's dire predictions. After their wedding, Ammu moves to [[Bangalore]] as Prasad is settled there. Kutty too relocates to Bangalore for his job, while Ajju joins a biker gang as a mechanic in the same city.\n\nAmmu feels lonely as Prasad often goes on long corporate trips and ignores her. Her only solace is the time she gets to spend with her cousins. One day, upon inspecting a room in their apartment that Prasad never lets anyone enter, she is shocked to find it filled with photos, knickknacks and possessions of a woman ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu|Samantha]]). In thought of not having a place in Prasad's heart and life, she leaves Prasad and returns to her village in sorrow.\n\nNaive Kutty, who wants a traditional, modest, [[saree]]-clad girl for a wife, falls in love with an [[air hostess]] Lakshmi ([[Raai Laxmi]]) on a flight from Bangalore to [[Coimbatore]]. They date, and Kutty changes from a reserved and shy person to a trendy person to impress her, but his dreams are shattered when her ex-boyfriend (Arjun G Iyengar) arrives at her apartment, and he realizes that she was only trying to get back with him. He breaks off his relationship with her.\n\nAjju was a bike racer, but due to a misdemeanor, he is forced to serve a one-year ban from racing. Rakesh, who is now a top-bike racer, troubles Ajju. Ajju eventually hits him but is stopped by Coach Zachariah ([[Sijoy Varghese]]). Rakesh tells that Ajju is best at fighting, but he is best in racing. Ajju falls for [[radio jockey|RJ]] Sarah ([[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]]), but when he meets her in person, he finds she is a [[paraplegic]]. He starts to like her attitude and follows her. They become good friends, but Ajju is saddened when he learns that Sarah is to leave for [[Australia]] on a university scholarship.\n\nMeanwhile, as Ammu and Prasad are in the middle of getting a divorce, Ajju learns that a few years back, Prasad was a bike racer. He then went by the name Shiva and was the leader of his biker gang. Shiva had given up on racing after he was involved in an accident that killed his girlfriend Grace (the girl whose photos and possessions that Ammu had discovered in Prasad's room). Upon knowing what happened, Ammu decides to return to Bangalore and works towards her MBA. She gradually wins over a repentant Prasad and soon arranges for him to meet Grace's parents ([[Prakash Raj]] and [[Vinaya Prasad]]). After the meeting, Prasad is able to let go of his past. Ammu forgives him, and they get their marital life on track.\n\nAjju gets a chance to race on the same day that Sarah has to leave for Australia. Rakesh also arrives. With Ammu, Kutty and Prasad cheering for him, he wins the race. After the race, Ajju realizes how important Sarah is to him and his life. He pleads with her not to go to Australia. Sarah forgoes her scholarship to stay with him in Bangalore. In the end, Kutty marries his neighbor in Bangalore, a European [[Bharathanatyam]] dancer Michelle ([[Paris Laxmi]]), who has embraced the culture of India. The film ends with Ammu, Prasad, Ajju, and Sarah breaking into Kutty's room and all of them posing for a photo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arya (actor)|Arya]] as Arjun (''\"Ajju\"''), a bike racer and mechanic with a carefree attitude\n* [[Sri Divya]] as Divya (''\"Ammu\"'') Shivaprasad (n\u00e9e Raghavan) B.Com MBA, she marries Prasad<ref>''Bangalore Naatkal'' (DVD): full name shown at 10.20</ref>\n* [[Bobby Simha]] as Kannan ''\"Kutty\"'', a software engineer who does not like city life\n* [[Rana Daggubati]] as Shivaprasad (''\"Shiva\"''/''\"Prasad\"''), a workaholic corporate executive.

{"title_page": "Consolidated city-county", "text_new": "{{short description|US local jurisdiction comprising a merged city and county}}\n{{Administrative divisions of the United States}}\nIn [[local government in the United States|United States local government]], a '''consolidated city-county''' is a [[city]] and [[County (United States)|county]] that have been [[Merger (politics)|merged]] into one unified jurisdiction. As such it is simultaneously a city, which is a [[municipal corporation]], and a county, which is an administrative division of a state. It has the powers and responsibilities of both types of entities.\n\nA consolidated city-county is different from an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]], although the latter may result from consolidation of a city and a county and may also have the same powers as a consolidated city-county. An independent city is a city not deemed by its state to be located within the boundary of any county and recognized by its state as a legal territorial entity separate from surrounding or adjoining counties. A consolidated city-county differs from an independent city in that the city and county both nominally exist, although they have a consolidated government, whereas in an independent city, the county does not even nominally exist.<ref>[https://www.nlc.org/resource/cities-101-consolidations Cities 101 -- Consolidations], from [[National League of Cities]]</ref>\n\nNot considering [[Hawaii]], which has no independent municipalities, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Upland South|Upper South]] have the highest concentration of large consolidated city-county governments in the United States, including<!-- Please stop adding San Francisco to this list, as it is not in the Midwest or Upper South. --> [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; and [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Currently, the largest consolidated city-county in the United States by population is [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while the largest by land area is [[Sitka, Alaska]].\n\nIn Louisiana, consolidated-city counties are called '''city-parish consolidated governments'''. [[New Orleans]] City-Parish is one example.<ref>[http://www.lafayettela.gov/Council/SiteAssets/Files/Home-Rule-Charter.pdf A Home Rule Charter for the Lafayette City-Parish Consolidated Government]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nAccording to information compiled by former [[Albuquerque]] mayor [[David Rusk]], 105 [[referendum|referenda]] were held in the United States between 1902 and 2010 to consider proposals to consolidate cities and counties. Only 27 of these proposals were approved by voters.<ref>Kate Linebaugh, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304066504576341332888910372 Threats to Town Halls Stir Voter Backlash], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 8, 2011</ref>\n\n[[Wyandotte County, Kansas]], uses the term \"unified government\" to refer to its consolidation with [[Kansas City, Kansas]], and most of the towns within the county boundaries in which some cities and towns remain separate jurisdictions within the county. Individual sections of a metropolitan or regional municipality may retain some autonomous jurisdiction apart from the citywide government.\n\nOften, in place of another level of government, local governments form [[council of governments|councils of governments]] \u2013 essentially governmental organizations which are not empowered with any law-making or law enforcement powers. This is the case in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], where the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] (ARC) studies and makes recommendations on the impact of all major construction and development projects on the region, but generally cannot stop them. The [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] (GRTA) is a true government agency of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]], and does control some state transportation monies to the cities and counties, but otherwise has very little authority beyond this small [[power of the purse]].\n\nThe case of [[New York City]] is unique, in that the city consists of five [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]], each of which is co-extensive with a county. Each borough, being coterminous with a county, has its own district attorney; however, county-level government is essentially non-existent as all executive and legislative power is exercised by the city government throughout the five boroughs. The city, as currently constituted, was created in 1898 when the city of New York (then comprising what would become the boroughs of [[Manhattan]] and [[The Bronx]]) annexed Kings County, Queens County, and Richmond County as the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]], respectively.\n\nSimilar arrangements also exist in other countries. [[England]] has six \"[[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]]\" created in 1974: [[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], and [[West Yorkshire]]. From 1986, these metropolitan counties do not have county councils but rather joint boards for certain functions. Modern [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] are similar, and are known as ''[[county borough]]s'' in [[Wales]]. In Scotland, [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]] are functionally \"independent cities\", though the term is not used. [[London]] is unique however, being a [[Ceremonial counties of england|ceremonial county]] (officially known as [[Greater London]]) containing the ancient [[City of London]] and 32 London boroughs. The single square mile that comprises the City of London is only a tiny part of the ''London'' as a capital city, which takes up 607 square miles.\n\nIn the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], there exist several [[unitary authority|single-tier municipalities]] which serve the same sort of functions as American consolidated city-counties. One example of this is the City of [[Toronto]], which was created in 1998 from the amalgamation of the central government and the six constituent municipalities of [[Metropolitan Toronto|the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] (a type of [[regional municipality]]) which was originally created in 1954.\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]] are both cities and states (the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]] consists of the cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]]). Nearly every larger city in Germany is a consolidated city-county, like Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich or Dresden; [[Austria]], where the capital of [[Vienna]] is both a city and state; [[France]], where the capital city of [[Paris]] has been coterminous with the ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of Paris since [[Seine (department)|1968]]; and [[South Korea]], where [[Seoul]] is a ''[[Special cities of South Korea|special city]]'', while six other cities ([[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Daejeon]], [[Gwangju]], [[Incheon]], and [[Ulsan]]) are ''metropolitan cities''. Additionally, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] government in [[Australia]] performs all municipal functions of the city of [[Canberra]], and thus functions as an integrated city-territory. Similarly, the [[Tokyo City|City of Tokyo]] merged with the prefecture to form [[Tokyo]] metropolis in 1943.\n\n==Balances==\nIn nine consolidated city-county governments in the United States, the formerly independent incorporated places maintain some governmental powers. In these cities, which the [[United States Census Bureau]] calls \"consolidated cities\", statistics are recorded both for the entire consolidated government and for the component municipalities. A part of the consolidated government is called the \"balance\", which the Census Bureau defines as \"the consolidated city minus the semi-independent incorporated places located within the consolidated city\".<ref name=PopEstimates>[https://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/ Population Estimates Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223035326/http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/ |date=2010-02-23 }}, [[United States Census Bureau]], 2006-06-19.

This was not a true consolidation because three municipalities \u2013 [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] and [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]] \u2013 were never annexed into Boston and remained separate jurisdictions within Suffolk County; however, the City of Boston held complete control of the county by law. The special relationship between Boston and Suffolk County ended in 1999 as part of the gradual abolition of county governments through much of the state with all county employees and powers transferred to Commonwealth of Massachusetts control. The only remaining powers and duties for the City of Boston in regards to the county is ceremonial in which the Suffolk County Register of Deeds is issued the oath of office at the start of a term as well as calls for a meeting to hold a special election to fill the office should there be a failure to elect someone to the office or should a vacancy occur.\n*From the 17th century to 1898, [[New York City]] was coterminous with New York County and was often referred to as the \"City and County of New York\". Both were coterminous with [[Manhattan]] until 1874 when the City and County annexed parts of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] that would later become the West Bronx, later annexing the remainder of the future Bronx. Upon [[City of Greater New York|consolidation]] in 1898, New York County was coterminous and consolidated with the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan while the other boroughs were consolidated with their own respective counties. The Bronx was separated from New York County in 1914 to form its own Bronx County, and since then all five boroughs of New York City are coterminous and consolidated with a county of New York state.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Combined Statistical Area]] \n* [[Conurbation]]\n* [[City with powiat rights]]{{nb10}}\n* [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|City of regional significance]]\n* [[City\u2013state]]\n* [[Direct-controlled municipality]]\n* [[Ekistics]]\n* [[Independent city (United States)]]\n* [[Megalopolis (term)]]\n* [[Megacity]]\n* [[Merger (politics)]]\n* [[Metropolitan area]]\n* [[Metropolis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080229163653/http://www.alleghenyconference.org/PEL/PDFs/CityCountyConsolidationsComparativeAnalysis.pdf Comparative of all city/county consolidations and the issues and advantages each model presents (from the Pittsburgh/Allegheny task force on consolidation)]\n\n{{Terms for types of country subdivisions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Consolidated City-County}}\n[[Category:Consolidated city-counties in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:County government in the United States]]\n[[Category:Local government in the United States]]\n[[Category:Counties]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|US local jurisdiction comprising a merged city and county}}\n{{Administrative divisions of the United States}}\nIn [[local government in the United States|United States local government]], a '''consolidated city-county''' is a [[city]] and [[County (United States)|county]] that have been [[Merger (politics)|merged]] into one unified jurisdiction. As such it is simultaneously a city, which is a [[municipal corporation]], and a county, which is an administrative division of a state. It has the powers and responsibilities of both types of entities.\n\nA consolidated city-county is different from an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]], although the latter may result from consolidation of a city and a county and may also have the same powers as a consolidated city-county. An independent city is a city not deemed by its state to be located within the boundary of any county and recognized by its state as a legal territorial entity separate from surrounding or adjoining counties. A consolidated city-county differs from an independent city in that the city and county both nominally exist, although they have a consolidated government, whereas in an independent city, the county does not even nominally exist.<ref>[https://www.nlc.org/resource/cities-101-consolidations Cities 101 -- Consolidations], from [[National League of Cities]]</ref>\n\nNot considering [[Hawaii]], which has no independent municipalities, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Upland South|Upper South]] have the highest concentration of large consolidated city-county governments in the United States, including<!-- Please stop adding San Francisco to this list, as it is not in the Midwest or Upper South. --> [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; and [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Currently, the largest consolidated city-county in the United States by population is [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while the largest by land area is [[Sitka, Alaska]].\n\nIn Louisiana, consolidated-city counties are called '''city-parish consolidated governments'''. [[New Orleans]] City-Parish is one example.<ref>[http://www.lafayettela.gov/Council/SiteAssets/Files/Home-Rule-Charter.pdf A Home Rule Charter for the Lafayette City-Parish Consolidated Government]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nAccording to information compiled by former [[Albuquerque]] mayor [[David Rusk]], 105 [[referendum|referenda]] were held in the United States between 1902 and 2010 to consider proposals to consolidate cities and counties. Only 27 of these proposals were approved by voters.<ref>Kate Linebaugh, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304066504576341332888910372 Threats to Town Halls Stir Voter Backlash], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 8, 2011</ref>\n\n[[Wyandotte County, Kansas]], uses the term \"unified government\" to refer to its consolidation with [[Kansas City, Kansas]], and most of the towns within the county boundaries in which some cities and towns remain separate jurisdictions within the county. Individual sections of a metropolitan or regional municipality may retain some autonomous jurisdiction apart from the citywide government.\n\nOften, in place of another level of government, local governments form [[council of governments|councils of governments]] \u2013 essentially governmental organizations which are not empowered with any law-making or law enforcement powers. This is the case in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], where the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] (ARC) studies and makes recommendations on the impact of all major construction and development projects on the region, but generally cannot stop them. The [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] (GRTA) is a true government agency of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]], and does control some state transportation monies to the cities and counties, but otherwise has very little authority beyond this small [[power of the purse]].\n\nThe case of [[New York City]] is unique, in that the city consists of five [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]], each of which is co-extensive with a county. Each borough, being coterminous with a county, has its own district attorney; however, county-level government is essentially non-existent as all executive and legislative power is exercised by the city government throughout the five boroughs. The city, as currently constituted, was created in 1898 when the city of New York (then comprising what would become the boroughs of [[Manhattan]] and [[The Bronx]]) annexed Kings County, Queens County, and Richmond County as the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]], respectively.\n\nSimilar arrangements also exist in other countries. [[England]] has six \"[[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]]\" created in 1974: [[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], and [[West Yorkshire]]. From 1986, these metropolitan counties do not have county councils but rather joint boards for certain functions. Modern [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] are similar, and are known as ''[[county borough]]s'' in [[Wales]]. In Scotland, [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]] are functionally \"independent cities\", though the term is not used. [[London]] is unique however, being a [[Ceremonial counties of england|ceremonial county]] (officially known as [[Greater London]]) containing the ancient [[City of London]] and 32 London boroughs. The single square mile that comprises the City of London is only a tiny part of the ''London'' as a capital city, which takes up 607 square miles.\n\nIn the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], there exist several [[unitary authority|single-tier municipalities]] which serve the same sort of functions as American consolidated city-counties. One example of this is the City of [[Toronto]], which was created in 1998 from the amalgamation of the central government and the six constituent municipalities of [[Metropolitan Toronto|the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] (a type of [[regional municipality]]) which was originally created in 1954.\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]] are both cities and states (the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]] consists of the cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]]). Nearly every larger city in Germany is a consolidated city-county, like Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich or Dresden; [[Austria]], where the capital of [[Vienna]] is both a city and state; [[France]], where the capital city of [[Paris]] has been coterminous with the ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of Paris since [[Seine (department)|1968]]; and [[South Korea]], where [[Seoul]] is a ''[[Special cities of South Korea|special city]]'', while six other cities ([[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Daejeon]], [[Gwangju]], [[Incheon]], and [[Ulsan]]) are ''metropolitan cities''. Additionally, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] government in [[Australia]] performs all municipal functions of the city of [[Canberra]], and thus functions as an integrated city-territory. Similarly, the [[Tokyo City|City of Tokyo]] merged with the prefecture to form [[Tokyo]] metropolis in 1943.\n\n==Balances==\nIn nine consolidated city-county governments in the United States, the formerly independent incorporated places maintain some governmental powers. In these cities, which the [[United States Census Bureau]] calls \"consolidated cities\", statistics are recorded both for the entire consolidated government and for the component municipalities. A part of the consolidated government is called the \"balance\", which the Census Bureau defines as \"the consolidated city minus the semi-independent incorporated places located within the consolidated city\".<ref name=PopEstimates>[https://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/ Population Estimates Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223035326/http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/ |date=2010-02-23 }}, [[United States Census Bureau]], 2006-06-19.

The only remaining powers and duties for the City of Boston in regards to the county is ceremonial in which the Suffolk County Register of Deeds is issued the oath of office at the start of a term as well as calls for a meeting to hold a special election to fill the office should there be a failure to elect someone to the office or should a vacancy occur.\n*From the 17th century to 1898, [[New York City]] was coterminous with New York County and was often referred to as the \"City and County of New York\".

Upon [[City of Greater New York|consolidation]] in 1898, New York County was coterminous and consolidated with the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan while the other boroughs were consolidated with their own respective counties. The Bronx was separated from New York County in 1914 to form its own Bronx County, and since then all five boroughs of New York City are coterminous and consolidated with a county of New York state.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Combined Statistical Area]] \n* [[Conurbation]]\n* [[City with powiat rights]]{{nb10}}\n* [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|City of regional significance]]\n* [[City\u2013state]]\n* [[Direct-controlled municipality]]\n* [[Ekistics]]\n* [[Independent city (United States)]]\n* [[Megalopolis (term)]]\n* [[Megacity]]\n* [[Merger (politics)]]\n* [[Metropolitan area]]\n* [[Metropolis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080229163653/http://www.alleghenyconference.org/PEL/PDFs/CityCountyConsolidationsComparativeAnalysis.pdf Comparative of all city/county consolidations and the issues and advantages each model presents (from the Pittsburgh/Allegheny task force on consolidation)]\n\n{{Terms for types of country subdivisions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Consolidated City-County}}\n[[Category:Consolidated city-counties in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:County government in the United States]]\n[[Category:Local government in the United States]]\n[[Category:Counties]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\" and reduced ALLCAPS \u2013 please seeWikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Capital_letters#All_caps_and_small_capsabout reducing ALLCAPS, even in headlines and titles.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_city-county"}

However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.\nA ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].\nDomestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n==== Social behaviour ====\n[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]\n[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]\nChickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"[[pecking order]]\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock \" Musings from a Stonehead |website=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813113406/http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhen a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.\n\nA rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115124738/https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=211\u2013222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0c15\u0c4b\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32IMG20191207080730-01.jpg|thumb |right]]\n\n==== Broodiness ====\nUnder natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go [[Broodiness|broody]]\".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12&nbsp;eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.\n[[File:1911 EB Chicken skull.png|thumb|left|200px|Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species \u2014 even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], or [[Goose|geese]].\n\n{{clear}}\n==== Hatching and early life ====\nFertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.<ref name=\"grandin69\"/> Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.\n\nHens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]]. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=A. |last2=Cheng |first2=K.M. |year=1985 |title=Early egg production in genetically blind (rc/rc) chickens in comparison with sighted (Rc+/rc) controls |journal=Poultry Science |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=789\u2013794 |doi=10.3382/ps.0640789 |pmid=4001066|doi-access=free }}</ref> Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night.

In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gongora |first1=Jaime |last2=Rawlence |first2=Nicolas J. |last3=Mobegi |first3=Victor A. |last4=Jianlin |first4=Han |last5=Alcalde |first5=Jose A. |last6=Matus |first6=Jose T. |last7=Hanotte |first7=Olivier |last8=Moran |first8=Chris |last9=Austin |first9=J. | last10 = Ulm | first10 = Sean |last11=Anderson |first11=Atholl J. |last12=Larson |first12=Greger |last13=Cooper |first13=Alan |year=2008 |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA |url= |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10308\u201310313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105 |pmid=18663216 |pmc=2492461 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10510308G}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe debate for and against a Polynesian origin for South American chickens continued with this 2014 paper and subsequent responses in ''PNAS''.<ref name=\"ThomsonLebrasseur2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Vicki A.|last2=Lebrasseur|first2=Oph\u00e9lie|last3=Austin|first3=Jeremy J.|last4=Hunt|first4=Terry L.|last5=Burney|first5=David A.|last6=Denham|first6=Tim|last7=Rawlence|first7=Nicolas J.|last8=Wood|first8=Jamie R.|last9=Gongora|first9=Jaime|last10=Girdland Flink|first10=Linus|last11=Linderholm|first11=Anna|last12=Dobney|first12=Keith|last13=Larson|first13=Greger|last14=Cooper|first14=Alan|title=Using ancient DNA to study the origins and dispersal of ancestral Polynesian chickens across the Pacific|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=13|year=2014|pages=4826\u20134831|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320412111|pmid=24639505|pmc=3977275|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.4826T}}</ref>\n\n== Use by humans ==\n\n=== Farming ===\n{{Main|Poultry farming|Chicken as food}}\n[[File:BatteryChicken5DaysOutOfCage.jpg|thumb|upright|A former [[Battery cage|battery]] hen, five days after release.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.\n\nMany commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.\n\n== Diseases and ailments ==\nChickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.

A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.\n\nIn [[ancient Greece]], chickens were not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were \"[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.\n\nThe Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: \"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'\"<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34</ref> It happened,<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61</ref> and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.\n\nEarlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34.

A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one's mate\" from the rooster.<ref>Eruvin 100b.</ref> This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",<ref>A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron \u2013 1985</ref><ref>Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b</ref> which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Sa\u02bbadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]]) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",<ref>PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages</ref> identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.\n\nThe chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.\n\nA [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.\n\n== In history ==\n[[File:Red junglefowl hm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[red junglefowl]]]]\nAn early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] {{crossref|(see [[Austronesian languages]])}}.

It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).\n\nThe Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by [[eagles]] or [[goshawks]]. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).\n\nColumella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops#v=onepage&q=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&f=false|title=The New England Farmer|date=March 13, 2019|page=69|publisher=Thomas W.

Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand.

However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.\nA ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].\nDomestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n==== Social behaviour ====\n[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]\n[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]\nChickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"[[pecking order]]\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock \" Musings from a Stonehead |website=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813113406/http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhen a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.\n\nA rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115124738/https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=211\u2013222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0c15\u0c4b\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32IMG20191207080730-01.jpg|thumb |right]]\n\n==== Broodiness ====\nUnder natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go [[Broodiness|broody]]\".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12&nbsp;eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest.

Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.\n\nHens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]]. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=A. |last2=Cheng |first2=K.M. |year=1985 |title=Early egg production in genetically blind (rc/rc) chickens in comparison with sighted (Rc+/rc) controls |journal=Poultry Science |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=789\u2013794 |doi=10.3382/ps.0640789 |pmid=4001066|doi-access=free }}</ref> Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.\n\nMany commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.\n\n== Diseases and ailments ==\nChickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.  Despite the name, they are not affected by [[chickenpox]], which is generally restricted to humans.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2001.tb00416.x |last1=White |first1=T.

A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.\n\nIn [[ancient Greece]], chickens were not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were \"[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.\n\nThe Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: \"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'\"<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34</ref> It happened,<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61</ref> and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.\n\nEarlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34.

Tilton \"[http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ Chickens and the Cultural Context of the Gospels] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808033636/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ |date=August 8, 2014 }}\" [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ www.jerusalemperspective.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802235120/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ |date=August 2, 2014 }}.</ref>\n\nIn the sixth century, [[Pope Gregory I]] declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity<ref>The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson \u2013 page 202</ref> and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by [[Pope Nicholas I]]<ref name=\"smithsonianmag.com\" /> ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.<ref>''The Philadelphia Museum bulletin'', Volumes 1-5, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, p 14, 1906</ref>\n\nIn many Central European [[Folklore|folk tales]], the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.\n\nIn traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move him or her around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one's mate\" from the rooster.<ref>Eruvin 100b.</ref> This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",<ref>A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron \u2013 1985</ref><ref>Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b</ref> which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Sa\u02bbadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]]) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",<ref>PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages</ref> identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.\n\nThe chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony.

It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).\n\nThe Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by [[eagles]] or [[goshawks]]. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).\n\nColumella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops#v=onepage&q=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&f=false|title=The New England Farmer|date=March 13, 2019|page=69|publisher=Thomas W.

Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.\n\nColumella<ref>{{Cite book |title=On agriculture, volume II: books 5\u20139 |last=ES Forster, EH Heffner |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1954 |isbn=978-0674994485 |location=The Loeb Classical Library |pages=355}}</ref> advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren't productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens' eggs.\n\nAccording to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|title=The Wisdom of Birds: An Illustrated History of Ornithology|first=Tim|last=Birkhead|page=278|date=March 13, 2019|publisher=Bloomsbury|accessdate=March 13, 2019|via=Google Books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913140939/https://books.google.com/books?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&source=bl&ots=ulBRruboVR&sig=UgJy-zQT0EAjOEaguDrqH9jYzCQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1n1LUN6FK-G8yAGMi4DYAQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live|isbn=9780747598220}}</ref> with a hot iron.
