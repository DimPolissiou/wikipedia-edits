However, while much of the traffic from Highway&nbsp;407, Highway&nbsp;401 (eastbound), and the QEW/Gardiner Expressway makes use of the freeway for airport access, it also serves as a major traffic route for the western portion of [[Toronto]] ([[Etobicoke]]), the northeastern portion of [[Mississauga]] ([[Malton, Mississauga|Malton]]), the southeastern portion of [[Brampton]] ([[Claireville, Brampton|Claireville]]), and the western portion of [[Vaughan]] ([[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]]). The section between Highway 401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor; the {{convert|1.61|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch between [[Burnhamthorpe Road|Burnhamthorpe]] and [[Rathburn Road|Rathburn]] saw an average of over 400,000 vehicles and over 5,000 buses per day in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raqsa.mto.gov.on.ca/techpubs/TrafficVolumes.nsf/tvweb|title=Ontario Provincial Highways Traffic Volumes On Demand|website=www.raqsa.mto.gov.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-06}}</ref> [[GO Transit]], [[Mississauga Transit|MiWay]], and the [[Toronto Transit Commission|Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)]] all operate express buses along this section of the highway.\n\nFirst designated in 1972, Highway&nbsp;427 assumed the recently-completed 12-lane collector-express freeway of [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], as well as a short freeway north of Highway&nbsp;401 known as the '''Airport Expressway'''. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway&nbsp;7 over the following twenty years.

Notable about Highway&nbsp;427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway&nbsp;401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with [[Ontario Highway 409|Highway&nbsp;409]] and [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407]] were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively.\n\nHighway&nbsp;427 is the main feeder to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] from the north and south.  However, while much of the traffic from Highway&nbsp;407, Highway&nbsp;401 (eastbound), and the QEW/Gardiner Expressway makes use of the freeway for airport access, it also serves as a major traffic route for the western portion of [[Toronto]] ([[Etobicoke]]), the northeastern portion of [[Mississauga]] ([[Malton, Mississauga|Malton]]), the southeastern portion of [[Brampton]] ([[Claireville, Brampton|Claireville]]), and the western portion of [[Vaughan]] ([[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]]). The section between Highway 401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor; the {{convert|1.61|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch between [[Burnhamthorpe Road|Burnhamthorpe]] and [[Rathburn Road|Rathburn]] saw an average of over 400,000 vehicles and over 5,000 buses per day in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raqsa.mto.gov.on.ca/techpubs/TrafficVolumes.nsf/tvweb|title=Ontario Provincial Highways Traffic Volumes On Demand|website=www.raqsa.mto.gov.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-06}}</ref> [[GO Transit]], [[Mississauga Transit|MiWay]], and the [[Toronto Transit Commission|Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)]] all operate express buses along this section of the highway.\n\nFirst designated in 1972, Highway&nbsp;427 assumed the recently-completed 12-lane collector-express freeway of [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], as well as a short freeway north of Highway&nbsp;401 known as the '''Airport Expressway'''. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway&nbsp;7 over the following twenty years. A short [[arterial road|arterial]] extension was later built past Highway&nbsp;7 to Zenway Boulevard, though this section is designated as York Regional Road&nbsp;99. Plans have been announced to extend Highway&nbsp;427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive; construction began in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.<ref>{{cite press release\n | first = Patrick |last = Searle |first2= Bob |last2= Nichols\n | title      = Ontario Moving Forward on Highway 427 Extension\n | publisher  = Ministry of Transportation of Ontario\n | url        = https://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2016/03/ontario-moving-forward-on-highway-427-expansion.html\n | date       = March 3, 2016\n |access-date= August 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Route description ==\n[[File:427 take 2.JPG|thumb|left|Highway 427 begins at a complicated interchange with the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) and [[Gardiner Expressway]].]]\nHighway 427 is the second-busiest freeway in Canada with an average of 300,000 vehicles that use it between the QEW and Highway&nbsp;401 per day.

The highway weaves through a complicated [[interchange (road)|interchange]], providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to [[The Queensway]], QEW/Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a [[Local-express lanes|collector-express system]]. Flyover ramps to and from the QEW/Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway&nbsp;401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges.<ref name=\"GHmap\">{{cite map\n\n | title     = Golden Horseshoe\n | author    = MapArt\n | publisher = Peter Heiler Ltd.\n | year      = 2011\n | pages     = 101, 107, 113, 118, 353\n | section   = A2\u2013T5<!-- pp. 101, 107, 113, 118 -->, X\u2013Z3<!-- p. 353 -->\n | isbn      = 978-1-55198-877-1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:427 south of Eglinton.png|thumb|right|Highway 427 south of Eglinton Avenue features a collector-express system.]]\nAfter crossing [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) tracks, the freeway interchanges with [[Dundas Street]].

The remainder was designed to follow the existing [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of Highway&nbsp;27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).<ref name=\"speed60\">{{cite news\n\n | title      = Speed Limit In Ontario Now At 60\n | work       = The Ottawa Citizen\n | date       = May 29, 1959\n | page       = 23\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zvoxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cOQFAAAAIBAJ&dq=toronto-bypass&pg=3054%2C3466986\n | accessdate = March 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Toronto Bypass began near Yonge Street in 1949 (along present-day Highway&nbsp;401) and on the four-laning of Highway&nbsp;27 in 1953.{{sfn|Sewell|2009|p=63}}<ref>{{cite report\n\n | title     = Annual Report\n | first     = W.A\n | last      = Clarke\n | publisher = Department of Highways\n | date      = March 31, 1954\n | section   = Report of the Chief Engineer\n | page      = 12}}</ref>\nThe Highway&nbsp;27 work involved the construction of two interchanges: a three-way [[stack interchange|stack]] at Highway&nbsp;401 and a large [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] at the QEW, the latter of which would become one of the worst [[Traffic bottleneck|bottlenecks]] in the province a decade after its completion, according to [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario|Minister of Transportation]] [[Charles MacNaughton]].<ref name=\"size\">{{cite news\n\n | title     = Six-Mile Stretch of Highway 27 Will Be Expanded to Six Lanes\n | work      = The Globe and Mail\n | location  = Toronto\n | date      = May 4, 1965\n | page      = 5}}</ref>\nBy September 1956, it was possible to bypass Toronto entirely on the four lane divided highway composed of Highway&nbsp;401 and Highway&nbsp;27.<ref>{{cite book\n\n | title     = '401' The Macdonald\u2013Cartier Freeway\n | publisher = Ministry of Transportation and Communications\n | year      = 1972\n | page      = 8}}</ref>{{sfn|Shragge|Bagnato|1984|p=94}}\nHighway&nbsp;401 was extended to the west soon after,<ref name=\"west401\">{{cite book |author= Ministry of Transportation and Communications  |pages= 8\u20139 |title= Hwy. 10 to Hwy 27.

(This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985.)  The sequesters were designed to take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]]. These cuts were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1, when this law went into effect.  At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours.  Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] civilian and full-time Reserve Component member.\n\nLater, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown. During the shutdown, most \"non-essential\" government employees were furloughed.  This resulted in approximately 800,000 government workers being put on a leave beginning October 1.

(This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985.)  The sequesters were designed to take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]]. These cuts were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1, when this law went into effect.  At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours.  Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] civilian and full-time Reserve Component member.\n\nLater, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown. During the shutdown, most \"non-essential\" government employees were furloughed.  This resulted in approximately 800,000 government workers being put on a leave beginning October 1. Congress later unanimously voted to restore pay to the furloughed workers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Korte, Gomez|first=Gregory, Alan|title=Congress likely to restore pay for furloughed workers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/10/05/congress-shutdown-furloughed-pay/2926887/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/politics/federal-agencies-lay-out-contingency-plans-for-possible-shutdown.html |title=Federal Agencies Lay Out Contingency Plans for Possible Shutdown |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 28, 2013 |access-date = 5 March 2020|first1=Michael S. |last1=Schmidt |first2=Thom |last2=Shanker |first3=Andrew |last3=Siddons}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2018 and 2019====\n{{Main|2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown}}\n\nDue to the government shutdown starting on December 22, 2018, approximately 350,000 federal employees were furloughed for 35 days until January 25, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/09/shutdowns-economic-damage-1-billion-a-week-1071609|title=Shutdown\u2019s economic damage: $1 billion a week|last=Guida|first=Victoria|date=January 9, 2019|website=Politico|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2020 in the United States ====\nIn September 2019 the [[United States Department of Labor]] issued [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/70-flsa-furloughs Fact Sheet #70 governing furloughs].
