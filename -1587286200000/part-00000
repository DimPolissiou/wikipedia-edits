The main antagonist, known only as the titular \"Granny\", is alerted via sound. The overall objective of the game is to escape the home by using clues and solving puzzles.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game takes place in an old house where the main character (the player) is trapped. The player must explore the house to find items that can help him escape the house in 5 days (6 if an optional puzzle is solved). Items include a hammer to pry out planks of wood, a shotgun to shoot Granny, and a crossbow to knock down tall objects or to knock out Granny. The house currently has 6 floors, including a garage and 2 attic areas. The player can escape by clearing away the obstacles on the front door, which requires the player to find a pair of cutting pliers, a hammer, a padlock code, a padlock key and a master key (these items are required to unlock the main door, but getting these items may require more), or by repairing the car in the garage, which requires gasoline, a car key, a car battery, a spark plug, an engine part and a wrench.\n\nGranny \u2013 the antagonist \u2013 searches the house for the player. Granny has an excellent sense of hearing and will run toward any loud sound that she hears, whether from a discarded object or a creaking floorboard. Granny runs toward the player until she loses sight of him, and place bear traps around the house to catch the player.  Granny's running speed differs depending on the game's difficulty (easy, medium, hard, or extreme). On 'extreme' difficulty, Granny runs faster than the player; on 'practice' difficulty, Granny is not present, and the player is allowed to freely roam and figure out how to escape the house. There's also a woolly spider in the one of the attic floors, which attacks the player if they get too close. The player will have to use a piece of meat to distract the woolly spider or shoot it with the crossbow or shotgun. The Nightmare Mode adds more challenges to the Extreme difficulty, by adding a darker, bloodier texture over most surfaces, making it harder to see the edges of most objects. Nightmare mode also makes Granny's bear traps much harder to avoid.\n\nThe player can hide under beds or in wardrobes, as long as Granny doesn't see the player hiding. If the player is caught, Granny swings her baseball bat at the player's head, which ends the current day. The player can also get knocked out by falling from the unstable floor or woolly spider in the attic. If the player is caught on the last day, one of 4 \"game over\" cut-scenes play, including being attacked by Granny in the basement, getting run over by the car in the garage, having their head chopped off by the guillotine in the backyard, and falling onto a bear trap through the weak attic floor. The player can defend themselves from Granny by shooting her with the crossbow, making her walk over an ice trap, trapping her in the sauna (located in the garage) for a period of time, or shooting her with the shotgun to remove Granny as a threat for a period of time (2 minutes in Easy, 1 minute in Medium, 30 seconds in Hard, and 15 seconds in Extreme. An extra 30 seconds can be added if Granny is shot with the shotgun in Nightmare Mode).\n\nThe player also receives injuries during the period of time they are in the house. On the first day, the player has no injuries. On the second day, the player walks with a limp. On the third day, the limp becomes more severe. On the fourth day, the player's vision is splattered with drops of blood and the bed they wake up in has blood on it. From here on, the player sustains no more injuries. During the \"game over\" cut-scenes, the vision of the player will remain the same as it had on the previous day.\n\nWhen the player manages to escape through the front door, Granny will stand behind him (unless on Practice difficulty, in which case she waits outside the open door) as the player runs. If the player does not put the teddy bear into the baby's crib in the attic before escaping, Granny will jump-scare and attack the player when the screen turns black. If the player puts the teddy bear into the crib, Granny will sit on the front step holding the teddy bear in her left hand before turning around to watch the player run away, and is joined with her granddaughter Slenderina as the camera pans away.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game's plot is not mentioned in the mobile version. In the Steam release, the game starts off with a cut-scene of the player walking through the woods. The player finds Granny's house and is subsequently attacked by Granny. The player awakes in a bed, which starts the game properly. According to a note on a piece of wood that is found inside the basement walls, the player is not the first person that Granny has trapped. It is unclear if the previous visitor escaped the house, but the note indicates that they were quite badly injured and aware that they had little chance of escaping.\n\n== Series continuation ==\n\n=== [[Granny: Chapter Two]] ===\nA second game of the Granny series, named ''Granny: Chapter Two'', was released on September 6, 2019.\n\nSimilar to the first installment, you are trapped in a house. In the first game, there was only Granny, her pet crow, rats, and pet spider. In ''Granny: Chapter Two'', there are more enemies to face whilst escaping the house. The list of enemies is Granny, Grandpa, Slendrina's baby, and the sewer monster. The player can choose a practice mode where Granny and Grandpa both are not home; a game where only Granny or only Grandpa is included or have them both in the house.\n\nThere are some new items in this game, such as the double-barrel shotgun, stun-gun, crowbar, grenades, and boat key. There are two extra locks. The player can escape through the front door which is located on the first floor, by the boat in the sewer which is located in the basement, where the player woke up, or by the helicopter which the player gains access by taking the security key on Grandpa's neck. When the player loses Granny and Grandpa either feed the player to the sewer monster or using the ancient iron maiden on the player. When the player kills Slendrina's baby, the player will hear heartbeats in the background, Slendrina's child moaning, a giant Slendrina's head on top of the baby which will watch your every movement. Granny's and Grandpa's eyes will turn red, and just like the first installment, they know where you are. Grandpa doesn't hear anything except when the player uses the iron maiden, drops his favorite vase, shotgun shots, when the player knocks out Granny, gasoline explosions, the security alarm, and when Slendrina's baby got killed.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2017 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Horror video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Granny\n| developer = [[DVloper]]\n| publisher = [[DVloper]]\n| series = ''[[Slenderina (series)|Slenderina]]''\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = [[Android (operating system)|Android]]<br \\> [[iOS]]<br \\> [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released = {{Unbulleted list|'''Android'''|November 24, 2017|'''iOS'''|December 11, 2017|'''Microsoft Windows'''|November 20, 2018}}\n| genre = [[Survival horror]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''Granny''' is an [[Indie]] [[ survival horror]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[DVloper]]. It is a spin-off to the Slenderina series. The game features an unnamed protagonist trapped in a house, needing to solve puzzles while avoiding a \"Granny\" to get out of the house in a time period of only five days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/962400/Granny/|title=Granny on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game gained heavy traction following its release through various media platforms, such as [[YouTube]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] and others. The latest update the game received was on April 18, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/granny-update-17-how-find-new-room-freeze-trap-pet-crow-weapon-car-tips-1361834|title=Here's how to find all the new stuff in Granny update 1.7|last=EDT|first=Cammy Harbison On 3/13/19 at 3:12 PM|date=2019-03-13|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game is heavily based around sound. The main antagonist, known only as the titular \"Granny\", is alerted via sound. The overall objective of the game is to escape the home by using clues and solving puzzles.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game takes place in an old house where the main character (the player) is trapped. The player must explore the house to find items that can help him escape the house in 5 days (6 if an optional puzzle is solved). Items include a hammer to pry out planks of wood, a shotgun to shoot Granny, and a crossbow to knock down tall objects or to knock out Granny. The house currently has 6 floors, including a garage and 2 attic areas. The player can escape by clearing away the obstacles on the front door, which requires the player to find a pair of cutting pliers, a hammer, a padlock code, a padlock key and a master key (these items are required to unlock the main door, but getting these items may require more), or by repairing the car in the garage, which requires gasoline, a car key, a car battery, a spark plug, an engine part and a wrench.\n\nGranny \u2013 the antagonist \u2013 searches the house for the player. Granny has an excellent sense of hearing and will run toward any loud sound that she hears, whether from a discarded object or a creaking floorboard. Granny runs toward the player until she loses sight of him, and place bear traps around the house to catch the player.  Granny's running speed differs depending on the game's difficulty (easy, medium, hard, or extreme). On 'extreme' difficulty, Granny runs faster than the player; on 'practice' difficulty, Granny is not present, and the player is allowed to freely roam and figure out how to escape the house. There's also a woolly spider in the one of the attic floors, which attacks the player if they get too close. The player will have to use a piece of meat to distract the woolly spider or shoot it with the crossbow or shotgun. The Nightmare Mode adds more challenges to the Extreme difficulty, by adding a darker, bloodier texture over most surfaces, making it harder to see the edges of most objects. Nightmare mode also makes Granny's bear traps much harder to avoid.\n\nThe player can hide under beds or in wardrobes, as long as Granny doesn't see the player hiding. If the player is caught, Granny swings her baseball bat at the player's head, which ends the current day. The player can also get knocked out by falling from the unstable floor or woolly spider in the attic. If the player is caught on the last day, one of 4 \"game over\" cut-scenes play, including being attacked by Granny in the basement, getting run over by the car in the garage, having their head chopped off by the guillotine in the backyard, and falling onto a bear trap through the weak attic floor. The player can defend themselves from Granny by shooting her with the crossbow, making her walk over an ice trap, trapping her in the sauna (located in the garage) for a period of time, or shooting her with the shotgun to remove Granny as a threat for a period of time (2 minutes in Easy, 1 minute in Medium, 30 seconds in Hard, and 15 seconds in Extreme. An extra 30 seconds can be added if Granny is shot with the shotgun in Nightmare Mode).\n\nThe player also receives injuries during the period of time they are in the house. On the first day, the player has no injuries. On the second day, the player walks with a limp. On the third day, the limp becomes more severe. On the fourth day, the player's vision is splattered with drops of blood and the bed they wake up in has blood on it. From here on, the player sustains no more injuries. During the \"game over\" cut-scenes, the vision of the player will remain the same as it had on the previous day.\n\nWhen the player manages to escape through the front door, Granny will stand behind him (unless on Practice difficulty, in which case she waits outside the open door) as the player runs. If the player does not put the teddy bear into the baby's crib in the attic before escaping, Granny will jump-scare and attack the player when the screen turns black. If the player puts the teddy bear into the crib, Granny will sit on the front step holding the teddy bear in her left hand before turning around to watch the player run away, and is joined with her granddaughter Slenderina as the camera pans away.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game's plot is not mentioned in the mobile version.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=103}}\n\n====Chapman\u2013Enskog theory====\n\n{{Main||Chapman\u2013Enskog theory}}\n\nA technique developed by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]] in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of <math>\\mu</math>.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} It is based on the [[Boltzmann equation]], which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Cercignani|1975|p=}} As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of <math>\\mu</math> for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\n\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of <math>\\mu</math>, which experiments show increases more rapidly than the <math>T^{1/2}</math> trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model,{{efn|The discussion which follows draws from {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp=232\u2013237}} }} which describes rigid elastic spheres with ''weak'' mutual attraction.

It turns out that expressions for <math>\\mu</math> obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures.

Rather, they interpret the prediction for <math>\\mu</math> as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature.

The presence of internal circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=33}}\n\n===Amorphous materials===\n\n[[File:Glassviscosityexamples.png|upright=1.6|thumb|Common [[glass]] viscosity curves{{sfn|Fluegel|2007}}]]\n\nIn the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in [[Amorphous solid|amorphous materials]] (e.g. in [[glass]]es and melts){{sfn|Doremus|2002|pp=7619\u20137629}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Lee|2004|pp=3803\u20133810}} has the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius form]]:\n\n:<math>\\mu = A e^{Q/(RT)},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|Q}} is a relevant [[activation energy]], given in terms of molecular parameters; {{mvar|T}} is temperature; {{mvar|R}} is the molar [[gas constant]]; and {{mvar|A}} is approximately a constant.

Upon specifying the temperature dependence of the shear modulus via thermal expansion and via the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, a two-exponential equation is retrieved as in the Krausser-Samwer-Zaccone (KSZ) equation.

For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

The quantity <math>\\lambda</math>, the [[mean free path]], measures the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Even without ''a priori'' knowledge of <math>\\alpha</math>, this expression has interesting implications. In particular, since <math>\\lambda</math> is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, <math>\\mu</math> itself should increase with temperature and be ''independent'' of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations. Note that this behavior runs counter to common intuition regarding liquids, for which viscosity typically ''decreases'' with temperature.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}}{{sfn|Bellac|Mortessagne|Batrouni|2004|p=}}\n\nFor rigid elastic spheres of diameter <math>\\sigma</math>, <math>\\lambda</math> can be computed, giving\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi^{3/2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_\\text{B} m T}}{\\sigma^2}.\n</math>\n\nIn this case <math>\\lambda</math> is independent of temperature, so <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>. For more complicated molecular models, however, <math>\\lambda</math> depends on temperature in a non-trivial way, and simple kinetic arguments as used here are inadequate. More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=103}}\n\n====Chapman\u2013Enskog theory====\n\n{{Main||Chapman\u2013Enskog theory}}\n\nA technique developed by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]] in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of <math>\\mu</math>.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} It is based on the [[Boltzmann equation]], which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Cercignani|1975|p=}} As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of <math>\\mu</math> for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\n\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of <math>\\mu</math>, which experiments show increases more rapidly than the <math>T^{1/2}</math> trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model,{{efn|The discussion which follows draws from {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp=232\u2013237}} }} which describes rigid elastic spheres with ''weak'' mutual attraction. In such a case, the attractive force can be treated [[Perturbation theory|perturbatively]], which leads to a particularly simple expression for <math>\\mu</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\frac{5}{16 \\sigma^2} \\left(\\frac{k_\\text{B} m T}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{S}{T} \\right)^{-1},\n</math>\nwhere <math>S</math> is independent of temperature, being determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction. To connect with experiment, it is convenient to rewrite as\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{T_0 + S}{T + S},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity at temperature <math>T_0</math>.{{sfn|Sutherland|1893|pp=507\u2013531}} If <math>\\mu</math> is known from experiments at <math>T = T_0</math> and at least one other temperature, then <math>S</math> can be calculated. It turns out that expressions for <math>\\mu</math> obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures.

Rather, they interpret the prediction for <math>\\mu</math> as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as is the case for vapors with highly [[polar molecules]] like [[Properties of water|H<sub>2</sub>O]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 235\u2013237}}\n\n==== Bulk viscosity ====\n\nIn the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. [[Rotational energy|rotational]] and [[vibration]]al. As such, the bulk viscosity is <math>0</math> for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like [[carbon dioxide]], whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 197, 214\u2013216}}{{sfn|Cramer|2012|p=066102-2}}\n\n===Pure liquids===\n{{See also||Temperature dependence of liquid viscosity}}\n\n[[File:Viscosity video science museum.ogv|thumb|Video showing three liquids with different viscosities]]\n[[File:09. \u0412\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.ogg|thumb|Experiment showing the behavior of a viscous fluid with blue dye for visibility]]\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.\n\nAt the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces\nacting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because\nincreasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions.{{sfn|Reid|Sherwood|1958|p=202}}\n\nBuilding on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid \nare visualized as forming \"cages\" which surround and enclose single molecules.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=29\u201331}} These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and\nstronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages.\nDue to random thermal motion, a molecule \"hops\" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions.

For spheres, this results in the Einstein equation:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{2} \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity of the suspending liquid. The linear dependence on <math>\\phi</math> is a direct consequence of neglecting interparticle interactions; in general, one will have\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the coefficient <math>B</math> may depend on the particle shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks).{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=32}} Experimental determination of the precise value of <math>B</math> is difficult, however: even the prediction <math>B = 5/2</math> for spheres has not been conclusively validated, with various experiments finding values in the range <math>1.5 \\lesssim B \\lesssim 5</math>. This deficiency has been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions.{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}}\n\nIn denser suspensions, <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> acquires a nonlinear dependence on <math>\\phi</math>, which indicates the importance of interparticle interactions. Various analytical and semi-empirical schemes exist for capturing this regime. At the most basic level, a term quadratic in <math>\\phi</math> is added to <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi + B_1 \\phi^2 \\right),\n</math>\n\nand the coefficient <math>B_1</math> is fit from experimental data or approximated from the microscopic theory. In general, however, one should be cautious in applying such simple formulas since non-Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions (<math>\\phi \\gtrsim 0.25</math> for spheres),{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}} or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=31\u201333}}\n\nThere is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described above, and an [[emulsion]]. The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=33}}\n\n===Amorphous materials===\n\n[[File:Glassviscosityexamples.png|upright=1.6|thumb|Common [[glass]] viscosity curves{{sfn|Fluegel|2007}}]]\n\nIn the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in [[Amorphous solid|amorphous materials]] (e.g. in [[glass]]es and melts){{sfn|Doremus|2002|pp=7619\u20137629}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Lee|2004|pp=3803\u20133810}} has the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius form]]:\n\n:<math>\\mu = A e^{Q/(RT)},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|Q}} is a relevant [[activation energy]], given in terms of molecular parameters; {{mvar|T}} is temperature; {{mvar|R}} is the molar [[gas constant]]; and {{mvar|A}} is approximately a constant.

Besides being a convenient fit to data, the expression can also be derived from various theoretical models of amorphous materials at the atomic level.{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}\n\nA similar two-exponential equation can be derived within the Dyre shoving model of supercooled liquids, where the Arrhenius energy barrier is identified with the high-frequency [[shear modulus]] times a characteristic shoving volume.{{sfn|Dyre|Olsen|Christensen|1996|p=2171}}. Upon specifying the temperature dependence of the shear modulus via thermal expansion and via the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, a two-exponential equation is retrieved as in the Krausser-Samwer-Zaccone equation, where the parameters are specified in terms of the repulsive part of the molecular interaction and in terms of the [[thermal expansion]] coefficient.{{sfn|Krausser|Samwer|Zaccone|2015|p=13762}}\n\n===Eddy viscosity===\nIn the study of [[turbulence]] in [[fluid]]s, a common practical strategy is to ignore the small-scale [[vortex|vortices]] (or [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]) in the motion and to calculate a large-scale motion with an ''effective'' viscosity, called the \"eddy viscosity\", which characterizes the transport and dissipation of [[energy]] in the smaller-scale flow (see [[large eddy simulation]]).{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=163}}{{sfn|Lesieur|2012|pp=2\u2013}} In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid itself, which must be positive by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], the eddy viscosity can be negative.{{sfn|Sivashinsky|Yakhot|1985|p=1040}}{{sfn|Xie|Levchenko|2019|p=045434}}\n\n==Selected substances==\n[[File:University of Queensland Pitch drop experiment-white bg.jpg|thumb|upright|In the University of Queensland [[pitch drop experiment]], pitch has been dripping slowly through a funnel since 1927, at a rate of one drop roughly every decade.
