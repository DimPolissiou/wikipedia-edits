However, \"[[bison]]\" is a Greek word meaning [[ox]]-like animal, while \"buffalo\" originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts {{lang|fr|b\u0153ufs}}, meaning ox or bullock\u2014so both names, \"bison\" and \"buffalo\", have a similar meaning. Though the name \"bison\" might be considered to be more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage the name \"buffalo\" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison.  In reference to this animal, the term \"buffalo\" dates to 1635 in North American usage when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.  It thus has a much longer history than the term \"bison\", which was first recorded in 1774.<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</ref> The American bison is very closely related to the wisent or [[European bison]].\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Buffalo in the Rain.JPG|thumb|left|Bull at [[North Carolina Zoo]]]]\nIn comparison to [[plains bison]] (the other surviving [[North America]]n subspecies/ecotype), the wood bison is larger and heavier, with large males reaching {{convert|3.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in body length with {{convert|54|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tails and {{convert|201|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall at [[withers]] and {{convert|1179|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}} in weight, making it morphologically more similar to at least one of chronological subspecies of ancestral [[steppe bison]]s (''Bison priscus'' sp.)<ref>Gennady G.

The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]]'s 1909 ''[[Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom]]''.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, [[countershading]], [[disruptive coloration]], and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with [[deimatic displays]]. Both [[Batesian mimicry]] and [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the [[Cuculus canorus|cuckoo]]. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to [[military camouflage]].\n\nCott's textbook was at once well received, being admired both by zoologists and [[natural history|naturalists]] and among [[Allies of World War II|allied soldiers]]. Many officers carried a copy of the book with them in the field. Since the war it has formed the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth of coverage and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.\n\n==The book==\n\n===Approach===\n\n''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' is a 500-page book, {{convert|10|by|7|in}} in its first edition. It was published by Methuen (in London) and Oxford University Press (in New York) in 1940. It is full of detailed observations of types of [[camouflage]] and other uses of [[Animal coloration|colour in animals]], and illustrated by the author with clear drawings and photographs. There is a coloured frontispiece showing eight of Cott's paintings of tropical amphibians. The book has 48 monotone plates and several illustrations.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. Title page.</ref>\n\nCott's method is to provide a large number of examples, illustrated with his own drawings or photographs, showing animals from different groups including fish, reptiles, birds and insects, especially butterflies. The examples are chosen to illustrate specific adaptations. For example, the fish ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'' is described as follows:<ref group=P name=Cott373>Cott, 1940. pp372-373.</ref>\n\n{{quote|this species had the habit of swimming very slowly tail first: but when disturbed it darts rapidly off to safety in the opposite direction... ''C. capistratus'' adopts the same tactics... [This fish] is of particular interest in that the real eye is obliterated and a false eye substituted in one and the same animal.|Hugh Cott<ref group=P name=Cott373/>}}\n\nCott was well aware that he was publishing in wartime. There are, as [[Julian Huxley]] remarks in his 'Introduction', references throughout the book to the human analogues of animal camouflage and concealment. For example, in the section on 'Adaptive Silence', the [[common kestrel|kestrel]] is said to \"practise [[dive-bombing]] attacks\", or \"after the fashion of a fighter 'plane\" to fly down other birds, while \"Owls have solved the problem of the silent air-raid\"; Cott spends the rest of that paragraph on the \"method which has recently been rediscovered and put into practice\" of shutting off a bomber's engines and \"gliding noiselessly down towards their victims\" at Barcelona in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p144.</ref> In the concluding chapter, Cott explicitly states \"The innumerable visible devices used ... in peacetime and in wartime ... are merely rediscovered ... applications of colour that have already reached a high ... degree of specialization and perfection.. in the animal world\", mentioning predator-prey relationships, sexual selection and signalling to rivals. He then compares the \"hunting disguises put on ... as a means of approaching, ambushing or alluring game, and the [[Ghillie suit|sniping suits]], concealed machine-gun posts, and booby traps\" with the camouflage of animal predators; and similarly he compares \"protective disguises\" with the \"photographer's hide and the gunner's observation post.\" In the same section, Cott compares intentionally visible signs with animal warning colours: \"The policeman's white gloves have their parallel in the white stripes or spots of nocturnal [[skunks]] and [[carabid]]s. [[The Automobile Association]] has adopted a system of coloration <nowiki>[black and yellow]</nowiki> whose copyright belongs by priority to wasps and salamanders.\"<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p436.</ref>\n\n===Structure===\nThe book addresses its subject under three main headings: concealment, advertisement, and disguise.\n\n==== Part I: Concealment ====\n[[File:Disruptive Coloration by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35<!--fmt for multiple images-->|Cott's diagrammatic explanation of \"the principle of [[Disruptive coloration|maximum disruptive contrast]], and showing the distractive effect upon the eye of patterns which contrast as violently as possible with the tone of their background\"]]\n\n; The methods by which concealment is attained in nature\n\nCott sets out his view that we have to be re-taught how to see, mentioning [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s \"innocence of the eye\". He argues that camouflage should, and in animals actually does, use four mechanisms: colour resemblance, obliterative shading (i.e. [[countershading]], the graded shading which conceals self-shadowing of the lower body), disruptive coloration, and shadow elimination.\n\nChapter 1. '''General colour resemblance'''. \n:Cott gives many examples such as a table of 16 species of green tropical tree-snakes.\n\nChapter 2. '''Variable colour resemblance'''. Caterpillars and pupae (as in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]]'s [[Camouflage#In zoology|famous experiment]]) are coloured to match their environment. Mountain hares change colour in winter; many fish, cephalopods, frogs, and crustacea can change colour rapidly.\n\nChapter 3. '''Obliterative shading'''. \n:Following the artist and amateur naturalist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]], Cott explains countershading with diagrams, photographs of models and examples of real animals. He shows how helpful it would be for [[military camouflage]] with drawings of gun barrels.\n\nChapter 4. '''Disruptive coloration'''. \n:Cott argues with diagrams, drawings, photographs and examples that animals are often extremely effectively [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]]. He analyses the component effects of disruption, including \"differential blending\" and \"maximum disruptive contrast\". Cott's figure 7 is a set of nine drawings, arranged as a 3x3 table. On the left is an animal's outline in grey tone against a differently coloured background. In the centre, the same animals are now disruptively patterned against the same plain backgrounds. On the right, the disruptively patterned animals are shown against realistic broken backgrounds containing vegetation or rocks. Cott explains\n\n:{{quote|The simplified diagrams in Fig. 7 illustrate the value and effectiveness of maximum disruptive contrasts better than any verbal description... On looking at these drawings from a little distance, it will be seen that the conspicuous patches operate most efficiently in distracting attention from the form of the animals wearing them. By sheer force of their brightness, or blackness, or contrasts, they dominate the picture presented to the eye, apparently destroying their form...<ref group=P name=Cott52>Cott, 1940. p. 52.</ref>}}\n\nCott goes on to explain that the right-hand drawing shows the effect \"of broken surroundings in further blending and confusing the picture\",<ref group=P name=Cott52/> observing that this is the closest to what is seen in nature. His readers are invited to look first at the right-hand images to gain an idea of the power of \"these optical devices\" as camouflage, putting off the moment when the animal is actually recognised.<ref group=P name=Cott53>Cott, 1940. p. 53.</ref>\n\nChapter 5. '''Coincident disruptive coloration'''.\n{{further|Coincident disruptive coloration}}\n:Animals such as frogs are patterned so that when they are at rest with legs tucked in, their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings that seem to flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes too are often [[Disruptive eye mask|hidden in stripes or eye masks]].\n\nChapter 6. '''Concealment Of the shadow'''. \n:Cast shadows give away even well-camouflaged animals. Many animals therefore take care to minimise shadow, by lying down, with flattened bodies, or with fringes. Some hawkmoth caterpillars have false shadow patterns to suggest they are parts of other objects.\n\n; The function of concealing coloration in nature\n\nChapter 7. '''Concealment in defence, mainly as illustrated by birds'''. \n:Cott considers how effective camouflage is as an [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]], such as in incubation and rest (sleep) in birds. For instance nightjars are nocturnal, and rest, well camouflaged, on the ground during the day.\n\nChapter 8. '''Concealment In offence'''. \n:Cott describes the care that predators take when approaching prey, minimizing visible movement and scent, the use of cover for ambush, and \"adaptive silence\".\n\nChapter 9. '''Objections and evidence bearing on the theory of concealing coloration'''. \n:In this chapter Cott discusses various objections to the adaptive (evolutionary) nature of camouflage, and provides evidence to dismiss them. Some are \"based upon such obvious fallacies that they hardly deserve serious consideration.\"\n\nChapter 10. '''The effectiveness of concealing coloration'''. \n:Cott describes simple experiments such as that fish that have changed colour to match a pale background survived better (64% to 42%) on such a background than fish which had not. He also quotes some anecdotal observations on wild animals with similar but not quantified results.\n\n==== Part II: Advertisement ====\n; The methods by which conspicuousness is attained in nature\n<!--yes, Cott restarts his chapter numbers in each Part-->\nChapter 1. '''The appearance and behaviour of aposematic animals'''. \n:Animals that are genuinely distasteful ([[aposematic]]) boldly [[advertising in biology|advertise themselves]] in black, white, red, and yellow. They are often \"sluggish\", not running from predators; gregarious; and diurnal, since warning displays only work if they can be seen \"by potential enemies\".<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 203.</ref>\n\nChapter 2. '''Warning displays'''. \n:Aposematic animals often have ([[Signalling theory|honest]]) threat displays; edible prey sometimes have [[deimatic display|(bluffing) startle displays]]. For example the frilled lizard, ''[[Chlamydosaurus kingii]]'', is illustrated in a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out both sides of the head, making it a startling sight.\n\nChapter 3. '''Adventitious warning coloration'''. \n:Some marine animals select aposematic materials as coverings, not only as camouflage. Some birds nest near wasps' nests.\n\n; Warning coloration in relation to prey\nChapter 4. '''The nature and function of warning coloration, as illustrated by the mammalia'''. \n:Prey like porcupines have warning colours, make noise, and attack predators (even leopards).\n\nChapter 5. '''The Protective Attributes Of Aposematic Animals In General'''. \n:Evidence is given that conspicuous animals such as caterpillars really are distasteful. Animals with actual poisons are discussed, and how these are secreted, used in bites and stings, or kept to make the animal bitter tasting.\n\nChapter 6. '''The relation between warning colours and distasteful attributes'''. \n:Various kinds of evidence are presented for aposematism.\n\nChapter 7. '''The effectiveness of protective attributes associated with warning colours'''. \n:Experimental evidence is presented that insects with warning colours are rejected by predators.\n\n; Warning coloration in reference to predatory enemies\nChapter 8. '''Experimental evidence that vertebrate enemies learn by experience'''. \n:Experiments by Cott show that toads learn to avoid eating stinging bees.\n\nChapter 9. '''Evidence of selective feeding by vertebrate enemies in a state of nature'''. \n:Evidence from wild birds and toads demonstrates preferences for particular prey.\n\n==== Part III: Disguise ====\n[[File:Hugh Cott's Drawing of Disruptively Patterned Potoo.jpg|thumb|Cott's accurate drawing of the [[potoo]], disruptively coloured and perched to resemble a broken branch.]]\n; Special protective and aggressive resemblance\n\nChapter 1. '''Special resemblance to particular objects'''.\n: Cott describes leaf-like fish, chameleons, and insects, and other mimetic forms of camouflage. A liana-like snake near Para (a haunt of [[Henry Walter Bates]] in ''[[Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'') 160 times as long as it was thick is called \"a revelation in the art of aggressive resemblance\".\n\nChapter 2. '''Adaptive behaviour in relation to special cryptic resemblance'''.\n: Animals keep still, sway in the wind, or play dead to assist their camouflage. Poulton's examples of twig-like [[Geometridae]] caterpillars are praised. There are fine photographs of leaf insects, and Cott's admired<ref>{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David | year=2011 | pages=167 | authorlink=David Rothenberg}}</ref> drawing of a poor-me-one or potoo, ''[[Nyctibius griseus]]'', sitting on its nest mimicking a broken branch. Cott explains, in a section on \"Special resemblances in relation to the attitude of rest\"\n\n:{{quote|This wonderful bird ... habitually selects the top of an upright stump as a receptacle for its egg, which usually occupies a small hollow just, and only just, large enough to contain it.... the stump selected had thrown up a new leader just below the point of fracture;... the bird sat facing this in such a way that when viewed from behind they came into line and blended with the grey stem.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 352.</ref>}}\n\nChapter 3. '''Adventitious Concealing Coloration'''.\n: Cott begins by citing [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' with \"until/ Great Birnamwood to the Dunsinane hill/ Shall come against him\" to introduce his chapter on the use of materials as camouflage. Animals from crabs to caterpillars are described.\n\n[[File:Cott Adaptive Coloration Fig 76 Chaetodon capistratus concealed eye, eyespot.jpg|thumb|Cott's art in the service of zoology: the four-eye butterfly fish, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', showing two [[adaptation]]s at once: concealment of the eye, and distraction with an eyespot. Fig. 76 from ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'']]\n; Conspicuous localized characters\nChapter 4. '''Deflective marks'''.\n: Cott describes markings that help to deflect attack, such as the eyespots of butterfly wings and the twitching cast-off tails of lizards, both acknowledged to Poulton,<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. pp. 368, 369.</ref> as well as the distraction displays of birds such as the partridge mentioned by [[Gilbert White]] in his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 371.</ref>\n\nChapter 5. '''Directive marks'''.\n: A selection of lures and deceptive markings are described. A large drawing depicts the [[deimatic]] warning display of a mantis, ''[[Pseudocreobotra wahlbergi]]'' with its spined forelegs raised and large spiral eyespots on its spread wings forming an image \"suggestive of a formidable foe\". Other drawings depict the eyespots of fish such as ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', the four-eye butterfly fish, which are \"usually towards the tail end\" and tending to direct attack away from the head.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 373.</ref>\n\n; Alluring and mimetic resemblances\nChapter 6. '''Alluring coloration'''.\n: The bird-dropping spider ''[[Ornithoscatoides decipiens]]'', the flower mantis ''[[Hymenopus bicornis]]'' and other camouflaged hunters are described.\n\nChapter 7. '''[[Mimicry]]: the attributes of mimics'''.\n: Cott follows Poulton in treating mimicry as basically the same as camouflage or \"adaptive resemblance\". [[Batesian mimicry]] and [[Mullerian mimicry]] are compared. The behaviour of \"Esquimaux seal-hunters\" and First World War Q-ships are mentioned.\n\nChapter 8. '''Breeding parasitism and mimicry in cuckoos'''. \n: The mimicry and behaviour of the European cuckoo, ''[[Cuculus canorus]]'' is analysed.\n\n==== Conclusion ====\n\nThe final chapter confirms that \"The force of the facts and arguments used in this work is cumulative in effect.\" Many small steps of reasoning combine to show that \"adaptive coloration... has been... one of the main achievements of organic [[evolution]].\" The book ends by comparing human artefacts and \"natural adaptations\", both of which can have goals (recall the publication date of 1940, early in the Second World War) including \"the frustration of a [[predator]]y animal or of an [[Nazi Germany|aggressive Power]]\".\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Foreword===\n\n[[Julian S. Huxley]] wrote a foreword (labelled 'Introduction') which defends the [[Darwinian]] concept of [[adaptation]], especially of [[animal coloration|colour (in animals)]] and within that frame of [[mimicry]]. He makes it clear that \"in these last thirty years\" (that is, from about 1910 to 1940) he believed that \"experimental biologists\" professed, even if they did not actually hold, \"a radical scepticism on the subject of adaptations\", in other words about whether [[natural selection]] really could have created the enormous diversity of [[patterns in nature|pattern]] and colour seen in [[nature]].<ref group=P name=Huxley>Cott, 1940. pp vii-ix.</ref> Huxley quoted the now long-forgotten Aaron Franklin Shull's 1936 ''Evolution''<ref name=Shull>Shull, A.F. ''Evolution''. McGraw-Hill, 1936. pp175, 212.</ref> which stated \"These special forms <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sexual selection]], warning colours, mimicry and signalling<nowiki>]</nowiki> of the selection idea... seem destined to be dropped, or at least relegated to very minor places in the Evolution discussion.\", and more sharply that \"aggressive and alluring resemblance\" (Huxley's words) \"must probably be set down as products of fancy belonging to uncritical times.\"<ref name=Shull/> Huxley's reply is simply<ref  group=P name=Huxley/>\n\n{{quote|Dr. Cott, in this important book, has turned the tables with a vengeance on objectors of this type... Had they taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with even a fraction of the relevant facts to be found in nature, they could never have ventured to enunciate such sweeping criticisms: their objections are a measure of their ignorance.|Julian Huxley<ref group=P name=Huxley/>}}\n\nWith objections dismissed, Huxley remarks that \"Dr. Cott is a true follower of Darwin in driving his conclusions home by sheer weight of example,\" observing that \"Faced with his long lists of demonstrative cases, the reader is tempted to wonder why adaptive theories of coloration have been singled out for attack by anti-selectionists.\" Huxley also noted Cott's \"constant cross-reference to human affairs\", and that it was good to know that Cott was applying his principles \"to the practice of camouflage in war\".<ref group=P name=Huxley/>\n\nHuxley concluded his introduction by describing ''Adaptive Coloration'' as \"in many respects the last word on the subject\", upholding the great tradition of \"scientific natural history\".<ref group=P name=Huxley/>\n\n===Contemporary reviews (circa 1940)===\n\nReviewers had little to compare ''Adaptive Coloration'' with. The English zoologist [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], a Darwinian, had written a 360-page book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', fifty years earlier in 1890,<ref>Poulton, 1890.</ref> and he was able, at age 84, to review Cott's work in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' on its appearance in 1940, beginning with the words\n\n{{quote|This excellent work, eagerly awaited for many years, will be most welcome to naturalists, even, we may hope, to the few who have hitherto rejected the [[Natural selection|Darwinian interpretation]] which the author has here supported by a mass of additional evidence based on his own observations and those of very many others.|E.B. Poulton<ref>Poulton, 1940.</ref>}}\n\nThe [[ichthyologist]] [[Carl Leavitt Hubbs]], reviewing the book for ''American Naturalist'' in 1942, began\n\n{{quote|In this Neodarwinian epic Dr. Cott stamps himself as a true disciple of the master evolutionist. Indeed, he rivals [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in the thorough, objective and penetrating analysis of a major biological problem. An immense body of facts and interpretation, much of it original, has been judiciously considered and brought to bear on the question of the biological significance of [[Animal coloration|coloration]].|Carl L. Hubbs<ref name=Hubbs>Hubbs, 1942. pp 318-321.</ref>}}\n\nHubbs notes that Cott is seeming concerned about the scarcity of experimental data for the survival value of camouflage, and accordingly relies on Sumner and Isely's \"clear-cut results\", but at once continues that Cott relies on \"the general lore of natural history\". Hubbs also remarks on the \"resurgence to Darwinian views\", referring to the scepticism about the power of natural selection among both geneticists of the time and to the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckist]] views of [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref name=Hubbs/>\n\nHubbs observes that Cott is both an artist and a naturalist as well as a scientist: \"In section after section, rivaling one another in fascination, this master of art and of natural history unfolds the biological significance of adaptive coloration in animals.\" And Cott's emphasis on disruptive patterning and (following Thayer) [[countershading]] clearly affected the reviewer: \"Particularly impressive is the author's treatment of \"coincident disruptive coloration\", in which a ruptive mark crosses structural boundaries, so as to obliterate visually such ordinarily conspicuous parts as the eye and the limbs. Concealment of an animal's ordinarily telltale shadow is also stressed\". Hubbs's review ends \"This book is the work of an artist, and it is a work of art. Every biologist with an interest in any phase of natural history or evolution should keep it at hand.\"<ref name=Hubbs/>\n\n\"W.L.S.\", reviewing Cott in The [[Geographical Journal]] in 1940, begins with \"In this large and well-illustrated volume the author discusses at length reason or reasons for the various colour patterns found in the animal kingdom.\" The reviewer goes on \"He has presented us with a vast number of facts and observations which are somewhat difficult to analyse.\" However \"W.L.S.\" admits that disruptive coloration \"is discussed at considerable length by Mr. Cott and many remarkable instances of it are considered in detail\". The review ends by mentioning that while biologists (of the 1930s) usually \"reject the influence of Natural Selection in evolution, the facts of adaptive coloration as given in Mr. Cott's work are a strong argument in its favour, and must be given due weight. This is what Mr. Cott claims to have accomplished in a volume which will certainly take its place as a most valuable contribution to zoological literature.\"<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=1788577 | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals by Hugh B.

The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]]'s 1909 ''[[Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom]]''.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, [[countershading]], [[disruptive coloration]], and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with [[deimatic displays]]. Both [[Batesian mimicry]] and [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the [[Cuculus canorus|cuckoo]]. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to [[military camouflage]].\n\nCott's textbook was at once well received, being admired both by zoologists and [[natural history|naturalists]] and among [[Allies of World War II|allied soldiers]]. Many officers carried a copy of the book with them in the field. Since the war it has formed the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth of coverage and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.\n\n==The book==\n\n===Approach===\n\n''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' is a 500-page book, {{convert|10|by|7|in}} in its first edition. It was published by Methuen (in London) and Oxford University Press (in New York) in 1940. It is full of detailed observations of types of [[camouflage]] and other uses of [[Animal coloration|colour in animals]], and illustrated by the author with clear drawings and photographs. There is a coloured frontispiece showing eight of Cott's paintings of tropical amphibians. The book has 48 monotone plates and several illustrations.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. Title page.</ref>\n\nCott's method is to provide a large number of examples, illustrated with his own drawings or photographs, showing animals from different groups including fish, reptiles, birds and insects, especially butterflies. The examples are chosen to illustrate specific adaptations. For example, the fish ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'' is described as follows:<ref group=P name=Cott373>Cott, 1940. pp372-373.</ref>\n\n{{quote|this species had the habit of swimming very slowly tail first: but when disturbed it darts rapidly off to safety in the opposite direction... ''C. capistratus'' adopts the same tactics... [This fish] is of particular interest in that the real eye is obliterated and a false eye substituted in one and the same animal.|Hugh Cott<ref group=P name=Cott373/>}}\n\nCott was well aware that he was publishing in wartime. There are, as [[Julian Huxley]] remarks in his 'Introduction', references throughout the book to the human analogues of animal camouflage and concealment. For example, in the section on 'Adaptive Silence', the [[common kestrel|kestrel]] is said to \"practise [[dive-bombing]] attacks\", or \"after the fashion of a fighter 'plane\" to fly down other birds, while \"Owls have solved the problem of the silent air-raid\"; Cott spends the rest of that paragraph on the \"method which has recently been rediscovered and put into practice\" of shutting off a bomber's engines and \"gliding noiselessly down towards their victims\" at Barcelona in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p144.</ref> In the concluding chapter, Cott explicitly states \"The innumerable visible devices used ... in peacetime and in wartime ... are merely rediscovered ... applications of colour that have already reached a high ... degree of specialization and perfection.. in the animal world\", mentioning predator-prey relationships, sexual selection and signalling to rivals. He then compares the \"hunting disguises put on ... as a means of approaching, ambushing or alluring game, and the [[Ghillie suit|sniping suits]], concealed machine-gun posts, and booby traps\" with the camouflage of animal predators; and similarly he compares \"protective disguises\" with the \"photographer's hide and the gunner's observation post.\" In the same section, Cott compares intentionally visible signs with animal warning colours: \"The policeman's white gloves have their parallel in the white stripes or spots of nocturnal [[skunks]] and [[carabid]]s. [[The Automobile Association]] has adopted a system of coloration <nowiki>[black and yellow]</nowiki> whose copyright belongs by priority to wasps and salamanders.\"<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p436.</ref>\n\n===Structure===\nThe book addresses its subject under three main headings: concealment, advertisement, and disguise.\n\n==== Part I: Concealment ====\n[[File:Disruptive Coloration by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35<!--fmt for multiple images-->|Cott's diagrammatic explanation of \"the principle of [[Disruptive coloration|maximum disruptive contrast]], and showing the distractive effect upon the eye of patterns which contrast as violently as possible with the tone of their background\"]]\n\n; The methods by which concealment is attained in nature\n\nCott sets out his view that we have to be re-taught how to see, mentioning [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s \"innocence of the eye\". He argues that camouflage should, and in animals actually does, use four mechanisms: colour resemblance, obliterative shading (i.e. [[countershading]], the graded shading which conceals self-shadowing of the lower body), disruptive coloration, and shadow elimination.\n\nChapter 1. '''General colour resemblance'''. \n:Cott gives many examples such as a table of 16 species of green tropical tree-snakes.\n\nChapter 2. '''Variable colour resemblance'''. Caterpillars and pupae (as in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]]'s [[Camouflage#In zoology|famous experiment]]) are coloured to match their environment. Mountain hares change colour in winter; many fish, cephalopods, frogs, and crustacea can change colour rapidly.\n\nChapter 3. '''Obliterative shading'''. \n:Following the artist and amateur naturalist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]], Cott explains countershading with diagrams, photographs of models and examples of real animals. He shows how helpful it would be for [[military camouflage]] with drawings of gun barrels.\n\nChapter 4. '''Disruptive coloration'''. \n:Cott argues with diagrams, drawings, photographs and examples that animals are often extremely effectively [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]]. He analyses the component effects of disruption, including \"differential blending\" and \"maximum disruptive contrast\". Cott's figure 7 is a set of nine drawings, arranged as a 3x3 table. On the left is an animal's outline in grey tone against a differently coloured background. In the centre, the same animals are now disruptively patterned against the same plain backgrounds. On the right, the disruptively patterned animals are shown against realistic broken backgrounds containing vegetation or rocks. Cott explains\n\n:{{quote|The simplified diagrams in Fig. 7 illustrate the value and effectiveness of maximum disruptive contrasts better than any verbal description... On looking at these drawings from a little distance, it will be seen that the conspicuous patches operate most efficiently in distracting attention from the form of the animals wearing them. By sheer force of their brightness, or blackness, or contrasts, they dominate the picture presented to the eye, apparently destroying their form...<ref group=P name=Cott52>Cott, 1940. p. 52.</ref>}}\n\nCott goes on to explain that the right-hand drawing shows the effect \"of broken surroundings in further blending and confusing the picture\",<ref group=P name=Cott52/> observing that this is the closest to what is seen in nature. His readers are invited to look first at the right-hand images to gain an idea of the power of \"these optical devices\" as camouflage, putting off the moment when the animal is actually recognised.<ref group=P name=Cott53>Cott, 1940. p. 53.</ref>\n\nChapter 5. '''Coincident disruptive coloration'''.\n{{further|Coincident disruptive coloration}}\n:Animals such as frogs are patterned so that when they are at rest with legs tucked in, their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings that seem to flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes too are often [[Disruptive eye mask|hidden in stripes or eye masks]].\n\nChapter 6. '''Concealment Of the shadow'''. \n:Cast shadows give away even well-camouflaged animals. Many animals therefore take care to minimise shadow, by lying down, with flattened bodies, or with fringes. Some hawkmoth caterpillars have false shadow patterns to suggest they are parts of other objects.\n\n; The function of concealing coloration in nature\n\nChapter 7. '''Concealment in defence, mainly as illustrated by birds'''. \n:Cott considers how effective camouflage is as an [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]], such as in incubation and rest (sleep) in birds. For instance nightjars are nocturnal, and rest, well camouflaged, on the ground during the day.\n\nChapter 8. '''Concealment In offence'''. \n:Cott describes the care that predators take when approaching prey, minimizing visible movement and scent, the use of cover for ambush, and \"adaptive silence\".\n\nChapter 9. '''Objections and evidence bearing on the theory of concealing coloration'''. \n:In this chapter Cott discusses various objections to the adaptive (evolutionary) nature of camouflage, and provides evidence to dismiss them. Some are \"based upon such obvious fallacies that they hardly deserve serious consideration.\"\n\nChapter 10. '''The effectiveness of concealing coloration'''. \n:Cott describes simple experiments such as that fish that have changed colour to match a pale background survived better (64% to 42%) on such a background than fish which had not. He also quotes some anecdotal observations on wild animals with similar but not quantified results.\n\n==== Part II: Advertisement ====\n; The methods by which conspicuousness is attained in nature\n<!--yes, Cott restarts his chapter numbers in each Part-->\nChapter 1. '''The appearance and behaviour of aposematic animals'''. \n:Animals that are genuinely distasteful ([[aposematic]]) boldly [[advertising in biology|advertise themselves]] in black, white, red, and yellow. They are often \"sluggish\", not running from predators; gregarious; and diurnal, since warning displays only work if they can be seen \"by potential enemies\".<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 203.</ref>\n\nChapter 2. '''Warning displays'''. \n:Aposematic animals often have ([[Signalling theory|honest]]) threat displays; edible prey sometimes have [[deimatic display|(bluffing) startle displays]]. For example the frilled lizard, ''[[Chlamydosaurus kingii]]'', is illustrated in a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out both sides of the head, making it a startling sight.\n\nChapter 3. '''Adventitious warning coloration'''. \n:Some marine animals select aposematic materials as coverings, not only as camouflage. Some birds nest near wasps' nests.\n\n; Warning coloration in relation to prey\nChapter 4. '''The nature and function of warning coloration, as illustrated by the mammalia'''. \n:Prey like porcupines have warning colours, make noise, and attack predators (even leopards).\n\nChapter 5. '''The Protective Attributes Of Aposematic Animals In General'''. \n:Evidence is given that conspicuous animals such as caterpillars really are distasteful. Animals with actual poisons are discussed, and how these are secreted, used in bites and stings, or kept to make the animal bitter tasting.\n\nChapter 6. '''The relation between warning colours and distasteful attributes'''. \n:Various kinds of evidence are presented for aposematism.\n\nChapter 7. '''The effectiveness of protective attributes associated with warning colours'''. \n:Experimental evidence is presented that insects with warning colours are rejected by predators.\n\n; Warning coloration in reference to predatory enemies\nChapter 8. '''Experimental evidence that vertebrate enemies learn by experience'''. \n:Experiments by Cott show that toads learn to avoid eating stinging bees.\n\nChapter 9. '''Evidence of selective feeding by vertebrate enemies in a state of nature'''. \n:Evidence from wild birds and toads demonstrates preferences for particular prey.\n\n==== Part III: Disguise ====\n[[File:Hugh Cott's Drawing of Disruptively Patterned Potoo.jpg|thumb|Cott's accurate drawing of the [[potoo]], disruptively coloured and perched to resemble a broken branch.]]\n; Special protective and aggressive resemblance\n\nChapter 1. '''Special resemblance to particular objects'''.\n: Cott describes leaf-like fish, chameleons, and insects, and other mimetic forms of camouflage. A liana-like snake near Para (a haunt of [[Henry Walter Bates]] in ''[[Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'') 160 times as long as it was thick is called \"a revelation in the art of aggressive resemblance\".\n\nChapter 2. '''Adaptive behaviour in relation to special cryptic resemblance'''.\n: Animals keep still, sway in the wind, or play dead to assist their camouflage. Poulton's examples of twig-like [[Geometridae]] caterpillars are praised. There are fine photographs of leaf insects, and Cott's admired<ref>{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David | year=2011 | pages=167 | authorlink=David Rothenberg}}</ref> drawing of a poor-me-one or potoo, ''[[Nyctibius griseus]]'', sitting on its nest mimicking a broken branch. Cott explains, in a section on \"Special resemblances in relation to the attitude of rest\"\n\n:{{quote|This wonderful bird ... habitually selects the top of an upright stump as a receptacle for its egg, which usually occupies a small hollow just, and only just, large enough to contain it.... the stump selected had thrown up a new leader just below the point of fracture;... the bird sat facing this in such a way that when viewed from behind they came into line and blended with the grey stem.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 352.</ref>}}\n\nChapter 3. '''Adventitious Concealing Coloration'''.\n: Cott begins by citing [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' with \"until/ Great Birnamwood to the Dunsinane hill/ Shall come against him\" to introduce his chapter on the use of materials as camouflage. Animals from crabs to caterpillars are described.\n\n[[File:Cott Adaptive Coloration Fig 76 Chaetodon capistratus concealed eye, eyespot.jpg|thumb|Cott's art in the service of zoology: the four-eye butterfly fish, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', showing two [[adaptation]]s at once: concealment of the eye, and distraction with an eyespot. Fig. 76 from ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'']]\n; Conspicuous localized characters\nChapter 4. '''Deflective marks'''.\n: Cott describes markings that help to deflect attack, such as the eyespots of butterfly wings and the twitching cast-off tails of lizards, both acknowledged to Poulton,<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. pp. 368, 369.</ref> as well as the distraction displays of birds such as the partridge mentioned by [[Gilbert White]] in his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 371.</ref>\n\nChapter 5. '''Directive marks'''.\n: A selection of lures and deceptive markings are described. A large drawing depicts the [[deimatic]] warning display of a mantis, ''[[Pseudocreobotra wahlbergi]]'' with its spined forelegs raised and large spiral eyespots on its spread wings forming an image \"suggestive of a formidable foe\". Other drawings depict the eyespots of fish such as ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', the four-eye butterfly fish, which are \"usually towards the tail end\" and tending to direct attack away from the head.<ref group=P>Cott, 1940. p. 373.</ref>\n\n; Alluring and mimetic resemblances\nChapter 6. '''Alluring coloration'''.\n: The bird-dropping spider ''[[Ornithoscatoides decipiens]]'', the flower mantis ''[[Hymenopus bicornis]]'' and other camouflaged hunters are described.\n\nChapter 7. '''[[Mimicry]]: the attributes of mimics'''.\n: Cott follows Poulton in treating mimicry as basically the same as camouflage or \"adaptive resemblance\". [[Batesian mimicry]] and [[Mullerian mimicry]] are compared. The behaviour of \"Esquimaux seal-hunters\" and First World War Q-ships are mentioned.\n\nChapter 8. '''Breeding parasitism and mimicry in cuckoos'''. \n: The mimicry and behaviour of the European cuckoo, ''[[Cuculus canorus]]'' is analysed.\n\n==== Conclusion ====\n\nThe final chapter confirms that \"The force of the facts and arguments used in this work is cumulative in effect.\" Many small steps of reasoning combine to show that \"adaptive coloration... has been... one of the main achievements of organic [[evolution]].\" The book ends by comparing human artefacts and \"natural adaptations\", both of which can have goals (recall the publication date of 1940, early in the Second World War) including \"the frustration of a [[predator]]y animal or of an [[Nazi Germany|aggressive Power]]\".\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Foreword===\n\n[[Julian S. Huxley]] wrote a foreword (labelled 'Introduction') which defends the [[Darwinian]] concept of [[adaptation]], especially of [[animal coloration|colour (in animals)]] and within that frame of [[mimicry]]. He makes it clear that \"in these last thirty years\" (that is, from about 1910 to 1940) he believed that \"experimental biologists\" professed, even if they did not actually hold, \"a radical scepticism on the subject of adaptations\", in other words about whether [[natural selection]] really could have created the enormous diversity of [[patterns in nature|pattern]] and colour seen in [[nature]].<ref group=P name=Huxley>Cott, 1940. pp vii-ix.</ref> Huxley quoted the now long-forgotten Aaron Franklin Shull's 1936 ''Evolution''<ref name=Shull>Shull, A.F. ''Evolution''. McGraw-Hill, 1936. pp175, 212.</ref> which stated \"These special forms <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sexual selection]], warning colours, mimicry and signalling<nowiki>]</nowiki> of the selection idea... seem destined to be dropped, or at least relegated to very minor places in the Evolution discussion.\", and more sharply that \"aggressive and alluring resemblance\" (Huxley's words) \"must probably be set down as products of fancy belonging to uncritical times.\"<ref name=Shull/> Huxley's reply is simply<ref  group=P name=Huxley/>\n\n{{quote|Dr. Cott, in this important book, has turned the tables with a vengeance on objectors of this type... Had they taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with even a fraction of the relevant facts to be found in nature, they could never have ventured to enunciate such sweeping criticisms: their objections are a measure of their ignorance.|Julian Huxley<ref group=P name=Huxley/>}}\n\nWith objections dismissed, Huxley remarks that \"Dr. Cott is a true follower of Darwin in driving his conclusions home by sheer weight of example,\" observing that \"Faced with his long lists of demonstrative cases, the reader is tempted to wonder why adaptive theories of coloration have been singled out for attack by anti-selectionists.\" Huxley also noted Cott's \"constant cross-reference to human affairs\", and that it was good to know that Cott was applying his principles \"to the practice of camouflage in war\".<ref group=P name=Huxley/>\n\nHuxley concluded his introduction by describing ''Adaptive Coloration'' as \"in many respects the last word on the subject\", upholding the great tradition of \"scientific natural history\".<ref group=P name=Huxley/>\n\n===Contemporary reviews (circa 1940)===\n\nReviewers had little to compare ''Adaptive Coloration'' with. The English zoologist [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], a Darwinian, had written a 360-page book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', fifty years earlier in 1890,<ref>Poulton, 1890.</ref> and he was able, at age 84, to review Cott's work in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' on its appearance in 1940, beginning with the words\n\n{{quote|This excellent work, eagerly awaited for many years, will be most welcome to naturalists, even, we may hope, to the few who have hitherto rejected the [[Natural selection|Darwinian interpretation]] which the author has here supported by a mass of additional evidence based on his own observations and those of very many others.|E.B. Poulton<ref>Poulton, 1940.</ref>}}\n\nThe [[ichthyologist]] [[Carl Leavitt Hubbs]], reviewing the book for ''American Naturalist'' in 1942, began\n\n{{quote|In this Neodarwinian epic Dr. Cott stamps himself as a true disciple of the master evolutionist. Indeed, he rivals [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in the thorough, objective and penetrating analysis of a major biological problem. An immense body of facts and interpretation, much of it original, has been judiciously considered and brought to bear on the question of the biological significance of [[Animal coloration|coloration]].|Carl L. Hubbs<ref name=Hubbs>Hubbs, 1942. pp 318-321.</ref>}}\n\nHubbs notes that Cott is seeming concerned about the scarcity of experimental data for the survival value of camouflage, and accordingly relies on Sumner and Isely's \"clear-cut results\", but at once continues that Cott relies on \"the general lore of natural history\". Hubbs also remarks on the \"resurgence to Darwinian views\", referring to the scepticism about the power of natural selection among both geneticists of the time and to the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckist]] views of [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref name=Hubbs/>\n\nHubbs observes that Cott is both an artist and a naturalist as well as a scientist: \"In section after section, rivaling one another in fascination, this master of art and of natural history unfolds the biological significance of adaptive coloration in animals.\" And Cott's emphasis on disruptive patterning and (following Thayer) [[countershading]] clearly affected the reviewer: \"Particularly impressive is the author's treatment of \"coincident disruptive coloration\", in which a ruptive mark crosses structural boundaries, so as to obliterate visually such ordinarily conspicuous parts as the eye and the limbs. Concealment of an animal's ordinarily telltale shadow is also stressed\". Hubbs's review ends \"This book is the work of an artist, and it is a work of art. Every biologist with an interest in any phase of natural history or evolution should keep it at hand.\"<ref name=Hubbs/>\n\n\"W.L.S.\", reviewing Cott in The [[Geographical Journal]] in 1940, begins with \"In this large and well-illustrated volume the author discusses at length reason or reasons for the various colour patterns found in the animal kingdom.\" The reviewer goes on \"He has presented us with a vast number of facts and observations which are somewhat difficult to analyse.\" However \"W.L.S.\" admits that disruptive coloration \"is discussed at considerable length by Mr. Cott and many remarkable instances of it are considered in detail\". The review ends by mentioning that while biologists (of the 1930s) usually \"reject the influence of Natural Selection in evolution, the facts of adaptive coloration as given in Mr. Cott's work are a strong argument in its favour, and must be given due weight. This is what Mr. Cott claims to have accomplished in a volume which will certainly take its place as a most valuable contribution to zoological literature.\"<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=1788577 | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals by Hugh B.

{"title_page": "Mills' constant", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=July 2019}}\nIn [[number theory]], '''Mills' constant''' is defined as the smallest positive [[real number]] ''A'' such that the [[floor function]] of the [[double exponential function]]\n\n:<math> \\lfloor A^{3^{n}} \\rfloor</math>\n\nis a [[prime number]], for all natural numbers ''n''. This constant is named after [[William H. Mills]] who proved in 1947 the existence of ''A'' based on results of [[Guido Hoheisel]] and [[Albert Ingham]] on the [[prime gap]]s.\nIts value is unknown, but if the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true, it is approximately 1.3063778838630806904686144926... {{OEIS|id=A051021|name=Decimal expansion of Mills's constant, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis is true}}.\n\n==Mills primes==\nThe primes generated by Mills' constant are known as Mills primes; if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the sequence begins\n:<math>2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, 16022236204009818131831320183, 4113101149215104800030529537915953170486139623539759933135949994882770404074832568499, \\ldots</math> {{OEIS|A051254}}.\n\nIf ''a<sub>i</sub>'' denotes the ''i''<sup>th</sup> prime in this sequence, then ''a<sub>i</sub>'' can be calculated as the smallest prime number larger than <math>a_{i-1}^3</math>. In order to ensure that rounding <math>A^{3^n}</math>, for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, &hellip;, produces this sequence of primes, it must be the case that <math>a_i < (a_{i-1}+1)^3</math>. The Hoheisel\u2013Ingham results guarantee that there exists a prime between any two sufficiently large [[cubic number]]s, which is sufficient to prove this inequality if we start from a sufficiently large first prime <math>a_1</math>. The Riemann hypothesis implies that there exists a prime between any two consecutive cubes, allowing the ''sufficiently large'' condition to be removed, and allowing the sequence of Mills primes to begin at ''a''<sub>1</sub> = 2.\n\nFor all a > <math>e^{e^{34}}</math>, there is at least one prime between <math>a^3</math> and <math>(a+1)^3</math> {{harv|Dudek|2016}}.

It quickly became a prosperous magnet for lawyers, doctors, other professionals, and merchants. Much of Newnan's prosperity was due to its thriving cotton industry, which relied on [[slavery]].\n\nNewnan was largely untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] due to its status as a hospital city (for both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate troops]]), and as a result still features much [[antebellum architecture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.newnan.ga.us/visitors/history/index.php|title=History|publisher=City of Newnan|website=www.ci.newnan.ga.us|access-date=2019-04-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Celebrated architect Kennon Perry designed many of the town's 20th century homes. During the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Confederate cavalry defeated [[Union Army|Union]] forces at the nearby [[Battle of Brown's Mill]].\n\nOn April 23, 1899, a notorious lynching occurred after an African-American man by the name of [[Sam Hose]] (born Tom Wilkes) was accused of killing his boss, Alfred Cranford. Hose was abducted from police custody, paraded through Newnan, tortured, and burned alive just north of town by a lynch mob of approximately 2,000 citizens of [[Coweta County]].\n\nNewnan was also host to the trial in 1948 of wealthy landowner [[John Wallace (murderer)|John Wallace]], the first white man in the South to be condemned to death by the testimony of [[African American]]s, two field hands who were made to help with burning the body of murdered white sharecropper Wilson Turner. These events were portrayed in the novel ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]''. The film version starred [[Johnny Cash]], [[Andy Griffith]], and [[June Carter]].\n\nIn 1968 [[Kmart]] opened a warehouse in Newnan which slowly established Newnan as a major hub for distribution in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Workers Say Kmart Short-Changed Them|author=Mike Clary|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 31, 1992|access-date=February 23, 2020|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-03-31-mn-53330-story.html}}</ref> Around this time, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] attempted to unionize the warehouse, but the attempt was defeated when the employees voted 329 to 201 in favor of remaining union-free.<ref>''Kmart Corp'', 316 N.L.R.B. 1175 (N.L.R.B. 1995)</ref>  In 2015 the distribution center closed with a loss of 164 jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sears & Kmart closing update, 25 February 2015|author=Aaron Hutchins|publisher=blindbatnews.com|date=February 25, 2015|access-date=February 23, 2020|url=http://www.blindbatnews.com/tag/closings/page/9}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n\nThe city is home to one of the few Georgia counties with a museum that focuses mainly on African American history.

It quickly became a prosperous magnet for lawyers, doctors, other professionals, and merchants. Much of Newnan's prosperity was due to its thriving cotton industry, which relied on [[slavery]].\n\nNewnan was largely untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] due to its status as a hospital city (for both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate troops]]), and as a result still features much [[antebellum architecture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.newnan.ga.us/visitors/history/index.php|title=History|publisher=City of Newnan|website=www.ci.newnan.ga.us|access-date=2019-04-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Celebrated architect Kennon Perry designed many of the town's 20th century homes. During the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Confederate cavalry defeated [[Union Army|Union]] forces at the nearby [[Battle of Brown's Mill]].\n\nOn April 23, 1899, a notorious lynching occurred after an African-American man by the name of [[Sam Hose]] (born Tom Wilkes) was accused of killing his boss, Alfred Cranford. Hose was abducted from police custody, paraded through Newnan, tortured, and burned alive just north of town by a lynch mob of approximately 2,000 citizens of [[Coweta County]].\n\nNewnan was also host to the trial in 1948 of wealthy landowner [[John Wallace (murderer)|John Wallace]], the first white man in the South to be condemned to death by the testimony of [[African American]]s, two field hands who were made to help with burning the body of murdered white sharecropper Wilson Turner. These events were portrayed in the novel ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]''. The film version starred [[Johnny Cash]], [[Andy Griffith]], and [[June Carter]].\n\nIn 1968 [[Kmart]] opened a warehouse in Newnan which slowly established Newnan as a major hub for distribution in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Workers Say Kmart Short-Changed Them|author=Mike Clary|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 31, 1992|access-date=February 23, 2020|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-03-31-mn-53330-story.html}}</ref> Around this time, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] attempted to unionize the warehouse, but the attempt was defeated when the employees voted 329 to 201 in favor of remaining union-free.<ref>''Kmart Corp'', 316 N.L.R.B. 1175 (N.L.R.B. 1995)</ref>  In 2015 the distribution center closed with a loss of 164 jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sears & Kmart closing update, 25 February 2015|author=Aaron Hutchins|publisher=blindbatnews.com|date=February 25, 2015|access-date=February 23, 2020|url=http://www.blindbatnews.com/tag/closings/page/9}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n\nThe city is home to one of the few Georgia counties with a museum that focuses mainly on African American history.
