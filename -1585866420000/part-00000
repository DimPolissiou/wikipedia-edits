There are no natural streams. One of the branches of the Nagykuns\u00e1g Main Channel is located at the border.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and ancient history===\nPalaeolithic man lived in the area, as found in excavations from Kengyel, T\u00farkeve, and T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s. In ancient times, the settlement was a marginal part of the Sarmatians, as their line of defense is the forefront of the Cs\u00f6rsz trench. By indirect evidence, it is likely that the region played an important role in Attila's era, when it was a connection between the central campsite along the Tisza (perhaps the area of Szeged) and the eastern parts of the empire, as it was possible to turn to the passes of the uncharted Tisza to the northeast of the Carpathian Mountains for the first time.\n\n===Age of Conquest===\nMany archaeological finds were found in K\u00e9tp\u00f3, probably Hungarians belonging to the Tarj\u00e1n tribe led by Ond. The mass of the artifacts and the names of the settlements that existed and still exist in the area (Kisp\u00f3, Nagyp\u00f3, Pusztap\u00f3, P\u00f3hamara, P\u00f3halma) indicate that the vicinity of the settlement was an important neighborhood. There are a good number of [[Cuman]]ian names (Kuns, Besenyi, Ulysses) among the people of the area and there are signs of their lives in the surrounding settlements. The area was barely suitable for farming due to its marshy nature, so it is likely that livestock and fishing were the primary products. And at a given time, these conditions are for the Bengal peoples. An outstanding archaeological find from this time is the K\u00e9tp\u00f3 Cup, which proves that there was a prestigious headquarters in this place at the time of the conquest.\n\n===\u00c1rp\u00e1d Age===\nThe tribal center was soon established as a settlement, first mentioned in the V\u00e1radi Regestrum between 1208 and 1235. This is one of the oldest settlements in the county. The Tatar invasion depopulated this area. In 1240\u201342, B\u00e9la with the introduction of the Kuns. At that time, the K\u00e9tp\u00f3 area was one of the southernmost points of the Kun (apart from Kunszentm\u00e1rton), which will play a role in the later religious system.\n\nAt the turn of the 15th century, Sigismund of Luxembourg was fighting against the Turks for Belgrade, so he exchanged it, among others, in the head of the Twin Pole. The master of the estate became [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107|Gy\u00f6rgy Brankovics]], a descendant of the [[Rascians|Rascian]] despot, who had settled a large number of Serbian families in the area. At this time, two settlements have been registered under the name Kisp\u00f3 and Nagyp\u00f3. With their introduction, farming became more dominant in the area.\n\n===Turkish times===\nThe area of Kisp\u00f3 and Nagyp\u00f3 was subject to the castle of T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s, and it was noted that both villages had a church and about 200 to 300 inhabitants. The continual harassment of the Turks and the war with the Tatar troops depopulated the country, which was almost completed by the fifteen-year war between 1591 and 1606. The population started to return only after the peace-making, but the area of the settlements was recorded as a desert. Further losses were caused by the relocation of a significant part of the loyal population to [[Rakamaz]] after the failure of the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi War of Independence]].\n\n===Desert period===\nIn the XVII-XIX centuries, the area of K\u00e9tp\u00f3 was registered as a wilderness attached to Mez\u0151t\u00far.\n\n==Farm System==\nSheep herding was the primary agricultural activity, and animal husbandry was the driving force behind the establishment of accommodations and farms. As animal husbandry was gradually modernized and strengthened in the area of Mez\u0151t\u00far, farmers also appeared in remote areas of the district, so the farm system also developed rapidly. By the end of the 19th century, the farmstead areas were organized according to the type of farming. In 1952, the village of K\u00e9tp\u00f3 (about 1,400 inhabitants) was established from those living on homesteads in the area (nearly 4,000 people). The lands were considered to be very good, because instead of the average threefold, they had yielded five times the yield of each sown seed.\n\n==Religion==\nIn terms of religion, K\u00e9tp\u00f3 was similar to the other settlements of the Nagykuns\u00e1g, where Roman Catholicism was weakly rooted, Eastern Christianity was more typical, and South Slavic settlement was further strengthened. This resulted in the rejection of Catholicism in the Reformation era and the rapid spread of the Reformed Faith.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2001, almost 100% of the population of the settlement declared themselves to be of Hungarian nationality.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ketpo.hu/ Official site] in Hungarian\n\n{{Mez\u0151t\u00far District}}\n{{J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ketpo}}\n[[Category:Populated places in J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|settlement_type        = Village\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = {{HUN}}\n|coordinates            = {{coord|47|04|26|N|20|28|52|E|region:HU|display=inline,title}}\n|image_shield=HUN K\u00e9tp\u00f3 COA.jpg\n\n<!--If coordinates are filled in above remove ed notes from \"Hungary\" in pushpin_map field to display map-->\n|pushpin_map            = Hungary\n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset=+1\n|timezone_DST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+2\n|official_name=K\u00e9tp\u00f3\n|subdivision_type1=[[Counties of Hungary|County]]\n|subdivision_name1=[[J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County|J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok]]\n|subdivision_type2=[[Districts of Hungary|District]]\n|subdivision_name2=[[Mez\u0151t\u00far District|Mez\u0151t\u00far]]\n|area_total_km2=66.76\n|population_as_of=2002\n|population_total=820\n|population_density_km2=12\n|postal_code_type=[[Postal codes in Hungary|Postal code]]\n|postal_code=5411\n|area_code_type=[[Telephone numbers in Hungary|Area code(s)]]\n|area_code=(+36) 56\n}}\n'''K\u00e9tp\u00f3''' is a [[village]] in [[J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok]] county, in the [[Northern Great Plain]] [[region]] of central [[Hungary]]. \n[[Image:K\u00e9tp\u00f3.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Aerial photo: K\u00e9tp\u00f3, palace]]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ketpo city limit sign rovas script.jpg|300px|thumb|right|K\u00e9tp\u00f3 town limit sign in [[Rovas]] script.]] \nK\u00e9tp\u00f3 covers an [[area]] of {{convert|66.76|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and has a [[population]] of 820 people (2002).\nK\u00e9tp\u00f3 is situated in the south-eastern part of J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok county near the villages of T\u00farkeve, Mez\u0151t\u00far, T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s, Kengyel, Mez\u0151h\u00e9k, Tiszateny\u0151, and Kuncsorba.

Alistair is portrayed by [[John Reilly (actor)|John Reilly]] on a recurring basis from August 20, 2007, to May 20, 2008; before Reilly's contract run from January 21, 2005, to July 17, 2006, Alistair was also portrayed by [[David Bailey (actor)|David Bailey]] from September 27, 2004, to January 13, 2005, and by the duo of [[voice acting|voice actor]] [[Alan Oppenheimer]] (November 8, 1999, to September 24, 2004) and [[body double]] Bill Dempsey (November 11, 1999, to September 24, 2004). Alistair was also played by Jordan Baker (April 7 to November 13, 2003) when he was disguised as a woman named Charlie.\n\nAn extremely powerful and wealthy businessman, Alistair is, for the first five years of the program, a mysterious character whose face is never directly seen by the audience.  Upon the recasting of the role with Bailey in 2004, Alistair becomes one of the soap's primary [[villain]]s, expanding his focus from daughter [[Sheridan Crane|Sheridan]] and her lover, [[Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald]], to all of [[Harmony (Passions)|Harmony]]'s citizens. Upon this transformation, many of the most nefarious non-magical schemes in Harmony such as the [[Passions Vendetta|omega plot]] in 2006 and the [[Vincent Clarkson|Blackmailer]]'s reign of terror in 2007 are written as being Alistair's handiwork. Alistair is frequently regarded as being pure [[evil]]; he expresses [[racism|racist]],<ref name=\"14july05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-07-14|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= July 14, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-7-13-05.shtml}}</ref> [[sexism|sexist]],<ref name=\"15july05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-07-15|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= July 15, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-7-14-05.shtml}}</ref><ref name=\"31january2006\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-01-31|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= 22|minutes= |transcript= January 31, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-01-30-06.shtml}}</ref> and [[homophobia|homophobic]] beliefs, and all of his known relationships are based on a [[megalomania]]cal need to control his family members and sexual partners.\n\n==Character history==\n\n===Life before 1999===\nAlistair Ephraim Crane was born into the wealthy, prestigious [[Crane family (Passions)|Crane family]] of [[Harmony (Passions)|Harmony]], [[New England]].  Alistair's parents were cold and unloving, and he grew up to be a bitter and harsh man himself. As a young man, he became engaged to fellow [[socialite]] [[Rachel Barrett (Passions character)|Rachel Barrett]], whom he loved deeply,<ref name=\"21september05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-09-21|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= September 21, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-09-20-05.shtml}}</ref> but when she discovered his true nature, she broke off their engagement.  Unable to let her go, Alistair [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Rachel and faked her death in a [[boating]] accident.\n\nAfter Rachel's apparent death, Alistair married her younger sister, [[Katherine Crane|Katherine]], who was blind to Alistair's dominating nature until after they had married.  Early in their marriage, Katherine gave birth to the couple's son, [[Julian Crane|Julian Linus Crane]], whom Alistair raised and molded in his own image to ensure that the Crane empire would live on. Several years later, when Julian was a teenager, Katherine gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter named [[Sheridan Crane]].\n\nAlistair never loved Katherine and regularly abused her\u2014[[physical abuse|physically]], [[verbal abuse|verbally]], [[psychological abuse|emotionally]], and [[sexual abuse|sexually]]. He also regularly cheated on her with other women, and one such liaison in the 1970s with [[Minor Passions characters#Edna Wallace|Edna Wallace]] resulted in the birth of a daughter, [[Beth Wallace]].  Not all of Alistair's [[extramarital sex|extramarital affairs]] were consensual, however\u2014while visiting Julian in [[Boston]], he [[rape]]d Julian's [[Eve Russell|girlfriend]]'s fourteen-year-old sister, [[Liz Sanbourne]], resulting in the birth of a son, [[Chad Harris]] (later Harris-Crane), whom Liz gave up for adoption.\n\nAlistair was an emotionally distant father; he tolerated Julian as his heir and paid little attention to Sheridan when she was young.  Alistair strove to ready Julian to take over the Crane empire some day in the future and felt that he needed a \"socially acceptable\" wife.  When he learned that Julian had bedded and impregnated an [[African American]] woman, [[Eve Russell|Eve Johnson]], Alistair ordered Julian to leave her and marry [[Ivy Winthrop]], daughter of [[Harrison Winthrop|the state's former governor]], and then had [[Vincent Clarkson|Julian and Eve's son]] kidnapped at birth; he later faked the baby's death, blaming it on Eve's drug and alcohol abuse early in her pregnancy.\n\nSometime in the 1980s, Rachel escaped from Alistair's clutches and confronted him at the mansion, preparing to kill him.  A young Sheridan, however, stabbed Rachel with a [[letter opener]], allowing Alistair to spirit Rachel away to [[Hawaii]] under the care of Otto Krause.  There, Rachel escaped and threw herself off a cliff into the [[Pacific Ocean]]; her body was never recovered, and she was presumed deceased.  Also during that decade, Katherine ran off with Crane employee [[Martin Fitzgerald (Passions)|Martin Fitzgerald]] to [[Mexico]]; Alistair, to save himself and his empire from the humiliation and scandal of Katherine's actions, faked his wife's death and secretly had their marriage [[annulment|annulled]].\n\n===The faceless years, 1999\u20132004===\nFor the soap's first five years, Alistair is a mysterious character whose face is never revealed to the audience; only his torso and hands, usually holding a [[cigar]], are shown, though the back of Alistair's head is occasionally seen.  Alistair's villainous plots usually only pertain to the protection of Crane empire in these years and he spends a great deal of energy trying to keep Julian and grandson [[Ethan Winthrop|Ethan]] under his control.  After Julian repeatedly fails in carrying out his requests, Alistair disinherits him in favor of Ethan in 2000, and then disinherits Ethan later that year when he breaks off his engagement to [[Gwen Winthrop|Gwen Hotchkiss]] in favor of marrying [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane|Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]].\n\nDuring this time, however, Alistair considers the greatest threat to his empire to be Sheridan's relationship with [[Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald]].  Alistair fears that Luis, a [[police officer]] with a deep hatred for the Cranes, will use his position as Sheridan's husband to discover Alistair's secrets and conspires with Julian in 2000 to make Sheridan believe that Luis is using her by fitting an actor with a mask of Luis's face; Luis and Sheridan eventually uncover the plot, but are unable to prove that Alistair is involved.  Luis and Sheridan become engaged, and Alistair, desperate to keep the two apart, resorts to murdering his own daughter in order to keep the two apart.  First, he has Julian and Rebecca poison Sheridan's [[wedding ring]], but when [[Ivy Winthrop|Ivy Crane]] drives her car into St. Margaret Mary's in an attempt to stop Ethan and Theresa's nuptials, the double wedding is called off, and Sheridan is temporarily saved.  Luis and Sheridan choose to go on their [[honeymoon]] to [[Bermuda]] anyway, and while they are out in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] on a boat, they discover that Alistair has planted a [[bomb]] on board; it explodes, and Sheridan is presumably killed in the blast.\n\nMuch to Alistair's chagrin, Sheridan returns to Harmony alive and well in 2002\u2014but, in the intervening time, she has become engaged to Luis's long-missing older brother, [[Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald|Antonio]].  Sheridan and Antonio are married in January 2003, but Sheridan continues [[sexual intercourse|sleeping with]] Luis and eventually becomes pregnant with his child.\n\n[[Image:PASSCharlieBeth04.JPG|left|thumb|Alistair, posing as Charlie, hugs accomplice (and yet-to-be-revealed daughter) [[Beth Wallace]]]]\n\nAlistair then disguises himself as a [[lesbian]] with a grudge against [[blond]]es named Charlie and teams up with Luis's ex-fianc\u00e9e, [[Beth Wallace]], to kidnap Sheridan and hold her prisoner in a pit in Beth's basement until she gives birth.  Sheridan bears a son, whom Beth later names [[Lopez-Fitzgerald family#Third generation|Marty]], in September 2003, and mother and baby are quickly separated from one another.  Beth throws Sheridan into the ocean attached to an [[anchor]], and Alistair drives off a cliff with an empty [[infant car seat]] in the back seat; both \"Charlie\" and Luis and Sheridan's baby are presumed dead, and Beth passes Marty off as her child with Luis.\n\nSheridan is an emotional wreck after the presumed death of her baby, and Alistair convinces the weak-minded Antonio to place his wife in a [[psychiatric ward]] in 2004.  There, Alistair arranges for Sheridan to be administered [[electric shock therapy]] until she forgets her love for Luis; when she finally does remember, Antonio kidnaps her and forces her onto the Crane jet in hopes of leaving Harmony, and Alistair has the plane blown up, unaware that Antonio experiences a change of heart and lets Sheridan leave.  As a result, only Antonio is killed.\n\nLuis and Sheridan flee to Puerto Arena, [[Mexico]], in part to escape Alistair's wrath and in part to bring Luis's youngest sister, [[Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald|Paloma]], home to Harmony. While watching Luis and Sheridan, Alistair realizes that Katherine is living in Puerto Arena with [[Martin Fitzgerald (Passions)|Martin Fitzgerald]] under the aliases of Ellen and Bob Wheeler. Alistair attempts several times to murder the five, but to no avail.\n\n===Reign of terror, 2004\u201306===\nThe Crane patriarch's reign of terror over Harmony's citizens truly begins on September 27, 2004, when viewers glimpse Alistair's face for the first time. Alistair takes great joy in tormenting his newly returned wife and eventually sends Katherine to a Crane compound in the [[North Atlantic]] in early 2005; there, he holds Katherine, along with [[stowaway]]s [[Gwen Winthrop|Gwen]] and [[Bennett and Standish families#Third generation|Jane Winthrop]] and would-be rescuer grandson [[Fox Crane]], captive, rapes Katherine and physically assaults Gwen. Later, when [[DNA]] testing proves Sheridan, and not Beth, to be Marty's biological mother, Alistair assists Beth, who is revealed to be the product of his [[one-night stand]] with former Harmony [[harlot]] [[Edna Wallace]], in escaping the country with his grandson. Sheridan is furious with Luis for refusing to believe her unfounded claims about Marty's maternity, and Luis sets off to find Marty on his own. While he is in [[Tangier]], Alistair has Luis attacked and kidnapped, and holds him prisoner in the same [[Hawaii]]an compound that he had once used to house [[Rachel Barrett (Passions character)|Rachel]]; Alistair then fakes Luis's death in October 2005.\n\nAlistair's softer side is only seen around his beloved granddaughter, Julian's eldest daughter [[Fancy Crane|Fancy]], whom he considers to be his favorite family member and the only \"true Crane\" of the bunch. When Fancy complains to her \"grampy\" of the treatment to which she had been subjected at [[Noah Bennett]]'s hands, Alistair declares war on the [[Bennett family]]; he first has [[Sam Bennett (Passions)|Sam Bennett]] fired from his position as [[chief of police]], which he had held since July 1999, and then has his [[henchman]], [[Spike Lester|Spike]], lead Sam's troubled daughter [[Jessica Bennett (Passions)|Jessica]] into a life of [[psychoactive drugs|drugs]] and [[prostitution]]. When he witnesses Fancy having sex with Noah on the beach, Alistair becomes enraged and has Sam's youngest son arrested on false drug and weapon charges.\n\nIn mid-2005, Alistair also enters into an alliance with [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]], promising to help her retain her ex-fianc\u00e9 [[Ethan Winthrop]] and daughter, Jane, from her archrival, Gwen, in exchange for her services as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]; when Theresa refuses to fulfill her end of the bargain, Alistair rapes her. Still, Theresa's determination to win back Ethan is so great that she marries Alistair on October 3, 2005. In their [[prenup]], Alistair includes provisions that allow him to adopt Theresa and Julian's nine-year-old son, [[Lopez-Fitzgerald family#Third generation|Little Ethan]], and make him his [[heir]], disinheriting the rest of his family. Alistair takes great pleasure in sexually abusing his young wife and flaunts his efforts to turn their son into a \"true Crane\" in her face. After learning of her brother Luis's death, Theresa's thoughts toward her husband become murderous, and she attempts several times to kill Alistair, most notably with a batch of poisoned [[guacamole]] that Ethan ingests instead.\n\nAlistair seems to have finally been put out of commission at his [[New Year's Eve]] party, appropriately themed \"A Murder Is Announced\", when [[Liz Sanbourne]], in retaliation for her rape and subsequent pregnancy at his hands, stabs him in the neck. He lapses into a [[coma]] and is placed into Lyndon Hill Nursing Home sometime between February 27<ref name=\"homedate1\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-02-27|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= 40|minutes= |transcript= February 27, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-02-24-06.shtml}}</ref> and April 13, 2006.<ref name=\"homedate2\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-04-13|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= 73|minutes= |transcript= April 13, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-04-12-06.shtml}}</ref>  At some point during this time, Alistair emerges from his coma and pays the director of the nursing home to keep his recovery quiet; he then has another comatose man fitted with a latex mask of his face in order to convince his enemies that he is still unconscious so that he can carry out his [[Passions Vendetta|omega plot]].<ref name=\"Vendetta\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-06-16|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= |minutes= |transcript= June 16, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-02-24-06.shtml}}</ref>\n\nWith everyone believing him to be in a coma, Alistair disguises himself as a [[monk]] and convinces [[novice]] [[Whitney Russell]] that he is [[God]].

In Alistair's subterranean Roman office, JT Cornell also discovers proof that Alistair and Liz, and not Julian and [[Eve Russell|Eve]], are Chad Harris's parents. Furthermore, because Eve's mother adopted Liz, Chad and Whitney are only adoptive half-cousins, removing the [[social stigma|stigma]] of incest from their relationship and allowing them to be together once more.\n\nAfter his plots are revealed and foiled, Alistair focuses his energy on escaping Rome with Beth and Marty.

Furthermore, he tells Luis that he must impregnate his other granddaughter, [[Pretty Crane|Pretty]], if he ever wants to see Marty, who is revealed to be alive, again, driving another wedge between Luis and Fancy.  When Luis and Fancy reunite, Alistair returns Marty to his mother and orders Sheridan to use the boy to create friction between her ex-fianc\u00e9 and niece.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Esme Vanderheusen]], whose recent lovers, with the exception of Julian, have all been murdered by an unseen culprit, decides to use her \"curse\" to rid Harmony of Alistair.  Alistair quickly realizes Esme's intentions, however; when he tries to rape her, he is stabbed in the back and sees that his assailant is none other than Esme's fifteen-year-old niece, [[Viki (Passions character)|Viki]].  Alistair is taken to the hospital and arrested for Chad's murder, but he refuses to name Viki as his attempted murderer, preferring to use the seemingly innocent young girl as an [[assassination|assassin]]; Viki's attempts to murder Ethan Winthrop, however, fail, and Alistair is sent to prison pending his trial.\n\nIn May 2008, [[Eve Russell]] is driven to the breaking point regarding Alistair's treatment of her son, Vincent, and decides to kill the Crane patriarch. However, Julian intervenes, seeking to prevent his love from a prison sentence and shoots his father at point blank range in the chest. Fatally wounded, Alistair moans for Eve's help, but the wound is too deep. As Alistair dies, Julian recalls all of his victims. Alistair's last words are to his son; \"I gave you life; it's not fair that you should take mine\".<ref>Alistair's last words on the May 20, 2008, episode before his death.</ref> Alistair's death fulfills the prophecy of [[witch]] [[Tabitha Lenox]] that this is the first of the signs of the destruction of [[Harmony (Passions)|Harmony]]. As Julian was getting arrested it was revealed the gun he shot Alistair with was full of blanks and someone else killed him, not Julian. It was shown, to the audience only, Viki really shot him at the same time Julian did from afar.\n\n==Personality==\n{{Rquote|right|'''[[Fancy Crane|Fancy]]:''' I know how evil you really are.

Instead of marking her for death as he did to other descendants who had stood up to him, Alistair has a mind-control device implanted into Fancy's nose, seeking to regain \"his\" Fancy.<ref name=\"chip\" /> The only other person he apparently loved was Rachel Barrett.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlistair's position as the head of a multibillion-dollar corporation and the patriarch of one of the wealthiest families in the world has led the contents of Alistair's [[will (law)|will]] to play significantly into several of the program's storylines. From 1999\u20132000, [[Julian Crane|Julian]], as Alistair's eldest child and only known son, is the [[heir apparent]] to the Crane empire. Alistair eventually grows disgusted by Julian's behavior, however, and disinherits Julian in favor of Julian's firstborn child and son, [[Ethan Winthrop|Ethan Crane]], in 2000; after Ethan breaks his engagement to [[Gwen Hotchkiss]] in order to marry [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]] later that year, Alistair also disinherits Ethan, leaving the title of heir apparent up for grabs.\n\nAs of the series finale in August 2008, Alistair has ten living biological and adoptive descendants\u2014children Julian Crane and [[Sheridan Crane|Sheridan Lopez-Fitzgerald]] and grandchildren [[Vincent Clarkson]], [[Fancy Crane]], [[Pretty Crane]], [[Miles Harris-Crane]], [[Endora Lenox]], [[James Boothe]], and [[Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald]]. Vincent fakes his death in 2007, and, despite the fact that the tradition of [[primogeniture]] would make him, Alistair's eldest son's eldest son, the heir apparent, the fact that Vincent is [[African American]], a [[hermaphrodite]], and a confessed [[murder]]er, [[rape|rapist]], and [[arson]]ist (although these crimes were at Alistair's behest) would all likely persuade Alistair to bypass Vincent when selecting an heir. [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] also prejudiced Alistair against [[Chad Harris-Crane|Chad]], and Alistair never seriously considers him, nor his son, Miles, as a possibility for heir. Furthermore, Julian is not publicly known to be Endora's father, though Alistair is aware of the girl's paternity and status as a half-[[witch]], and it is therefore highly unlikely that Alistair has included her in his will.\n\nUpon his October 2005 wedding to Theresa, Alistair disinherits all of his relatives\u2014then including Julian, Sheridan, [[Beth Wallace|Beth]], Chad, Fancy, Pretty, [[Fox Crane|Fox]], Endora, Marty, and Miles\u2014aside from Julian and Theresa's son [[Ethan Crane|Little Ethan]], whom he adopts, and makes Little Ethan his sole heir; his other descendants are only to receive money from their [[trust fund]]s and from working at Crane Industries.<ref name=\"will\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-10-03|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= October 3, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-10-03-05.shtml}}</ref>  A year later, Sheridan adopts a son, James, and it is assumed that James meets the same fate as his mother and is not included in Alistair's will.\n\nAlistair's will becomes especially important once it is revealed that Little Ethan, whom Alistair adopted on the belief that he was a Crane, was fathered by [[Ethan Winthrop]] and not Julian.

Alistair is portrayed by [[John Reilly (actor)|John Reilly]] on a recurring basis from August 20, 2007, to May 20, 2008; before Reilly's contract run from January 21, 2005, to July 17, 2006, Alistair was also portrayed by [[David Bailey (actor)|David Bailey]] from September 27, 2004, to January 13, 2005, and by the duo of [[voice acting|voice actor]] [[Alan Oppenheimer]] (November 8, 1999, to September 24, 2004) and [[body double]] Bill Dempsey (November 11, 1999, to September 24, 2004). Alistair was also played by Jordan Baker (April 7 to November 13, 2003) when he was disguised as a woman named Charlie.\n\nAn extremely powerful and wealthy businessman, Alistair is, for the first five years of the program, a mysterious character whose face is never directly seen by the audience.  Upon the recasting of the role with Bailey in 2004, Alistair becomes one of the soap's primary [[villain]]s, expanding his focus from daughter [[Sheridan Crane|Sheridan]] and her lover, [[Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald]], to all of [[Harmony (Passions)|Harmony]]'s citizens. Upon this transformation, many of the most nefarious non-magical schemes in Harmony such as the [[Passions Vendetta|omega plot]] in 2006 and the [[Vincent Clarkson|Blackmailer]]'s reign of terror in 2007 are written as being Alistair's handiwork.

Alistair's parents were cold and unloving, and he grew up to be a bitter and harsh man himself. As a young man, he became engaged to fellow [[socialite]] [[Rachel Barrett (Passions character)|Rachel Barrett]], whom he loved deeply,<ref name=\"21september05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-09-21|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= September 21, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-09-20-05.shtml}}</ref> but when she discovered his true nature, she broke off their engagement.  Unable to let her go, Alistair [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Rachel and faked her death in a [[boating]] accident.\n\nAfter Rachel's apparent death, Alistair married her younger sister, [[Katherine Crane|Katherine]], who was blind to Alistair's dominating nature until after they had married.  Early in their marriage, Katherine gave birth to the couple's son, [[Julian Crane|Julian Linus Crane]], whom Alistair raised and molded in his own image to ensure that the Crane empire would live on. Several years later, when Julian was a teenager, Katherine gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter named [[Sheridan Crane]].\n\nAlistair never loved Katherine and regularly abused her\u2014[[physical abuse|physically]], [[verbal abuse|verbally]], [[psychological abuse|emotionally]], and [[sexual abuse|sexually]]. He also regularly cheated on her with other women, and one such liaison in the 1970s with [[Minor Passions characters#Edna Wallace|Edna Wallace]] resulted in the birth of a daughter, [[Beth Wallace]].  Not all of Alistair's [[extramarital sex|extramarital affairs]] were consensual, however\u2014while visiting Julian in [[Boston]], he [[rape]]d Julian's [[Eve Russell|girlfriend]]'s fourteen-year-old sister, [[Liz Sanbourne]], resulting in the birth of a son, [[Chad Harris]] (later Harris-Crane), whom Liz gave up for adoption.\n\nAlistair was an emotionally distant father; he tolerated Julian as his heir and paid little attention to Sheridan when she was young.  Alistair strove to ready Julian to take over the Crane empire some day in the future and felt that he needed a \"socially acceptable\" wife.  When he learned that Julian had bedded and impregnated an [[African American]] woman, [[Eve Russell|Eve Johnson]], Alistair ordered Julian to leave her and marry [[Ivy Winthrop]], daughter of [[Harrison Winthrop|the state's former governor]], and then had [[Vincent Clarkson|Julian and Eve's son]] kidnapped at birth; he later faked the baby's death, blaming it on Eve's drug and alcohol abuse early in her pregnancy.\n\nSometime in the 1980s, Rachel escaped from Alistair's clutches and confronted him at the mansion, preparing to kill him.  A young Sheridan, however, stabbed Rachel with a [[letter opener]], allowing Alistair to spirit Rachel away to [[Hawaii]] under the care of Otto Krause.  There, Rachel escaped and threw herself off a cliff into the [[Pacific Ocean]]; her body was never recovered, and she was presumed deceased.  Also during that decade, Katherine ran off with Crane employee [[Martin Fitzgerald (Passions)|Martin Fitzgerald]] to [[Mexico]]; Alistair, to save himself and his empire from the humiliation and scandal of Katherine's actions, faked his wife's death and secretly had their marriage [[annulment|annulled]].\n\n===The faceless years, 1999\u20132004===\nFor the soap's first five years, Alistair is a mysterious character whose face is never revealed to the audience; only his torso and hands, usually holding a [[cigar]], are shown, though the back of Alistair's head is occasionally seen.  Alistair's villainous plots usually only pertain to the protection of Crane empire in these years and he spends a great deal of energy trying to keep Julian and grandson [[Ethan Winthrop|Ethan]] under his control.  After Julian repeatedly fails in carrying out his requests, Alistair disinherits him in favor of Ethan in 2000, and then disinherits Ethan later that year when he breaks off his engagement to [[Gwen Winthrop|Gwen Hotchkiss]] in favor of marrying [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane|Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]].\n\nDuring this time, however, Alistair considers the greatest threat to his empire to be Sheridan's relationship with [[Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald]].  Alistair fears that Luis, a [[police officer]] with a deep hatred for the Cranes, will use his position as Sheridan's husband to discover Alistair's secrets and conspires with Julian in 2000 to make Sheridan believe that Luis is using her by fitting an actor with a mask of Luis's face; Luis and Sheridan eventually uncover the plot, but are unable to prove that Alistair is involved.  Luis and Sheridan become engaged, and Alistair, desperate to keep the two apart, resorts to murdering his own daughter in order to keep the two apart.  First, he has Julian and Rebecca poison Sheridan's [[wedding ring]], but when [[Ivy Winthrop|Ivy Crane]] drives her car into St. Margaret Mary's in an attempt to stop Ethan and Theresa's nuptials, the double wedding is called off, and Sheridan is temporarily saved.  Luis and Sheridan choose to go on their [[honeymoon]] to [[Bermuda]] anyway, and while they are out in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] on a boat, they discover that Alistair has planted a [[bomb]] on board; it explodes, and Sheridan is presumably killed in the blast.\n\nMuch to Alistair's chagrin, Sheridan returns to Harmony alive and well in 2002\u2014but, in the intervening time, she has become engaged to Luis's long-missing older brother, [[Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald|Antonio]].  Sheridan and Antonio are married in January 2003, but Sheridan continues [[sexual intercourse|sleeping with]] Luis and eventually becomes pregnant with his child.\n\n[[Image:PASSCharlieBeth04.JPG|left|thumb|Alistair, posing as Charlie, hugs accomplice (and yet-to-be-revealed daughter) [[Beth Wallace]]]]\n\nAlistair then disguises himself as a [[lesbian]] with a grudge against [[blond]]es named Charlie and teams up with Luis's ex-fianc\u00e9e, [[Beth Wallace]], to kidnap Sheridan and hold her prisoner in a pit in Beth's basement until she gives birth.  Sheridan bears a son, whom Beth later names [[Lopez-Fitzgerald family#Third generation|Marty]], in September 2003, and mother and baby are quickly separated from one another.  Beth throws Sheridan into the ocean attached to an [[anchor]], and Alistair drives off a cliff with an empty [[infant car seat]] in the back seat; both \"Charlie\" and Luis and Sheridan's baby are presumed dead, and Beth passes Marty off as her child with Luis.\n\nSheridan is an emotional wreck after the presumed death of her baby, and Alistair convinces the weak-minded Antonio to place his wife in a [[psychiatric ward]] in 2004.  There, Alistair arranges for Sheridan to be administered [[electric shock therapy]] until she forgets her love for Luis; when she finally does remember, Antonio kidnaps her and forces her onto the Crane jet in hopes of leaving Harmony, and Alistair has the plane blown up, unaware that Antonio experiences a change of heart and lets Sheridan leave.  As a result, only Antonio is killed.\n\nLuis and Sheridan flee to Puerto Arena, [[Mexico]], in part to escape Alistair's wrath and in part to bring Luis's youngest sister, [[Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald|Paloma]], home to Harmony. While watching Luis and Sheridan, Alistair realizes that Katherine is living in Puerto Arena with [[Martin Fitzgerald (Passions)|Martin Fitzgerald]] under the aliases of Ellen and Bob Wheeler. Alistair attempts several times to murder the five, but to no avail.\n\n===Reign of terror, 2004\u201306===\nThe Crane patriarch's reign of terror over Harmony's citizens truly begins on September 27, 2004, when viewers glimpse Alistair's face for the first time. Alistair takes great joy in tormenting his newly returned wife and eventually sends Katherine to a Crane compound in the [[North Atlantic]] in early 2005; there, he holds Katherine, along with [[stowaway]]s [[Gwen Winthrop|Gwen]] and [[Bennett and Standish families#Third generation|Jane Winthrop]] and would-be rescuer grandson [[Fox Crane]], captive, rapes Katherine and physically assaults Gwen. Later, when [[DNA]] testing proves Sheridan, and not Beth, to be Marty's biological mother, Alistair assists Beth, who is revealed to be the product of his [[one-night stand]] with former Harmony [[harlot]] [[Edna Wallace]], in escaping the country with his grandson. Sheridan is furious with Luis for refusing to believe her unfounded claims about Marty's maternity, and Luis sets off to find Marty on his own. While he is in [[Tangier]], Alistair has Luis attacked and kidnapped, and holds him prisoner in the same [[Hawaii]]an compound that he had once used to house [[Rachel Barrett (Passions character)|Rachel]]; Alistair then fakes Luis's death in October 2005.\n\nAlistair's softer side is only seen around his beloved granddaughter, Julian's eldest daughter [[Fancy Crane|Fancy]], whom he considers to be his favorite family member and the only \"true Crane\" of the bunch. When Fancy complains to her \"grampy\" of the treatment to which she had been subjected at [[Noah Bennett]]'s hands, Alistair declares war on the [[Bennett family]]; he first has [[Sam Bennett (Passions)|Sam Bennett]] fired from his position as [[chief of police]], which he had held since July 1999, and then has his [[henchman]], [[Spike Lester|Spike]], lead Sam's troubled daughter [[Jessica Bennett (Passions)|Jessica]] into a life of [[psychoactive drugs|drugs]] and [[prostitution]]. When he witnesses Fancy having sex with Noah on the beach, Alistair becomes enraged and has Sam's youngest son arrested on false drug and weapon charges.\n\nIn mid-2005, Alistair also enters into an alliance with [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]], promising to help her retain her ex-fianc\u00e9 [[Ethan Winthrop]] and daughter, Jane, from her archrival, Gwen, in exchange for her services as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]; when Theresa refuses to fulfill her end of the bargain, Alistair rapes her. Still, Theresa's determination to win back Ethan is so great that she marries Alistair on October 3, 2005. In their [[prenup]], Alistair includes provisions that allow him to adopt Theresa and Julian's nine-year-old son, [[Lopez-Fitzgerald family#Third generation|Little Ethan]], and make him his [[heir]], disinheriting the rest of his family. Alistair takes great pleasure in sexually abusing his young wife and flaunts his efforts to turn their son into a \"true Crane\" in her face. After learning of her brother Luis's death, Theresa's thoughts toward her husband become murderous, and she attempts several times to kill Alistair, most notably with a batch of poisoned [[guacamole]] that Ethan ingests instead.\n\nAlistair seems to have finally been put out of commission at his [[New Year's Eve]] party, appropriately themed \"A Murder Is Announced\", when [[Liz Sanbourne]], in retaliation for her rape and subsequent pregnancy at his hands, stabs him in the neck. He lapses into a [[coma]] and is placed into Lyndon Hill Nursing Home sometime between February 27<ref name=\"homedate1\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-02-27|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= 40|minutes= |transcript= February 27, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-02-24-06.shtml}}</ref> and April 13, 2006.<ref name=\"homedate2\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-04-13|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= 73|minutes= |transcript= April 13, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-04-12-06.shtml}}</ref>  At some point during this time, Alistair emerges from his coma and pays the director of the nursing home to keep his recovery quiet; he then has another comatose man fitted with a latex mask of his face in order to convince his enemies that he is still unconscious so that he can carry out his [[Passions Vendetta|omega plot]].<ref name=\"Vendetta\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2006-06-16|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= |minutes= |transcript= June 16, 2006, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2006/pass-trans-02-24-06.shtml}}</ref>\n\nWith everyone believing him to be in a coma, Alistair disguises himself as a [[monk]] and convinces [[novice]] [[Whitney Russell]] that he is [[God]].

Theresa, along with Chad, Whitney, [[Rebecca Hotchkiss|Rebecca]], and Gwen, beg Alistair to allow them to dial [[9-1-1]], but he refuses, and he and Chad engage in a struggle for his gun; Alistair then shoots Chad in the chest, murdering his own son on August 28.<ref name=\"Chad\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2007-08-28|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= |minutes= |transcript= August 28, 2007, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2007/pass-trans-08-28-07.shtml}}</ref>  Ethan eventually pulls through, but Alistair reminds Theresa that he is her legal husband and, fearful of being made a laughingstock for making a non-Crane his heir, threatens to harm her if she tells anyone about Little Ethan's paternity.\n\nAlistair is also horrified to learn that his beloved Fancy is in a relationship with Luis.

Furthermore, he tells Luis that he must impregnate his other granddaughter, [[Pretty Crane|Pretty]], if he ever wants to see Marty, who is revealed to be alive, again, driving another wedge between Luis and Fancy.  When Luis and Fancy reunite, Alistair returns Marty to his mother and orders Sheridan to use the boy to create friction between her ex-fianc\u00e9 and niece.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Esme Vanderheusen]], whose recent lovers, with the exception of Julian, have all been murdered by an unseen culprit, decides to use her \"curse\" to rid Harmony of Alistair.  Alistair quickly realizes Esme's intentions, however; when he tries to rape her, he is stabbed in the back and sees that his assailant is none other than Esme's fifteen-year-old niece, [[Viki (Passions character)|Viki]].  Alistair is taken to the hospital and arrested for Chad's murder, but he refuses to name Viki as his attempted murderer, preferring to use the seemingly innocent young girl as an [[assassination|assassin]]; Viki's attempts to murder Ethan Winthrop, however, fail, and Alistair is sent to prison pending his trial.\n\nIn May 2008, [[Eve Russell]] is driven to the breaking point regarding Alistair's treatment of her son, Vincent, and decides to kill the Crane patriarch. However, Julian intervenes, seeking to prevent his love from a prison sentence and shoots his father at point blank range in the chest. Fatally wounded, Alistair moans for Eve's help, but the wound is too deep. As Alistair dies, Julian recalls all of his victims. Alistair's last words are to his son; \"I gave you life; it's not fair that you should take mine\".<ref>Alistair's last words on the May 20, 2008, episode before his death.</ref> Alistair's death fulfills the prophecy of [[witch]] [[Tabitha Lenox]] that this is the first of the signs of the destruction of [[Harmony (Passions)|Harmony]]. As Julian was getting arrested it was revealed the gun he shot Alistair with was full of blanks and someone else killed him, not Julian. It was shown, to the audience only, Viki really shot him at the same time Julian did from afar.\n\n==Personality==\n{{Rquote|right|'''[[Fancy Crane|Fancy]]:''' I know how evil you really are.

For many years, he uses the threat of disinheritance to force Julian and Ethan to do his bidding and attempts to murder his own daughter, Sheridan, when she disobeys him and accepts Luis's [[marriage proposal|proposal]].  Alistair's frequent use of [[rape]], against his three main \"romantic\" interests \u2013 Rachel, Katherine, and Theresa \u2013 also indicates his love of power over his sexual partners.\n\nOf all of his descendants, the only person that Alistair has ever loved is his eldest granddaughter, [[Fancy Crane]].<ref name=\"6july05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-07-06|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= July 6, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-7-05-05.shtml}}</ref>  Believing her to be the only \"true Crane\" of all of his relatives and admiring her spirit<ref name=\"spirit\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2007-08-22|began= |ended= |season= 8|number= |minutes= |transcript= August 22, 2007, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2007/pass-trans-08-22-07.shtml}}</ref> and ability to stand up to him,<ref name=\"12july05\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-07-12|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= July 12, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-7-11-05.shtml}}</ref> Alistair served as a [[father figure]] to the young girl, who was largely ignored by her parents, and indulged and encouraged her nonchalant, fun-seeking attitude, telling her that she was born to \"enjoy [herself and] have fun\".<ref name=\"fun\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-07-15|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= July 14, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-07-14-05.shtml}}</ref>  It is not until Alistair turns on her and sets lions loose on her and Luis in Rome that Fancy finally sees the true Alistair.<ref name=\"lions\" />  When Alistair is revealed to be alive in 2007, Fancy rebels against him, refusing to conform to his wishes and denying him control.

From 1999-2000, [[Julian Crane|Julian]], as Alistair's eldest child and only known son, is the [[heir apparent]] to the Crane empire. Alistair eventually grows disgusted by Julian's behavior, however, and disinherits Julian in favor of Julian's firstborn child and son, [[Ethan Winthrop|Ethan Crane]], in 2000; after Ethan breaks his engagement to [[Gwen Hotchkiss]] in order to marry [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]] later that year, Alistair also disinherits Ethan, leaving the title of heir apparent up for grabs.\n\nAs of the series finale in August 2008, Alistair has ten living biological and adoptive descendants\u2014children Julian Crane and [[Sheridan Crane|Sheridan Lopez-Fitzgerald]] and grandchildren [[Vincent Clarkson]], [[Fancy Crane]], [[Pretty Crane]], [[Miles Harris-Crane]], [[Endora Lenox]], [[James Boothe]], and [[Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald]]. Vincent fakes his death in 2007, and, despite the fact that the tradition of [[primogeniture]] would make him, Alistair's eldest son's eldest son, the heir apparent, the fact that Vincent is [[African American]], a [[hermaphrodite]], and a confessed [[murder]]er, [[rape|rapist]], and [[arson]]ist (although these crimes were at Alistair's behest) would all likely persuade Alistair to bypass Vincent when selecting an heir. [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] also prejudiced Alistair against [[Chad Harris-Crane|Chad]], and Alistair never seriously considers him, nor his son, Miles, as a possibility for heir. Furthermore, Julian is not publicly known to be Endora's father, though Alistair is aware of the girl's paternity and status as a half-[[witch]], and it is therefore highly unlikely that Alistair has included her in his will.\n\nUpon his October 2005 wedding to Theresa, Alistair disinherits all of his relatives\u2014then including Julian, Sheridan, [[Beth Wallace|Beth]], Chad, Fancy, Pretty, [[Fox Crane|Fox]], Endora, Marty, and Miles\u2014aside from Julian and Theresa's son [[Ethan Crane|Little Ethan]], whom he adopts, and makes Little Ethan his sole heir; his other descendants are only to receive money from their [[trust fund]]s and from working at Crane Industries.<ref name=\"will\">{{cite episode |title= |episodelink= |url= |series= Passions|serieslink= Passions|credits= |network= NBC|station= |city= |airdate= 2005-10-03|began= |ended= |season= 7|number= |minutes= |transcript= October 3, 2005, episode|transcripturl=http://www.tvmegasite.net:8080/day/passions/transcripts/older/2005/pass-trans-10-03-05.shtml}}</ref>  A year later, Sheridan adopts a son, James, and it is assumed that James meets the same fate as his mother and is not included in Alistair's will.\n\nAlistair's will becomes especially important once it is revealed that Little Ethan, whom Alistair adopted on the belief that he was a Crane, was fathered by [[Ethan Winthrop]] and not Julian.

He debuted in the [[graphic novel]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Watchmen]]'', published in 1986 and 1987. The Comedian was created by writer [[Alan Moore]] with artist [[Dave Gibbons]]. As with most of the main characters in the series, he was an analogue for a [[Charlton Comics]] character, in this case the [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]]. Moore imagined the Comedian as a mix between the Peacemaker with \"a little bit of [[Nick Fury]]\" and \"probably a bit of the standard [[Captain America]] patriotic hero-type\".<ref>Cooke, Jon B. [https://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html \"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\"]. ''Comic Book Artist'' #9</ref>\n\n==Character background==\n===Events of ''Watchmen''===\nThe story of ''Watchmen'' starts with the aftermath of Edward Blake's murder in 1985.  Fellow crimefighter [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]], independently investigating the murder, discovers that Blake was in fact the Comedian. The main plot of ''Watchmen'' initially involves Rorschach's suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes (\"masks\"); his continuing investigation into Blake's murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian appearances in ''Watchmen'' consist of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s of the other characters, and is also mentioned in ''Under The Hood'', the fictional [[autobiography]] of Hollis Mason (Nite Owl I) that appears in ''Watchmen'' issues 1\u20133.\n\nThe Comedian was a [[cigar]]-chomping, gun-toting [[vigilante]]-turned-[[paramilitary]] agent. When he first became a costumed adventurer in 1939, he dressed in a [[clown]]-like costume with a simple [[domino mask]]. A brutal [[vigilante]], Blake manages to expunge most [[organized crime]] from the [[New York City|New York]] harbor. He became the youngest member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes. After a photography shoot, he attempts to rape fellow Minuteman [[Silk Spectre]]; she escapes only when another Minuteman, [[List_of_Watchmen_characters#Hooded_Justice|Hooded Justice]], interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was expelled from the group&mdash;but Silk Spectre's agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do to the group's image. He impregnated Silk Spectre with her daughter and successor, Laurie, during a secret, consensual encounter years later. In the 1940s, Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light [[body armor]], adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small [[smiley|happy face]] button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in [[World War II]], becoming a war hero in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]]. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered.<ref>''Watchmen'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original [[Nite Owl]], had published his autobiography ''Under the Hood'' by this point and in it disclosed the Comedian's sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebusters by Captain Metropolis, but he quickly ruined the older hero's hopes of a new team by mocking him, and pointing out that old fashioned crime fighting methods would not save the world from nuclear war.<ref>''Before Watchmen: Minuteman'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nAlongside [[Doctor Manhattan]], the Comedian played a major role in the United States' [[Vietnam War|war with]] [[Vietnam]]. Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the [[North Vietnam]]ese to surrender, Blake was confronted by his lover, a pregnant Vietnamese woman; she is referred to as \"Liao Lin\" in [[David Hayter]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' draft.<ref name=\"Watchmendraft0\">[[David Hayter|Hayter, David]]. ''[http://www.sendspace.com/file/dhl9pk WATCHMEN --3rd draft--]''. September 26, 2003. Accessed on December 8, 2008. 21.</ref> He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her, but the attack left his face permanently disfigured with a scar running from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. After this incident, he began wearing a leather [[gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]]-style mask when dressed as the Comedian.<ref>''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them \"retired\" in anonymity; while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and the Comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government. Blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered, even going so far as to suggest to members of President Nixon's staff that he had killed [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] before they could reveal the details of the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as being behind the execution of [[John F. Kennedy]] (on Nixon's orders). The [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.<ref>''Watchmen'' #4. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIt was during his return from a government mission in 1984 that Blake discovered the island where Adrian Veidt ([[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]]) was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy New York City. Shocked and appalled by what he finds, Blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals Veidt's plan. He drunkenly breaks into [[List of Watchmen characters#Moloch the Mystic|Edgar Jacobi's]] house and cryptically describes the plan, knowing Jacobi will not understand but not realizing Veidt has the bedroom bugged. Veidt, to ensure that Blake does not compromise his operation, confronts Blake in his high-rise apartment and throws Blake out of the window, killing him.<ref>''Watchmen'' #1. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Watchmen'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Before Watchmen''===\nIn ''Before Watchmen: The Minutemen'' #1, additional details are revealed about the Comedian while material from the main story is somewhat [[retcon]]ned. It is revealed that the Comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault. Unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the Minutemen, he is shown to be driven by [[greed]] and an inherent love for violence. In particular, he assaults a [[bartender]] after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register. The issue also implies Blake may have been a victim of severe [[child abuse]] as he claims that a \"caseworker\" told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts, though Blake's status as an [[unreliable narrator]] makes the claim uncertain.<ref>Before Watchmen: The Minutemen #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #1 rewrites the character's back-story further. It is revealed that Blake was close personal friends with [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] as well as [[Jackie Kennedy]]. This contradicts the main ''Watchmen'' series, which cast Edward Blake as a close personal friend of [[Richard Nixon]] (for whom he had worked as an assassin). The mini-series reveals that Blake was responsible for the murder of [[Marilyn Monroe]] (ordered by Jackie Kennedy, behind her husband's back) as well as revealing that, despite strong innuendo from both Blake and Ozymandias,<ref>Watchmen #10, 12</ref> that he did not kill John Kennedy and was attempting to confront [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]] when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination, including Kennedy's death, which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief.<ref>''Before Watchmen: The Comedian'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> It is implied that a former FBI agent with a resemblance to Blake may have been behind it.<ref>Before Watchmen: Comedian #6. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Events of ''Doomsday Clock''===\nIn the sequel comic book ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', the Comedian seemingly turns up alive when he confronts Ozymandias at the time when he was in the DC Universe meeting with [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #2 (December 2017).

He makes himself known by shooting [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Typhoon|Typhoon]] in the face. While pursuing them, he evades [[Giganta]]'s attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, the Comedian catches up to them, planning to use them to find Ozymandias. Before the Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette's rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on the Comedian.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref> As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with the Comedian and the Lantern Battery.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018).

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n== Character inspiration and origin of name==\nAlan Moore has stated that the Comedian, besides his comic book inspirations, was also based on [[G. Gordon Liddy]], a former FBI agent and a figure in the [[Watergate scandal]] as the chief operative in the [[White House Plumbers]] unit during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]].<ref>[http://www.essentialwebcomics.com/showcase/reviews-and-commentaries/143-the-story-behind-the-watchmen The Story Behind The Watchmen, by Joshua McConnaughey] 06-06-2011, Essential Webcomics</ref> Liddy was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping for his role in the scandal.<ref name=\"Newton2003\">{{cite book|author=Michael Newton|title=The FBI Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYkYAAAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1718-6|page=196}}</ref> Moore imagined the Comedian as Liddy with \"comic book muscles\".<ref>Cooke, Jon B. [https://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html \"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\"]. ''Comic Book Artist'' #9</ref> \n\nIn the comic, [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] explains that Blake's moniker of \"The Comedian\" stems from his cynical and arguably selfish world perspective that \"in an insane world\", one can only laugh, as if everything is \"a joke\". Moore took the idea of the name from [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[The Comedians (novel)|The Comedians]]''.<ref>Cooke, Jon B. [https://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html \"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\"].

Blake was proficient with his [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] [[handgun|pistol]], [[MAC-10]] [[submachine gun]] and [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]], and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures ([[flamethrower]]s, [[grenade launcher]]s, etc.). His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare.\n\n==The smiley face badge==\n[[File:WatchmenBloodySmiley.png|thumb|right|150px|The Comedian's badge in the 2009 film]]\nThroughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the \"[[smiley face]]\" button which is closely associated with him, and has become the iconic symbol of the Watchmen series as a whole. At the beginning of the series, the button is smeared with a single drop of blood which, if the button is viewed as a clock face, is at the position of the minute hand of the [[Doomsday Clock]] at the time of the series, five minutes to midnight.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n*The Comedian appears in ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', portrayed by [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.superherohype.com/news/watchmennews.php?id=6056  Watchmen Cast Confirmed!\" superherohype.com; ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''; July 26, 2007]</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n*The Comedian appears in a [[cutscene]] in ''[[Watchmen: The End Is Nigh]]'', voiced by Mark Silverman.\n\n===Motion comics===\n*The Comedian appears in ''[[Watchmen: Motion Comic]]'', where he, along with every other character in the series, is voiced by [[Tom Stechschulte]].<ref name=\"IMDbref\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1322240/|title=\"Watchmen\" (2008) TV Series|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Watchmen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Commedian, The}}\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:United States-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Watchmen characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=The_Comedian_Watchmen.jpg\n|caption=Textless variant cover of ''[[Before Watchmen: Comedian]]'' #1 (June [[2012 in comics|2012]]).<br>Art by [[Jim Lee]].\n|character_name=The Comedian\n|real_name=Edward Morgan Blake\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut = ''[[Watchmen]]'' #1 (September [[1986 in comics|1986]])\n| creators = [[Alan Moore]]<br /> [[Dave Gibbons]]\n|alliances=\n|previous_alliances=[[United States]] government<br>Crimebusters<br>Minutemen\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n* [[Hand-to-hand combat]]\n* Firearms\n* Espionage\n|}}\n'''Comedian''' ('''Edward Morgan Blake''') is a fictional character.

Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the [[North Vietnam]]ese to surrender, Blake was confronted by his lover, a pregnant Vietnamese woman; she is referred to as \"Liao Lin\" in [[David Hayter]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' draft.<ref name=\"Watchmendraft0\">[[David Hayter|Hayter, David]]. ''[http://www.sendspace.com/file/dhl9pk WATCHMEN --3rd draft--]''. September 26, 2003. Accessed on December 8, 2008. 21.</ref> He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her, but the attack left his face permanently disfigured with a scar running from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. After this incident, he began wearing a leather [[gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]]-style mask when dressed as the Comedian.<ref>''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them \"retired\" in anonymity; while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and the Comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government. Blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered, even going so far as to suggest to members of President Nixon's staff that he had killed [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] before they could reveal the details of the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as being behind the execution of [[John F. Kennedy]] (on Nixon's orders). The [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.<ref>''Watchmen'' #4. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIt was during his return from a government mission in 1984 that Blake discovered the island where Adrian Veidt ([[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]]) was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy New York City. Shocked and appalled by what he finds, Blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals Veidt's plan. He drunkenly breaks into [[List of Watchmen characters#Moloch the Mystic|Edgar Jacobi's]] house and cryptically describes the plan, knowing Jacobi will not understand but not realizing Veidt has the bedroom bugged. Veidt, to ensure that Blake does not compromise his operation, confronts Blake in his high-rise apartment and throws Blake out of the window, killing him.<ref>''Watchmen'' #1. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Watchmen'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Before Watchmen''===\nIn ''Before Watchmen: The Minutemen'' #1, additional details are revealed about the Comedian while material from the main story is somewhat [[retcon]]ned. It is revealed that the Comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault. Unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the Minutemen, he is shown to be driven by [[greed]] and an inherent love for violence. In particular, he assaults a [[bartender]] after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register. The issue also implies Blake may have been a victim of severe [[child abuse]] as he claims that a \"caseworker\" told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts, though Blake's status as an [[unreliable narrator]] makes the claim uncertain.<ref>Before Watchmen: The Minutemen #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #1 rewrites the character's back-story further. It is revealed that Blake was close personal friends with [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] as well as [[Jackie Kennedy]]. This contradicts the main ''Watchmen'' series, which cast Edward Blake as a close personal friend of [[Richard Nixon]] (for whom he had worked as an assassin). The mini-series reveals that Blake was responsible for the murder of [[Marilyn Monroe]] (ordered by Jackie Kennedy, behind her husband's back) as well as revealing that, despite strong innuendo from both Blake and Ozymandias,<ref>Watchmen #10, 12</ref> that he did not kill John Kennedy and was attempting to confront [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]] when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination, including Kennedy's death, which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief.<ref>''Before Watchmen: The Comedian'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> It is implied that a former FBI agent with a resemblance to Blake may have been behind it.<ref>Before Watchmen: Comedian #6. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Events of ''Doomsday Clock''===\nIn the sequel comic book ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', the Comedian seemingly turns up alive when he confronts Ozymandias at the time when he was in the DC Universe meeting with [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #2 (December 2017). DC Comics.</ref> It is revealed that Doctor Manhattan has captured the Comedian from moments before his death, causing him to wash ashore outside the city of Metropolis and greeting him.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.</ref> The Comedian continues on the trail of Mime and Marionette.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> He catches up to [[Joker (character)|Joker]], Mime, and Marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by [[Riddler]] to discuss the Superman Theory. He makes himself known by shooting [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Typhoon|Typhoon]] in the face. While pursuing them, he evades [[Giganta]]'s attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, the Comedian catches up to them, planning to use them to find Ozymandias. Before the Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette's rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on the Comedian.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref> As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with the Comedian and the Lantern Battery.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Upon catching up with Ozymandias and shooting him, [[Lex Luthor]] shoots the Comedian with a device which returns him to the moment he was taken from, leaving him to die.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12 (December 2019). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n== Character inspiration and origin of name==\nAlan Moore has stated that the Comedian, besides his comic book inspirations, was also based on [[G. Gordon Liddy]], a former FBI agent and a figure in the [[Watergate scandal]] as the chief operative in the [[White House Plumbers]] unit during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]].<ref>[http://www.essentialwebcomics.com/showcase/reviews-and-commentaries/143-the-story-behind-the-watchmen The Story Behind The Watchmen, by Joshua McConnaughey] 06-06-2011, Essential Webcomics</ref> Liddy was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping for his role in the scandal.<ref name=\"Newton2003\">{{cite book|author=Michael Newton|title=The FBI Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYkYAAAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1718-6|page=196}}</ref> Moore imagined the Comedian as Liddy with \"comic book muscles\".<ref>Cooke, Jon B. [https://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html \"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\"]. ''Comic Book Artist'' #9</ref> \n\nIn the comic, [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] explains that Blake's moniker of \"The Comedian\" stems from his cynical and arguably selfish world perspective that \"in an insane world\", one can only laugh, as if everything is \"a joke\". Moore took the idea of the name from [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[The Comedians (novel)|The Comedians]]''.<ref>Cooke, Jon B. [https://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html \"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\"]. ''Comic Book Artist'' #9</ref>\n\nNotably, the scene containing Blake\u2019s funeral has a large caption that reads \u201cABSENT FRIENDS.\u201d This is a reference to Elvis Costello\u2019s \"The Comedians,\" which contains the line \u201cI should be drinking a toast to absent friends instead of these comedians.\u201d This implies that we, the audience should not mourn Blake{{cn|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Comedian was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition, even at the time of his death at the age of 61. Blake was proficient with his [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] [[handgun|pistol]], [[MAC-10]] [[submachine gun]] and [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]], and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures ([[flamethrower]]s, [[grenade launcher]]s, etc.). His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare.\n\n==The smiley face badge==\n[[File:WatchmenBloodySmiley.png|thumb|right|150px|The Comedian's badge in the 2009 film]]\nThroughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the \"[[smiley face]]\" button which is closely associated with him, and has become the iconic symbol of the Watchmen series as a whole. At the beginning of the series, the button is smeared with a single drop of blood which, if the button is viewed as a clock face, is at the position of the minute hand of the [[Doomsday Clock]] at the time of the series, five minutes to midnight.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n*The Comedian appears in ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', portrayed by [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.superherohype.com/news/watchmennews.php?id=6056  Watchmen Cast Confirmed!\" superherohype.com; ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''; July 26, 2007]</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n*The Comedian appears in a [[cutscene]] in ''[[Watchmen: The End Is Nigh]]'', voiced by Mark Silverman.\n\n===Motion comics===\n*The Comedian appears in ''[[Watchmen: Motion Comic]]'', where he, along with every other character in the series, is voiced by [[Tom Stechschulte]].<ref name=\"IMDbref\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1322240/|title=\"Watchmen\" (2008) TV Series|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Watchmen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Commedian, The}}\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:United States-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Watchmen characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2), 1-3 \u2192 1\u20133", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(character)"}

He is an amoral character who considers himself superior to others and exploits them to suit his purposes. He believes in reason and [[materialism]], eschewing all religion and superstition, believing them to be impediments to human evolution; he looks down on anyone who does not hold his beliefs as inferior and exploitable, especially his Catholic neighbors.

Although the rest of the townspeople hold him in contempt for his anti-Catholic sentiments and violent nature, they live in fear of him for his physical prowess and ability to best any man in a fight. The only people with whom Joe shares even a cordial relationship are his wife, Lenita, best friend Anthony, and Anthony's fianc\u00e9e, Terezinha, whom Joe lusts for. Believing himself to be of intellectual superiority to those around him, Joe's primary drive is \"the continuity of blood\" in the form of a son born from \"the perfect woman\". After learning that Lenita cannot conceive, Joe kills her with a venomous tarantula, then murders Anthony by drowning him in a bathtub. Both deaths are ruled accidental and Joe makes advances on Terezinha, who turns him down. An enraged Joe rapes her, but Terezinha commits suicide rather than report him, though she promises vengeance from beyond the grave. On [[Dia de los Muertos|Dia de Finados]], Joe witnesses a procession of [[ghosts]] who chase him to Anthony and Terezinha's tomb, where he witnesses their bodies coming to life. Later, the townspeople find Joe on the tomb steps, apparently dead, with his eyes bulging from their sockets. \n\nJoe returns in ''[[This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse]]'', in which it is revealed that he survived his encounter with Terezinha and Anthony's ghosts, though he was temporarily blinded. After recovering and going to trial, he is found not guilty for his crimes and returns to his mortuary business. Still desiring a son, he orders his henchman, Bruno, to begin kidnapping women from the town that he has dubbed superior, subjecting them to a series of tortures to see who endures. A woman named Marcia seems impervious to fear or pain, prompting Joe to declare her his \"perfect woman\", though she rebuffs him when he tries to make love to her while listening to the rest of the women being fatally bitten by venomous snakes. Joe permits her to leave alive, then sets his sights on Laura, the [[atheist]] daughter of a prominent colonel. Sharing Coffin Joe's beliefs, the pair become lovers, and Joe conspires to blame his crimes on the Colonel's protege. Although Laura becomes pregnant, both she and their son die in childbirth. Meanwhile, Marcia, wracked with guilt, confesses her experiences, and a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] forms to pursue Joe. They chase him to a swamp, where he is shot. As Joe sinks into the water, a priest offers him salvation, and Joe agrees to die as a Christian before apparently drowning.\n\nJoe returns again in ''[[Embodiment of Evil]]'', with a flashback revealing that Joe only momentarily faked his death, surfacing seconds later to deny God and mock the priest before blinding him with his fingernails. Captured and tried for murder, Joe is sentenced to 40 years in prison before being released onto the streets of 2008 [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. Reuniting with Bruno, Joe discovers that a [[cult]] has formed around his teachings and beliefs. Joe begins dispatching his followers to bring him women, whom he subjects to mental and physical torture; several women voluntarily fall under his sway, including a [[eugenicist]]. Throughout the ordeal, Joe is haunted by visions of his past victims, as well as disturbing hallucinations foretelling his own death. Meanwhile, Joe is pursued by a fervently Catholic police captain and a mentally unhinged priest named Father Eugenio, the son of one of his victims. The pair ultimately pursue Joe to an abandoned amusement park, where he succeeds in killing the captain before himself being stabbed to death with a crucifix by Father Eugenio. In an epilogue, Joe's followers congregate at his graveside, where it is revealed that several of the women are pregnant.\n\n===Appearance in other films===\nJoe appears as the [[Horror host|host]] of the 1968 [[anthology film]] ''[[The Strange World of Coffin Joe]]'', introducing the film's segments. \n\nJoe appears as a fictional character in the 1970 film ''[[Awakening of the Beast]]'', in which test subjects dosed with [[LSD]] have hallucinations of him after viewing a movie poster for ''The Strange World of Coffin Joe''. \n\n''[[The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe]]'' is a [[metafilm]] about Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins being haunted by the character, who has come to life as an [[avatar]] of Satan. \n\n''[[The Strange Hostel of Naked Pleasures]]'' features a character strongly implied to be Coffin Joe, here operating as the proprietor of an ambiguously haunted [[hostel]].\n\nHe again returns as a fictional character in ''[[Hallucinations of a Deranged Mind]]'', in which a scientist seeks out the help of Marins after being haunted by dreams in which Coffin Joe abducts his wife. The film is partially composed of [[deleted scenes]] from previous Coffin Joe movies.\n\n===As a horror host===\nMarins has often appeared in character as Coffin Joe in the role of a [[horror host]].\n\nFrom 1967 to 1988, Marins hosted the program ''Al\u00e9m, Muito Al\u00e9m do Al\u00e9m'' (''Beyond, Much Beyond the Beyond'') Fridays on [[TV Bandeirantes]], in character as Coffin Joe, presenting short horror tales written by author and screenwriter [[R.

Castille came to Marins' attention for his comedic short film ''The Blind Date of Coffin Joe'', a parody of the first two films in the trilogy in which Joe\u2014played by Castille and living in modern-day [[America]]\u2014attempts to find the perfect woman through [[internet dating]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coffin Joe}}\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Fictional torturers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional serial killers]]\n[[Category:Fictional undertakers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in horror film]]\n[[Category:Male horror film villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional Brazilian people]]\n[[Category:Horror film series]]\n[[Category:Horror hosts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{primary|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #000000\n| name               = Z\u00e9 do Caix\u00e3o\n| image              = Carnaval 2018 (39518305154).jpg\n| caption            = Coffin Joe's float in the 2018 [[Carnival of S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| first_major        = [[At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul]]\n| first_date         = 1964\n| last_major         = [[Embodiment of Evil]]\n| last_date          = 2008\n| creator            = [[Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins]]\n| portrayer          = Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins\n| alias              = Josefel Zanatas\n| species            = Human\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Undertaker\n| nationality        = Brazilian\n}}\n'''Z\u00e9 do Caix\u00e3o''' {{IPA-pt|\u02c8z\u025b du kaj.\u02c8\u0283\u0250\u0303\u00f5|}}, known in English-speaking countries as '''Coffin Joe''', is a character created and nominally played by Brazilian writer, director, and actor [[Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins]].

Eventually, Todd reveals to Margaret that he had been using her, and Margaret is furious when she hears that Todd is engaged to and in love with Blair. Having fallen in love with Todd, Margeret is now obsessed with him. Deciding that she cannot let Todd and Blair be together, Margaret creates a fake photo of herself in bed with Todd and shows it to Blair, claiming that she and Todd have been sleeping together. Eventually, Blair realizes that Margaret is lying. and everyone in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] sees that Margaret is mentally unstable. Margaret kidnaps Todd and Blair's son [[Jack Manning (One Life to Live)|Jack]], and then Kevin's adopted son [[AJ Chandler|Ace]]. She is caught by the police and placed in a mental institution.\n\nMonths later, Margaret is released as her doctors decide that she has been given the help that she needed. Margaret, however, has been faking her sanity; still obsessed with Todd, she appears on his wedding day to ex-wife Blair.
