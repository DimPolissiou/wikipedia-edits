Along with the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, the Grand Cross was founded on  10 March 1813, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  It was renewed in 1870 for the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and again in 1914 for [[World War I]].  In 1939, when [[Adolf Hitler]] renewed the Iron Cross as a German (rather than strictly Prussian) decoration, he also renewed the Grand Cross.\n\nThe Grand Cross of the Iron Cross was twice the size of the Iron Cross and was worn from a ribbon around the neck.
