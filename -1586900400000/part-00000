The federal government shares [[sovereignty]] with the [[U.S. state|state]] governments.\n\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch is headed by the president and is formally independent of both the legislature and the judiciary. The [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] serves as a set of advisers to the president. They include the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and heads of the executive departments. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] of Congress, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The judicial branch (or [[judiciary]]), composed of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, exercises judicial power. The judiciary's function is to interpret the [[United States Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's structure is [[Codified constitution|codified]] in the Constitution.\n\nTwo [[political parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], have [[Two-party system|dominated]] American politics since the [[American Civil War]], although several [[List of political parties in the United States|much smaller parties]] also exist. Generally, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is also known as the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] party within the United States, while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is also known as a [[Centre-right politics|center-right]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party.\n\nThere are a few major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed [[democracies]]. These include greater power in the [[upper house]] of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive and the dominance of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other democratically run developed countries; this is because of a combination of stringent historic controls. These controls take shape in the form of [[State law (United States)|state]] and [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal]] laws, informal [[Censorship in the United States|media prohibitions]] and [[First-past-the-post voting|winner-take-all]] elections and include [[ballot access]] issues and [[United States presidential debates|exclusive debate rules]]. There have been five [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote]].\n\n==Political culture==\n{{main|Political culture of the United States}}\nScholars from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] to the present have found a strong continuity in core American political values since the time of the [[American Revolution]] in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Samuel P. Huntington|title= American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1Qd0VCmhMC&pg=PA21|year= 1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=21\u20137|isbn= 9780674030213}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial origins===\n{{main|Colonial history of the United States}}\nSome of Britain's North American colonies became exceptional in the European world for their vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p. 281</ref> Reasons for this [[American exceptionalism]] included:\n\n# [[Suffrage]] was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.  While fewer than 20% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. However, only 6% of Americans were entitled to vote at the foundation of the republic. While the roots of democracy were apparent, nevertheless deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.<ref>Richard R. Beeman, \"The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America,\" ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311\u201340</ref> That deference declined sharply with the American Revolution.\n# In each colony, elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments, decided a wide range of public and private business.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi,''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp. 281\u20132</ref> Topics of public concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Americans spent a great deal of time in court, as private lawsuits were very common. Legal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries, with a central role for trained lawyers. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, and the dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s, as attested by the careers of [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], among many others.<ref>[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], ''The Rise of the legal profession in America'' (2 vol. 1965), vol. 1.</ref>\n# The North American colonies were exceptional in the world context because of the growth of representation of different [[Interest group (disambiguation)|interest groups]].  Unlike in Europe, where royal courts, aristocratic families and  established churches exercised control, the American political culture was open to merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and many other identifiable groups.  Over 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts, unlike in the United Kingdom where it was common to have an absentee member of Parliament.\n# Americans became fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.<ref>Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp. 281\u201386</ref>\n\nNone of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power.\n\n===American ideology===\n[[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], along with a form of [[classical liberalism]], remains the dominant ideology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cal Jillson|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIFCXTqMnMQC&pg=PA14|year=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=14|isbn=9781136875083}}</ref> Central documents include the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (1776), [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] (1787), ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' (1788), [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] (1791), and [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] (1863) and the first Civil Rights Act (1865), among others. The political scientist [[Louis Hartz]] articulated this theme in American political culture in ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955). Hartz saw the antebellum South as breaking away from this central ideology in the 1820s as it constructed a fantasy to support hierarchical, feudal society. Others, such as [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] of the libertarian, Alabama-based Mises Institute argue that the secessionists who formed the Confederacy in 1861 retained the values of classical liberalism.<ref>Hartz, Louis.

Shalhope, \"Republicanism and Early American Historiography,\" William and Mary Quarterly, 39 (April 1982), pp. 334\u201356 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918756 in JSTOR]{{Registration required}}</ref>\n* [[Citizenship in the United States|Civic duty]]: Citizens have the responsibility to understand and support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, and perform military service.\n* Opposition to [[Political corruption]]\n* [[Democracy]]: The government is answerable to citizens, who may change the representatives through elections.\n* [[Equality before the law]]: The laws should attach no special privilege to any citizen. Government officials are subject to the law just as others are\n* [[Freedom of religion]]: The government can neither support nor suppress religion\n* [[Freedom of speech]]: The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal speech of a citizen; a [[marketplace of ideas]]\n\nIn response to Hartz and others, political scientist Rogers M. Smith argued in ''Civic Ideals'' (1999) that in addition to liberalism and republicanism, United States political culture has historically served to exclude various populations from access to full citizenship. Terming this ideological tradition \"ascriptive inegalitarianism,\" Smith traces its relevance in nativist, sexist, and racist beliefs and practices alongside struggles over citizenship laws from the early colonial period to the [[Progressive Era]], and further political debates in the following century.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Civic Ideals {{!}} Yale University Press|url = http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300078770/civic-ideals|website = yalebooks.com|access-date = February 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the United States' founding, agriculture and small private businesses dominated the economy, and state government left welfare issues to private or local initiative. Laissez-faire ideology was largely abandoned in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, laissez-faire ideology, as explained especially by [[Milton Friedman]], has once more become a powerful force in American politics.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, B.

According to American historian [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] (writing in 1956), \"Liberalism in the American usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any European country, save possibly Britain\".  Liberalism in Canada also has a similar usage as in the United States. Schlesinger noted that American liberalism does not support [[classical liberalism]]'s commitment to [[limited government]] and [[laissez-faire]] economics.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\">[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] (1956) from: The Politics of Hope (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).</ref> Because those two positions are instead generally supported by American conservatives, historian [[Leo P.

Ribuffo, \"20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy\", ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2\u20136, quote on p. 6</ref>\n\nIn American politics, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is commonly known as the dominant [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] national party, while the smaller [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] is known for being closer to the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[anti-capitalist]] [[left-wing]] of modern American politics. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is commonly known as the dominant [[centre-right politics|center-right]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] national party, and the alternative [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] attracts some independent-leaning voters who tend to be more [[social liberal]] on [[social issues]] and [[fiscally conservative]] on [[economic policy]].\n\n===Suffrage===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{main|Voting rights in the United States}}\nThe right of [[suffrage]] is nearly universal for citizens eighteen years of age and older. All states and the [[District of Columbia]] contribute to the electoral vote for president. However, the District, and other U.S. holdings like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]], lack federal representation in Congress. These constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas. Each commonwealth, territory, or district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's suffrage]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshistory.org/resources/general/woman-suffrage-movement|title=The Woman Suffrage Movement|website=National Women's History Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> became an important issue after the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-65. After the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1870, giving African-American men the right to vote, various women's groups wanted the right to vote as well. Two major interest groups formed. The first group was the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], formed by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], that wanted to work for suffrage on the federal level and to push for more governmental changes, such as the granting of property rights to married women.<ref>Ellen Carol Dubois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'' (1998)</ref> The second group, the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] formed by [[Lucy Stone]], aimed to give women the right to vote.<ref>Andrea Moore Kerr, ''Lucy Stone: speaking out for equality'' (1992) ch 1</ref>  In 1890, the two groups merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). The NAWSA then mobilized to obtain support state-by-state, and by 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified, giving women the right to vote <ref>Paul D. Buchanan, ''American Women's Rights Movement: A Chronology of Events'' (2009) p. 129</ref> although universal suffrage was only realised in 1964 with the 24th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n[[Student activism]] against the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s prompted the passage of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which lowered the [[voting age]] from twenty-one to eighteen, the legal age of the [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft]].\n\n==State government==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|State governments of the United States}}\n[[State governments of the United States|States governments]] have the power to make laws that are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in the [[U.S. Constitution]] for all citizens. These include [[education]], [[family law]], [[contract law]], and most [[crime]]s. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.\n\nLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected [[Governor (United States)|governor]], who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for [[Nebraska]], which has [[Unicameral|unicameral legislature]], all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the [[Senate]] and the lower house called the [[House of Representatives]], the [[House of Delegates (disambiguation)|House of Delegates]], [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.\n\nThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government. However, state constitutions are generally more detailed.\n\n==Local government==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|Urban politics in the United States}}\nThe United States has 89,500 local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts that deal with issues like fire protection.<ref>''Statistical Abstract: 2010'' p. 416.</ref> Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan\u2014local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.<ref>Ann O'M. Bowman and Richard C. Kearney, ''State and Local Government: The Essentials'' (2008) p. 78</ref>\n\nAbout 28% of the people live in cities of 100,000 or more population. City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the [[municipal government]]. The [[United States Constitution]] only provides for [[U.S. state|states]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]] as subdivisions of the country, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has accordingly [[Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh|confirmed]] the [[Dillon's rule|supremacy of state sovereignty over municipalities]]. For most big cities, cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents. Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. However, almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs.  Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.\n\nThere are three general types of city government: the [[Mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council]], the commission, and the [[Council\u2013manager government|council\u2013manager]]. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.\n\n===Mayor-council===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThis is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials, sometimes with the approval of the council. He or she has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city) and often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.\n\n===Commission===\nThis combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected citywide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talgov.com/commission |title=City Commission |publisher=Talgov.com |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Council-manager===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.\n\nThe city manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his or her work.\n\n===County government===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe [[county (United States)|county]] is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always) containing two or more [[township (United States)|townships]] and several villages. New York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county in its own right. On the other hand, [[Arlington County, Virginia]], the United States' smallest county, located just across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed by a unitary county administration. In other cities, both the city and county governments have merged, creating a [[consolidated city\u2013county]] government.\n\nIn most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the [[county seat]], and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a [[sole commissioner]], who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections. In some [[New England]] states, counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land.\n\n===Municipal government===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governments. These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management. In many states of the US, the term ''town'' does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how [[civil township]]s are used in other states.\n\nThe government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council, which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council, board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners. The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer, or there may be an elected mayor. Governmental employees may include a clerk, treasurer, police and fire officers, and health and welfare officers.\n\nOne unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the [[New England]] region of the United States, is the [[town meeting]]. Once a year, sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws for operating the government. As a body, they decide on road construction and repair, construction of public buildings and facilities, tax rates, and the town budget.

Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] or [[Canada]].\n\nFundraising plays a large role in getting a candidate elected to public office. Without money, a candidate may have little chance of achieving their goal. In the 2004 general elections, 95% of House races and 91% of senate races were won by the candidates who spent the most on their campaigns.  Attempts to limit the influence of money on American political campaigns dates back to the 1860s. Recently, Congress passed legislation requiring candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions, how the campaign money is spent, and regulated use of \"soft money\" contributions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/03/02/79356449.pdf |title=Thirty-Ninth Congress. \u2013 Second Session.

In [[Federalist No. 9|''Federalist Papers'' No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. In addition, the first [[president of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or during his tenure as president. Washington hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation.<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. [[Federalist Party|Hamilton]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Madison]] ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system.\n\nIn modern times, in partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot.  Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{main|Political parties in the United States}}\n\nThe modern political party system in the United States is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] since 1856. The Democratic Party positions itself on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]] in American politics; its philosophy of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] advocates [[Social equality|social]] and [[Equity (economics)|economic equality]], along with the [[welfare state]]. The Republican Party positions itself on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the spectrum and supports a [[Conservatism in the United States|modern American conservative]] platform with [[Fiscal conservatism|reduced government spending]] on domestic affairs, [[Opposition to immigration#United States|restrictions on immigration]], and [[Social conservatism in the United States|laws enforcing traditional social values]]. The Democratic core base consists of [[List of United States cities by population|people living in urban areas]], [[Millennials|young people]], and [[Discrimination in the United States|historically marginalized groups]] such as [[Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States|racial minorities]]. The Republican core base consists of people in [[Rural areas in the United States|rural areas]], [[Old people|the elderly]], [[White Americans|white people]], and [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelicals Christians]].\n\n[[Third party (United States)|Third parties]] and [[independent voters]] have achieved relatively minor representation from time to time at local levels. The [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] is the largest third party in the country, claiming more than 250,000 registered voters in 2013;<ref name=\"lpfaq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lp.org/faq |title=Frequently asked questions about the Libertarian Party |publisher=Libertarian National Committee |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> it generally positions itself as [[centrism|centrist]] or [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] and supports a [[classical liberal]] position. Other contemporary third parties include the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]], supporting [[Green politics]], and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], supporting [[paleoconservatism]].\n\n===Elections===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{details|Elections in the United States}}\nUnlike in some [[parliamentary system]]s, Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. With a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. On a national level, the [[President of the United States|president]] is elected indirectly by the people, through an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In modern times, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the House of Representatives and the Senate, offices at the state and local levels are directly elected. \n\nVarious federal and state laws regulate elections. The [[United States Constitution]] defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] and various [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]]. [[U.S. state|State]] law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.\n\n===Organization of American political parties===<!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] -->\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Political party strength in U.S. states}}\nAmerican political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership, activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus, for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party. In the United States, one can often become a \"member\" of a party, merely by stating that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party. Such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way. It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations within the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party's primary elections. A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day. The sole factor that brings one \"closer to the action\" is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.\n\nParty identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who are seeking the nomination. While many believe that in the end, the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, parties are not required to nominate the candidate with the most votes. In the Democratic Party, there are Super-Delegates (officials elected at the state level, and an equal number of unelected Democratic party officials), whose individual votes can and in some cases do go against the will of voters. For instance, in the 2016 election, despite a strong majority of Democrats voting to nominate Bernie Sanders, nearly every super delegate favored Hillary Clinton, hence she was the Democratic Party nominee for 2016, eventually losing in the General election to Donald Trump.\n\nThe result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent. An elected official once in office may also act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this had led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\").\n\nAt the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Republican National Committee]]) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party.\n\nBoth parties also have separate campaign committees that work to elect candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the [[Hill committee]]s, which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress.\n\nState parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state level.\n\nDespite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties. In what is known as \"[[Coattail effect|presidential coattails]]\", candidates in presidential elections become the ''de facto'' leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. On the other hand, federal [[midterm election]]s (where only Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president's agenda, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/07/AR2006110701697.html |title=A Voter Rebuke For Bush, the War And the Right |newspaper=Washington Post |date=November 8, 2006 |quote=Bush and senior adviser Karl Rove tried to replicate that strategy this fall, hoping to keep the election from becoming a referendum on the president's leadership. |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Jim |last2=VandeHei |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/04/impeachment/ |title=Election '98 Lewinsky factor never materialized |publisher=CNN |date=November 4, 1998 |quote=Americans shunned the opportunity to turn Tuesday's midterm elections into a referendum on President Bill Clinton's behavior, dashing Republican hopes of gaining seats in the House and Senate.}}</ref>\n\n===General developments===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{See also|History of the United States Republican Party|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nMost of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] rejected political parties as divisive and disruptive. By the 1790s, however, most joined one of the two new parties, and by the 1830s parties had become accepted as central to the democracy.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref>  By the 1790s, the [[First Party System]] was born. Men who held opposing views strengthened their cause by identifying and organizing men of like mind. The followers of [[Alexander Hamilton]], were called \"[[Federalist Party|Federalists]]\"; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of national defense, commerce and industry. The followers of [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Jeffersonians took up the name \"[[Democratic-Republican Party|Republicans]]\"; they preferred a decentralized [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] republic in which the federal government had limited power.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ''Political Parties in a New Nation: The American Experience, 1776\u20131809'' (1963)</ref><ref>Gordon S.  Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815'' (2009)</ref>\n\nBy 1828, the First Party System had collapsed. Two new parties emerged from the remnants of the [[Jeffersonian Democracy]], forming the [[Second Party System]] with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], brought to life in opposition to President [[Andrew Jackson]] and his [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|new Democratic Party]]. The forces of  [[Jacksonian Democracy]], based among urban workers, Southern poor whites, and western farmers, dominated the era.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815\u20131848'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2009)</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country's new territories in the West. The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]. Ex-Whigs joined the [[Know Nothing]]s or the newly formed Republican Party. While the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years later, this new party captured the presidency when [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the election of 1860. By then, parties were well established as the country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people's consciousness. Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communities.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminished. Municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics.\n\n===Development of the two-party system in the United States===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Two-party system#Causes|l1=Causes of a two-party system}}\n\nSince the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties, beginning with the Federalist vs. the Democratic-Republicans, then the Whigs vs. the Democrats, and now the Democrats and Republicans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/48/are-the-parties-dying/|title=Are the Parties Dying?|date=2018-03-22|work=Democracy Journal|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Minor or third political parties appear from time to time and tend to advocate for policies dedicated to a specific issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/politics-july-dec04-third_parties|title=Third Parties in the U.S. Political Process|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> At various times the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Farmer-Labor Party]] and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] for a few years had considerable local strength, and then faded away\u2014although in [[Minnesota]], the Farmer\u2013Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which is now officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]]. At present, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] is the most successful third party.

This encourages the [[two-party system]]; see [[Duverger's law]]. In the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive. Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state), staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for elections to the Senate.\n\nAnother critical factor has been [[ballot access]] law. Originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported. Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's ballot into the voting box. In the late nineteenth century, states began to adopt the [[secret ballot|Australian Secret Ballot Method]], and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot. The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the [[first Red Scare]] that hit America after [[World War I]]. State legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated.\n\nAlthough party members will usually \"toe the line\" and support their party's policies, they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition (\"cross the aisle\") when they please.\n\n\"In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties,\" says [[Nelson W. Polsby]], professor of political science, in the book ''New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution''. \"Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system.\"\n\n===Gerrymandering===\n{{main|Gerrymandering in the United States}}\n[[File:TravisCountyDistricts.png|thumb|250px|U.S. congressional districts covering [[Travis County, Texas]] (outlined in red) in 2002, left, and 2004, right.

In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm.  State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties. Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s.

Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for [[collective bargaining]]. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefs.\n\nOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the [[political action committee]] or PAC. These are independent groups, organized around a [[single issue]] or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] or the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions, however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office.\n\n\"The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies,\" says [[Michael Schudson]] in his 1998 book ''The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life''. \"Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion.\"\n\nThe amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow, as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.\n\n=== Examples of Pressure Groups ===\n\n# The American Association of Retired People (AARP) - The American Association of Retired People is the largest interest group in America, with a membership for 38 million people. Founded in 1958, their aims focus on dictating policy that benefits their members who are 50 and over, ranging from financial security, including work and retirement and healthcare, to ensuring democracy works for all. It also focuses on serving as an advocate within the market place. This involves making sure goods and services are affordable and accessible. \u00a0\n# The National Rifle Association (NRA) - The National Rifle Association, founded in 1871, is one of the most prominent pressure groups in America and historically push large donations forward to keep their interests of defending the use of guns within America, and protecting their constitutional right to bear arms. It has approximately 5.5 million members, which reflects in its strength to sway policy away from gun control despite the rising numbers of shootings across the country, especially within schools. \n# The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) - The National Labor Relations Board is an 'independent federal agency', founded in 1935, whose aim is to defend the rights of employees within the private sector campaigning for policies such as higher wages and improved working conditions. The board is made up of five members who are appointed by the President on five-year terms. They are responsible for iconic legislation such as the 1935 Wagner Act. \n# The National Association for the Advancement for Colored People (NAACP) - The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909, is perhaps best known for their impact on the advancement of civil rights during the 20th century. Although their presence is less obvious in American politics today, the group still fight for greater justice of African Americans. They gained recognition from historical figures such as Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X, which allowed them to gain a huge following of all diversities and played a huge part in the Washington March, 1963; and was also chaired by such figures a W. E. B. Du Bois.\n# The National Organization for Women (NOW) - The National Organization for Women, founded in 1966, labels itself as the grass-root arm of the women's movement. Its purpose is to promote feminist ideals, lead societal change, eliminate discrimination and to defend the rights of women and girls in all aspects of economic, political and social life. NOW played a major part in the ratification of the 1991 Civil Rights Act after two years of intense lobbying, and has a membership of over 500,000 people. Since its establishment, it has gone from a beginning of 28 women to a huge diverse membership with support of all creeds and gender.\n\n==Concerns about oligarchy and a diminishing democracy==\nSome views suggest that the political structure of the United States is in many respects an [[oligarchy]], where a small economic elite overwhelmingly determines policy and law.<ref>Sevcik, J.C.

The federal government shares [[sovereignty]] with the [[U.S. state|state]] governments.\n\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch is headed by the president and is formally independent of both the legislature and the judiciary. The [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] serves as a set of advisers to the president. They include the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and heads of the executive departments. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] of Congress, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The judicial branch (or [[judiciary]]), composed of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, exercises judicial power. The judiciary's function is to interpret the [[United States Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's structure is [[Codified constitution|codified]] in the Constitution.\n\nTwo [[political parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], have [[Two-party system|dominated]] American politics since the [[American Civil War]], although several [[List of political parties in the United States|much smaller parties]] also exist. Generally, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is also known as the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] party within the United States, while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is also known as a [[Centre-right politics|center-right]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party.\n\nThere are a few major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed [[democracies]]. These include greater power in the [[upper house]] of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive and the dominance of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other democratically run developed countries; this is because of a combination of stringent historic controls. These controls take shape in the form of [[State law (United States)|state]] and [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal]] laws, informal [[Censorship in the United States|media prohibitions]] and [[First-past-the-post voting|winner-take-all]] elections and include [[ballot access]] issues and [[United States presidential debates|exclusive debate rules]]. There have been five [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote]].\n\n==Political culture==\n{{main|Political culture of the United States}}\nScholars from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] to the present have found a strong continuity in core American political values since the time of the [[American Revolution]] in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Samuel P.

Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p. 281</ref> Reasons for this [[American exceptionalism]] included:\n\n# [[Suffrage]] was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.  While fewer than 20% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. However, only 6% of Americans were entitled to vote at the foundation of the republic. While the roots of democracy were apparent, nevertheless deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.<ref>Richard R. Beeman, \"The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America,\" ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311\u201340</ref> That deference declined sharply with the American Revolution.\n# In each colony, elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments, decided a wide range of public and private business.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi,''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp. 281\u20132</ref> Topics of public concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Americans spent a great deal of time in court, as private lawsuits were very common. Legal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries, with a central role for trained lawyers. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, and the dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s, as attested by the careers of [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], among many others.<ref>[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], ''The Rise of the legal profession in America'' (2 vol. 1965), vol. 1.</ref>\n# The North American colonies were exceptional in the world context because of the growth of representation of different [[Interest group (disambiguation)|interest groups]].  Unlike in Europe, where royal courts, aristocratic families and  established churches exercised control, the American political culture was open to merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and many other identifiable groups.  Over 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts, unlike in the United Kingdom where it was common to have an absentee member of Parliament.\n# Americans became fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.<ref>Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp. 281\u201386</ref>\n\nNone of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power.\n\n===American ideology===\n[[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], along with a form of [[classical liberalism]], remains the dominant ideology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cal Jillson|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIFCXTqMnMQC&pg=PA14|year=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=14|isbn=9781136875083}}</ref> Central documents include the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (1776), [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] (1787), ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' (1788), [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] (1791), and [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] (1863) and the first Civil Rights Act (1865), among others. The political scientist [[Louis Hartz]] articulated this theme in American political culture in ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955). Hartz saw the antebellum South as breaking away from this central ideology in the 1820s as it constructed a fantasy to support hierarchical, feudal society. Others, such as [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] of the libertarian, Alabama-based Mises Institute argue that the secessionists who formed the Confederacy in 1861 retained the values of classical liberalism.<ref>Hartz, Louis.

Government officials are subject to the law just as others are\n* [[Freedom of religion]]: The government can neither support nor suppress religion\n* [[Freedom of speech]]: The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal speech of a citizen; a [[marketplace of ideas]]\n\nIn response to Hartz and others, political scientist Rogers M. Smith argued in ''Civic Ideals'' (1999) that in addition to liberalism and republicanism, United States political culture has historically served to exclude various populations from access to full citizenship. Terming this ideological tradition \"ascriptive inegalitarianism,\" Smith traces its relevance in nativist, sexist, and racist beliefs and practices alongside struggles over citizenship laws from the early colonial period to the [[Progressive Era]], and further political debates in the following century.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Civic Ideals {{!}} Yale University Press|url = http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300078770/civic-ideals|website = yalebooks.com|access-date = February 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the United States' founding, agriculture and small private businesses dominated the economy, and state government left welfare issues to private or local initiative. Laissez-faire ideology was largely abandoned in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, laissez-faire ideology, as explained especially by [[Milton Friedman]], has once more become a powerful force in American politics.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, B.

Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] (1956) from: The Politics of Hope (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).</ref> Because those two positions are instead generally supported by American conservatives, historian [[Leo P. Ribuffo]] noted in 2011, \"what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or [[neoliberalism]].\"<ref>Leo P. Ribuffo, \"20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy\", ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2\u20136, quote on p. 6</ref>\n\nIn American politics, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is commonly known as the dominant [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] national party, while the smaller [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] is known for being closer to the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[anti-capitalist]] [[left-wing]] of modern American politics. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is commonly known as the dominant [[centre-right politics|center-right]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] national party, and the alternative [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] attracts some independent-leaning voters who tend to be more [[social liberal]] on [[social issues]] and [[fiscally conservative]] on [[economic policy]].\n\n===Suffrage===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{main|Voting rights in the United States}}\nThe right of [[suffrage]] is nearly universal for citizens eighteen years of age and older. All states and the [[District of Columbia]] contribute to the electoral vote for president. However, the District, and other U.S. holdings like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]], lack federal representation in Congress. These constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas. Each commonwealth, territory, or district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's suffrage]] became an important issue after the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-65. After the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1870, giving African-American men the right to vote, various women's groups wanted the right to vote as well. Two major interest groups formed. The first group was the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], formed by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], that wanted to work for suffrage on the federal level and to push for more governmental changes, such as the granting of property rights to married women.<ref>Ellen Carol Dubois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'' (1998)</ref> The second group, the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] formed by [[Lucy Stone]], aimed to give women the right to vote.<ref>Andrea Moore Kerr, ''Lucy Stone: speaking out for equality'' (1992) ch 1</ref>  In 1890, the two groups merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). The NAWSA then mobilized to obtain support state-by-state, and by 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified, giving women the right to vote <ref>Paul D. Buchanan, ''American Women's Rights Movement: A Chronology of Events'' (2009) p. 129</ref> although universal suffrage was only realised in 1964 with the 24th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n[[Student activism]] against the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s prompted the passage of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which lowered the [[voting age]] from twenty-one to eighteen, the legal age of the [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft]].\n\n==State government==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|State governments of the United States}}\n[[State governments of the United States|States governments]] have the power to make laws that are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in the [[U.S. Constitution]] for all citizens. These include [[education]], [[family law]], [[contract law]], and most [[crime]]s. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.\n\nLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected [[Governor (United States)|governor]], who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for [[Nebraska]], which has [[Unicameral|unicameral legislature]], all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the [[Senate]] and the lower house called the [[House of Representatives]], the [[House of Delegates (disambiguation)|House of Delegates]], [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.\n\nThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government. However, state constitutions are generally more detailed.\n\n==Local government==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|Urban politics in the United States}}\nThe United States has 89,500 local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts that deal with issues like fire protection.<ref>''Statistical Abstract: 2010'' p. 416.</ref> Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan\u2014local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.<ref>Ann O'M. Bowman and Richard C. Kearney, ''State and Local Government: The Essentials'' (2008) p. 78</ref>\n\nAbout 28% of the people live in cities of 100,000 or more population. City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the [[municipal government]]. The [[United States Constitution]] only provides for [[U.S. state|states]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]] as subdivisions of the country, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has accordingly [[Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh|confirmed]] the [[Dillon's rule|supremacy of state sovereignty over municipalities]]. For most big cities, cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents. Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. However, almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs.  Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.\n\nThere are three general types of city government: the [[Mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council]], the commission, and the [[Council\u2013manager government|council\u2013manager]]. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.\n\n===Mayor-council===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThis is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials, sometimes with the approval of the council. He or she has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city) and often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.\n\n===Commission===\nThis combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected citywide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talgov.com/commission |title=City Commission |publisher=Talgov.com |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Council-manager===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.\n\nThe city manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his or her work.\n\n===County government===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe [[county (United States)|county]] is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always) containing two or more [[township (United States)|townships]] and several villages. New York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county in its own right. On the other hand, [[Arlington County, Virginia]], the United States' smallest county, located just across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed by a unitary county administration. In other cities, both the city and county governments have merged, creating a [[consolidated city\u2013county]] government.\n\nIn most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the [[county seat]], and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a [[sole commissioner]], who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections. In some [[New England]] states, counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land.\n\n===Municipal government===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governments. These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management. In many states of the US, the term ''town'' does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how [[civil township]]s are used in other states.\n\nThe government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council, which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council, board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners. The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer, or there may be an elected mayor. Governmental employees may include a clerk, treasurer, police and fire officers, and health and welfare officers.\n\nOne unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the [[New England]] region of the United States, is the [[town meeting]]. Once a year, sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws for operating the government. As a body, they decide on road construction and repair, construction of public buildings and facilities, tax rates, and the town budget. The town meeting, which has existed for more than three centuries in some places, is often cited as the purest form of [[direct democracy]], in which the governmental power is not delegated, but is exercised directly and regularly by all the people.\n\n==Campaign finance==\n{{main|Campaign finance in the United States}}\nSuccessful participation, especially in federal elections, requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections Brochure |publisher=Fec.gov |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,<ref>{{cite news|last=Mishak |first=Michael |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/28/recession-means-theres-less-money-campaigns/ |title=Recession means there's less money for political campaigns |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |date= September 28, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2008/July/20080710130812mlenuhret0.6269953.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512182516/http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2008/July/20080710130812mlenuhret0.6269953.html|archivedate=May 12, 2009 |title=Internet Revolutionizes Campaign Fundraising |publisher=America.gov |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> as had [[Howard Dean]] with his Internet appeals. Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizations\u2014traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} This dependency on donors is controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted (see [[campaign finance reform]]). Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] or [[Canada]].\n\nFundraising plays a large role in getting a candidate elected to public office. Without money, a candidate may have little chance of achieving their goal. In the 2004 general elections, 95% of House races and 91% of senate races were won by the candidates who spent the most on their campaigns.  Attempts to limit the influence of money on American political campaigns dates back to the 1860s. Recently, Congress passed legislation requiring candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions, how the campaign money is spent, and regulated use of \"soft money\" contributions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/03/02/79356449.pdf |title=Thirty-Ninth Congress. \u2013 Second Session.

In [[Federalist No. 9|''Federalist Papers'' No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. In addition, the first [[president of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or during his tenure as president. Washington hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation.<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. [[Federalist Party|Hamilton]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Madison]] ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system.\n\nIn modern times, in partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot.  Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{main|Political parties in the United States}}\n\nThe modern political party system in the United States is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] since 1856. The Democratic Party positions itself on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]] in American politics; its philosophy of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] advocates [[Social equality|social]] and [[Equity (economics)|economic equality]], along with the [[welfare state]]. The Republican Party positions itself on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the spectrum and supports a [[Conservatism in the United States|modern American conservative]] platform with [[Fiscal conservatism|reduced government spending]] on domestic affairs, [[Opposition to immigration#United States|restrictions on immigration]], and [[Social conservatism in the United States|laws enforcing traditional social values]]. The Democratic core base consists of [[List of United States cities by population|people living in urban areas]], [[Millennials|young people]], and [[Discrimination in the United States|historically marginalized groups]] such as [[Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States|racial minorities]]. The Republican core base consists of people in [[Rural areas in the United States|rural areas]], [[Old people|the elderly]], [[White Americans|white people]], and [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelicals Christians]].\n\n[[Third party (United States)|Third parties]] and [[independent voters]] have achieved relatively minor representation from time to time at local levels. The [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] is the largest third party in the country, claiming more than 250,000 registered voters in 2013;<ref name=\"lpfaq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lp.org/faq |title=Frequently asked questions about the Libertarian Party |publisher=Libertarian National Committee |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> it generally positions itself as [[centrism|centrist]] or [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] and supports a [[classical liberal]] position. Other contemporary third parties include the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]], supporting [[Green politics]], and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], supporting [[paleoconservatism]].\n\n===Elections===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{details|Elections in the United States}}\nUnlike in some [[parliamentary system]]s, Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. With a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. On a national level, the [[President of the United States|president]] is elected indirectly by the people, through an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In modern times, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the House of Representatives and the Senate, offices at the state and local levels are directly elected. \n\nVarious federal and state laws regulate elections. The [[United States Constitution]] defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] and various [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]]. [[U.S. state|State]] law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.\n\n===Organization of American political parties===<!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] -->\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Political party strength in U.S. states}}\nAmerican political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership, activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus, for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party. In the United States, one can often become a \"member\" of a party, merely by stating that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party. Such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way. It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations within the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party's primary elections. A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day. The sole factor that brings one \"closer to the action\" is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.\n\nParty identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who are seeking the nomination. While many believe that in the end, the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, parties are not required to nominate the candidate with the most votes. In the Democratic Party, there are Super-Delegates (officials elected at the state level, and an equal number of unelected Democratic party officials), whose individual votes can and in some cases do go against the will of voters. For instance, in the 2016 election, despite a strong majority of Democrats voting to nominate Bernie Sanders, nearly every super delegate favored Hillary Clinton, hence she was the Democratic Party nominee for 2016, eventually losing in the General election to Donald Trump.\n\nThe result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent. An elected official once in office may also act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this had led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\").\n\nAt the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Republican National Committee]]) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party.\n\nBoth parties also have separate campaign committees that work to elect candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the [[Hill committee]]s, which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress.\n\nState parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state level.\n\nDespite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties. In what is known as \"[[Coattail effect|presidential coattails]]\", candidates in presidential elections become the ''de facto'' leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. On the other hand, federal [[midterm election]]s (where only Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president's agenda, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/07/AR2006110701697.html |title=A Voter Rebuke For Bush, the War And the Right |newspaper=Washington Post |date=November 8, 2006 |quote=Bush and senior adviser Karl Rove tried to replicate that strategy this fall, hoping to keep the election from becoming a referendum on the president's leadership. |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Jim |last2=VandeHei |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/04/impeachment/ |title=Election '98 Lewinsky factor never materialized |publisher=CNN |date=November 4, 1998 |quote=Americans shunned the opportunity to turn Tuesday's midterm elections into a referendum on President Bill Clinton's behavior, dashing Republican hopes of gaining seats in the House and Senate.}}</ref>\n\n===General developments===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{See also|History of the United States Republican Party|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nMost of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] rejected political parties as divisive and disruptive. By the 1790s, however, most joined one of the two new parties, and by the 1830s parties had become accepted as central to the democracy.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref>  By the 1790s, the [[First Party System]] was born. Men who held opposing views strengthened their cause by identifying and organizing men of like mind. The followers of [[Alexander Hamilton]], were called \"[[Federalist Party|Federalists]]\"; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of national defense, commerce and industry. The followers of [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Jeffersonians took up the name \"[[Democratic-Republican Party|Republicans]]\"; they preferred a decentralized [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] republic in which the federal government had limited power.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ''Political Parties in a New Nation: The American Experience, 1776\u20131809'' (1963)</ref><ref>Gordon S.  Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815'' (2009)</ref>\n\nBy 1828, the First Party System had collapsed. Two new parties emerged from the remnants of the [[Jeffersonian Democracy]], forming the [[Second Party System]] with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], brought to life in opposition to President [[Andrew Jackson]] and his [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|new Democratic Party]]. The forces of  [[Jacksonian Democracy]], based among urban workers, Southern poor whites, and western farmers, dominated the era.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815\u20131848'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2009)</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country's new territories in the West. The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]. Ex-Whigs joined the [[Know Nothing]]s or the newly formed Republican Party. While the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years later, this new party captured the presidency when [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the election of 1860. By then, parties were well established as the country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people's consciousness. Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communities.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminished. Municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics.\n\n===Development of the two-party system in the United States===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Two-party system#Causes|l1=Causes of a two-party system}}\n\nSince the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties, beginning with the Federalist vs. the Democratic-Republicans, then the Whigs vs. the Democrats, and now the Democrats and Republicans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/48/are-the-parties-dying/|title=Are the Parties Dying?|date=2018-03-22|work=Democracy Journal|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Minor or third political parties appear from time to time and tend to advocate for policies dedicated to a specific issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/politics-july-dec04-third_parties|title=Third Parties in the U.S. Political Process|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> At various times the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Farmer-Labor Party]] and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] for a few years had considerable local strength, and then faded away\u2014although in [[Minnesota]], the Farmer\u2013Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which is now officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]].

This encourages the [[two-party system]]; see [[Duverger's law]]. In the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive. Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state), staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for elections to the Senate.\n\nAnother critical factor has been [[ballot access]] law. Originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported. Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's ballot into the voting box. In the late nineteenth century, states began to adopt the [[secret ballot|Australian Secret Ballot Method]], and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot. The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the [[first Red Scare]] that hit America after [[World War I]]. State legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated.\n\nAlthough party members will usually \"toe the line\" and support their party's policies, they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition (\"cross the aisle\") when they please.\n\n\"In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties,\" says [[Nelson W. Polsby]], professor of political science, in the book ''New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution''. \"Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system.\"\n\n===Gerrymandering===\n{{main|Gerrymandering in the United States}}\n[[File:TravisCountyDistricts.png|thumb|250px|U.S. congressional districts covering [[Travis County, Texas]] (outlined in red) in 2002, left, and 2004, right.

In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm.  State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties. Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s. The states of Washington,<ref>[[Washington State Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.redistricting.wa.gov |title=Washington State Redistricting Commission |publisher=Redistricting.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> Arizona,<ref>[[Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.azredistricting.org |title=Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission |publisher=Azredistricting.org |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> and California's [[California Proposition 11 (2008)|Proposition 11 (2008)]] and [[California Proposition 20 (2010)|Proposition 20 (2010)]] have created [[standing committee]]s for redistricting following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for [[collective bargaining]]. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefs.\n\nOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the [[political action committee]] or PAC. These are independent groups, organized around a [[single issue]] or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] or the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions, however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office.\n\n\"The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies,\" says [[Michael Schudson]] in his 1998 book ''The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life''. \"Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion.\"\n\nThe amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow, as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.\n\n=== Examples of Pressure Groups ===\n\n# The American Association of Retired People (AARP) - The American Association of Retired People is the largest interest group in America, with a membership for 38 million people. Founded in 1958, their aims focus on dictating policy that benefits their members who are 50 and over, ranging from financial security, including work and retirement and healthcare, to ensuring democracy works for all. It also focuses on serving as an advocate within the market place. This involves making sure goods and services are affordable and accessible. \u00a0\n# The National Rifle Association (NRA) - The National Rifle Association, founded in 1871, is one of the most prominent pressure groups in America and historically push large donations forward to keep their interests of defending the use of guns within America, and protecting their constitutional right to bear arms. It has approximately 5.5 million members, which reflects in its strength to sway policy away from gun control despite the rising numbers of shootings across the country, especially within schools. \n# The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) - The National Labor Relations Board is an 'independent federal agency', founded in 1935, whose aim is to defend the rights of employees within the private sector campaigning for policies such as higher wages and improved working conditions. The board is made up of five members who are appointed by the President on five-year terms. They are responsible for iconic legislation such as the 1935 Wagner Act. \n# The National Association for the Advancement for Colored People (NAACP) - The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909, is perhaps best known for their impact on the advancement of civil rights during the 20th century. Although their presence is less obvious in American politics today, the group still fight for greater justice of African Americans. They gained recognition from historical figures such as Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X, which allowed them to gain a huge following of all diversities and played a huge part in the Washington March, 1963; and was also chaired by such figures a W. E. B. Du Bois.\n# The National Organization for Women (NOW) - The National Organization for Women, founded in 1966, labels itself as the grass-root arm of the women's movement. Its purpose is to promote feminist ideals, lead societal change, eliminate discrimination and to defend the rights of women and girls in all aspects of economic, political and social life. NOW played a major part in the ratification of the 1991 Civil Rights Act after two years of intense lobbying, and has a membership of over 500,000 people. Since its establishment, it has gone from a beginning of 28 women to a huge diverse membership with support of all creeds and gender.\n\n==Concerns about oligarchy and a diminishing democracy==\nSome views suggest that the political structure of the United States is in many respects an [[oligarchy]], where a small economic elite overwhelmingly determines policy and law.<ref>Sevcik, J.C.

He was the eldest son of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and [[Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Alexander was the first king of [[Congress Poland]], reigning from 1815 to 1825, as well as the first Russian [[Grand Duke of Finland]], reigning from 1809 to 1825.\n\nBorn in [[Saint Petersburg]] to [[Grand Duke]] Paul Petrovich, later Paul I, Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered. He ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As prince and during the early years of his reign, Alexander often used liberal rhetoric, but continued [[Russian absolutism|Russia's absolutist]] policies in practice. In the first years of his reign, he initiated some minor social reforms and (in 1803\u201304) major, liberal educational reforms, such as building more universities. Alexander appointed [[Mikhail Speransky]], the son of a village priest, as one of his closest advisors. The [[Collegium (ministry)|Collegia]] was abolished and replaced by the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], which was created to improve legislation. Plans were also made to set up a parliament and sign a constitution.\n\nIn foreign policy, he changed Russia's position relative to France four times between 1804 and 1812 among neutrality, opposition, and alliance. In 1805 he joined Britain in the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against [[Napoleon]], but after suffering massive defeats at the battles of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], he switched sides and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] (1807) and joined Napoleon's [[Continental System]]. He fought [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)|a small-scale naval war against Britain between 1807 and 1812]] as well as [[Finnish War|a short war against Sweden (1808\u201309)]] after Sweden's refusal to join the Continental System. Alexander and Napoleon hardly agreed, especially regarding Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810. Alexander's greatest triumph came in 1812 when [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] proved to be a catastrophic disaster for the French. As part of the winning coalition against Napoleon, he gained territory in Finland and Poland. He formed the [[Holy Alliance]] to suppress revolutionary movements in Europe that he saw as immoral threats to legitimate Christian monarchs. He also helped Austria's [[Klemens von Metternich]] in suppressing all national and liberal movements.\n\nDuring the second half of his reign, Alexander became increasingly arbitrary, reactionary, and fearful of plots against him; as a result he ended many of the reforms he made earlier. He purged schools of foreign teachers, as education became more religiously driven as well as politically conservative.{{sfn|Walker|1992|pages=343\u2013360}} Speransky was replaced as advisor with the strict artillery inspector [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]], who oversaw the creation of [[military settlements]]. Alexander died of [[typhus]] in December 1825 while on a trip to southern Russia. He left no legitimate children, as his two daughters died in childhood. Neither of his brothers wanted to become emperor. After a period of great confusion (that presaged the failed [[Decembrist revolt]] of [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] army officers in the weeks after his death), he was succeeded by his younger brother, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:youngemperoralexander.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, 1800, by [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]]]]\n\nAlexander was born on 23 December 1777 in [[Saint Petersburg]], and he and his younger brother [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine]] were raised by their grandmother, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]].<ref name=\"russianlife\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=255\n |title        = Alexander I\n |accessdate   = 1 January 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110622153639/http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=255\n |archive-date = 22 June 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Some sources<ref>{{harvnb|McGrew|1992|p=184}}{{full|date=February 2020}}</ref> allege that she planned to remove her son (Alexander's father) Paul I from the succession altogether. From the free-thinking atmosphere of the court of Catherine and his Swiss tutor, [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe]], he imbibed the principles of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s gospel of humanity. But from his military governor, [[Nikolay Saltykov]], he imbibed the traditions of Russian autocracy.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} Andrey Afanasyevich Samborsky, whom his grandmother chose for his religious instruction, was an atypical, unbearded [[Orthodox priest]]. Samborsky had long lived in England and taught Alexander (and Constantine) excellent English, very uncommon for potential Russian autocrats at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\nOn 9 October 1793, when Alexander was still 15 years old, he married 14-year-old [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Princess Louise of Baden]], who took the name Elizabeth Alexeievna.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}} His grandmother was the one who presided over his marriage to the young princess.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=353}} Until his grandmother's death, he was constantly walking the line of allegiance between his grandmother and his father. His steward [[Nikolai Saltykov]] helped him navigate the political landscape, engendering dislike for his grandmother and dread in dealing with his father.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\nCatherine had the [[Alexander Palace]] built for the couple. This did nothing to help his relationship with her, as Catherine would go out of her way to amuse them with dancing and parties, which annoyed his wife. Living at the palace also put pressure on him to perform as a husband, though he felt only a brother's love for the Grand Duchess.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|pp=354-356}} He began to sympathize more with his father, as he saw visiting his father's fiefdom at Gatchina as a relief from the ostentatious court of the empress. There, they wore simple Prussian military uniforms, instead of the gaudy clothing popular at the French court they had to wear when visiting Catherine. Even so, visiting the tsarevich did not come without a bit of travail. Paul liked to have his guests perform military drills, which he also pushed upon his sons Alexander and Constantine. He was also prone to fits of temper, and he often went into fits of rage when events did not go his way.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=357}}\n\n==Tsarevich==\nCatherine's death in November 1796, before she could appoint Alexander as her successor, brought his father, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], to the throne. Alexander disliked him as emperor even more than he did his grandmother. He wrote that Russia had become a \"plaything for the insane\" and that \"absolute power disrupts everything\". It is likely that seeing two previous rulers abuse their autocratic powers in such a way pushed him to be one of the more progressive Romanov tsars of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the rest of the country, Paul was widely unpopular. He accused his wife of conspiring to become another Catherine and seize power from him as his mother did from his father. He also suspected Alexander of conspiring against him, despite his son's earlier refusal to Catherine to seize power from Paul.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=384}}\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|270px|[[Russian Empire|Russia]] (violet) and other world empires in 1800]]\n===Ascension===\nAlexander became Emperor of Russia when his father was assassinated 23 March 1801. Alexander, then 23 years old, was in the palace at the moment of the assassination and was announced his accession by General [[Nicholas Zubov]], one of the assassins. Historians still debate Alexander's role in his father's murder. The most common theory is that he was let into the conspirators' secret and was willing to take the throne but insisted that his father should not be killed. Becoming emperor through a crime that cost his father's life would give Alexander a strong sense of remorse and shame.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|loc=ch 3}}\n\nAlexander I succeeded to the throne on 23 March 1801{{sfn|Olivier|2019}} and was crowned in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] on 15 September of that year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by F.Kruger (1837, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of Alexander I by [[Franz Kr\u00fcger]]]]\n\nThe Orthodox Church initially exercised little influence on Alexander's life. The young emperor was determined to reform the inefficient, highly centralised systems of government that Russia relied upon.  While retaining for a time the old ministers, one of the first acts of his reign was to appoint the [[Private Committee]], comprising young and enthusiastic friends of his own\u2014[[Viktor Kochubey]], [[Nikolay Novosiltsev]], [[Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov|Pavel Stroganov]] and [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]\u2014to draw up a plan of domestic reform, which was supposed to result in the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]] in accordance with the teachings of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Palmer|1974|pp=52\u201355}}\n\nIn a few years the liberal [[Mikhail Speransky]] became one of the emperor's closest advisors, and he drew up many plans for elaborate reforms. In the [[Government reform of Alexander I]] the old [[Collegium (ministry)|Collegia]] were abolished and new Ministries were created in their place, led by ministers responsible to the Crown. A Council of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Sovereign dealt with all interdepartmental matters. [[State Council of Imperial Russia|The State Council]] was created to improve the technique of legislation. It was intended to become the Second Chamber of representative legislature. The [[Governing Senate]] was reorganized as the Supreme Court of the Empire. The codification of the laws initiated in 1801 was never carried out during his reign.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|pp=168\u201372}}\n\nAlexander wanted to resolve another crucial issue in Russia, the [[Serfdom in Russia|status of the serfs]], although this was not achieved until 1861 (during the reign of his nephew [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]). His advisors quietly discussed the options at length. Cautiously, he extended the right to own land to most classes of subjects, including [[state-owned peasant]]s, in 1801 and created a new social category of \"[[free agriculturalist]],\" for peasants voluntarily emancipated by their masters, in 1803. The great majority of serfs were not affected.{{sfn|McCaffray|2005|pp=1\u201321}}\n\nWhen Alexander's reign began, there were three universities in Russia, at [[University of Moscow|Moscow]], [[University of Vilna|Vilna]] (Vilnius), and [[University of Dorpat|Dorpat]] (Tartu). These were strengthened, and three others were founded at [[University of St. Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[University of Kharkov|Kharkov]], and [[University of Kazan|Kazan]]. Literary and scientific bodies were established or encouraged, and the reign became noted for the aid lent to the sciences and arts by the Emperor and the wealthy nobility. Alexander later expelled foreign scholars.{{sfn|Flynn|1988|p={{page needed|date=February 2016}} }}\n\nAfter 1815 the [[military settlements]] (farms worked by soldiers and their families under military control) were introduced, with the idea of making the army, or part of it, self-supporting economically and for providing it with recruits.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}}\n\n===Views held by his contemporaries===\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Alexander I of Russia.svg|thumb|150px|Imperial monogram of Alexander I]]\nCalled an autocrat and \"[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} a man of the world and a mystic, Alexander appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] thought him a \"shifty [[Derogatory use of Byzantine|Byzantine]]\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} and called him the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Talma|Talma]] of the North, as ready to play any conspicuous part. To [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] he was a madman to be humoured. [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], writing of him to Lord Liverpool, gives him credit for \"grand qualities\", but adds that he is \"suspicious and undecided\";{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} and to [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] he was a man of estimable character, disposed to do good, and expected to diffuse through the mass of the Russian people \"a sense of their natural rights\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lipscomb|Bergh|Johnston|1903|p={{page needed|date=February 2020}} }}; {{harvnb|''Jefferson to Priestley, Washington, 29 November 1802}}''</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic Wars ===\n\n====Alliances with other powers====\nUpon his accession, Alexander reversed many of the unpopular policies of his father, Paul, denounced the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], and made peace with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] (April 1801). At the same time he opened negotiations with [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the Holy Roman Empire. Soon afterwards at [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] he entered into a close alliance with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], not as he boasted from motives of policy, but in the spirit of true [[chivalry]], out of [[friendship]] for the young King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and his beautiful wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nThe development of this alliance was interrupted by the short-lived peace of October 1801, and for a while it seemed as though [[French Consulate|France]] and Russia might come to an understanding. Carried away by the enthusiasm of La Harpe, who had returned to Russia from Paris, Alexander began openly to proclaim his admiration for French institutions and for the person of Napoleon Bonaparte. Soon, however, came a change. La Harpe, after a new visit to Paris, presented to Alexander his ''Reflections on the True Nature of the Consul for Life'', which, as Alexander said, tore the veil from his eyes and revealed Bonaparte \"as not a true [[Patriotism|patriot]]\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} but only as \"the most famous tyrant the world has produced\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} Later on, La Harpe and his friend Henri Monod lobbied Alexander, who persuaded the other Allied powers opposing Napoleon to recognise Vaudois and Argovian independence, in spite of Bern's attempts to reclaim them as ''subject lands''. Alexander's disillusionment was completed by the execution of the [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9|duc d'Enghien]] on trumped up charges. The Russian court went into mourning for the last member of the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Cond\u00e9]], and diplomatic relations with France were broken off. Alexander was especially alarmed and decided he had to somehow curb Napoleon's power.{{sfn|Esdaile|2009|pp=192\u2013193}}\n\n====Opposition to Napoleon====\nIn opposing Napoleon I, \"the oppressor of Europe and the disturber of the world's peace,\" Alexander in fact already believed himself to be fulfilling a divine mission. In his instructions to Novosiltsov, his special envoy in London, the emperor elaborated the motives of his policy in language that appealed little to the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Yet the document is of great interest, as it formulates for the first time in an official dispatch the ideals of international policy that were to play a conspicuous part in world affairs at the close of the revolutionary epoch.{{efn|It was issued at the end of the 19th century in the Rescript of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the conference of the [[Hague]] ({{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites: Circular of Count Muraviev, 24 August 1898).}} Alexander argued that the outcome of the war was not only to be the liberation of France, but the universal triumph of \"the sacred [[Human rights|rights of humanity]]\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} To attain this it would be necessary \"after having attached the [[nation]]s to their [[government]] by making these incapable of acting save in the greatest interests of their subjects, to fix the relations of the states amongst each other on more precise rules, and such as it is to their interest to respect\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nA general treaty was to become the basis of the relations of the states forming \"the European Confederation\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} While he believed the effort would not attain universal peace, it would be worthwhile if it established clear principles for the prescriptions of the rights of nations.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} The body would assure \"the positive rights of nations\" and \"the privilege of neutrality,\" while asserting the obligation to exhaust all resources of mediation to retain peace, and would form \"a new code of the law of nations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites ''Instructions to M. Novosiltsov'', 11 September 1804. Tatischeff, p. 82</ref>\n\n====1807 loss to French forces====\n[[File:\u0422\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0438\u0442. 1807.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon]], Alexander, [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]], and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in Tilsit, 1807]]\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon, a little deterred by the Russian autocrat's youthful ideology, never gave up hope of detaching him from the coalition. He had no sooner entered [[Vienna]] in triumph than he opened negotiations with Alexander; he resumed them after the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (2 December<!--New Style-->). [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and France, he urged, were \"geographical allies\";{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} there was, and could be, between them no true conflict of interests; together they might rule the world. But Alexander was still determined \"to persist in the system of disinterestedness in respect of all the states of Europe which he had thus far followed\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} and he again allied himself with the Kingdom of Prussia. The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|campaign of Jena]] and the [[battle of Eylau]] followed; and Napoleon, though still intent on the Russian alliance, stirred up Poles, Turks and Persians to break the obstinacy of the Tsar. A party too in Russia itself, headed by the Tsar's brother Constantine Pavlovich, was clamorous for peace; but Alexander, after a vain attempt to form a new coalition, summoned the Russian nation to a holy war against Napoleon as the enemy of the Orthodox faith. The outcome was the [[Battle of Friedland|rout of Friedland]] (13/14 June 1807<!--New Style-->). Napoleon saw his chance and seized it. Instead of making heavy terms, he offered to the chastened autocrat his alliance, and a partnership in his glory.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nThe two Emperors met at [[Tilsit]] on 25 June 1807<!--New Style-->. Napoleon knew well how to appeal to the exuberant imagination of his new-found friend. He would divide with Alexander the Empire of the world; as a first step he would leave him in possession of the [[Danube River|Danubian]] principalities and give him a free hand to deal with Finland; and, afterwards, the Emperors of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]] and [[Western Roman Empire|West]], when the time should be ripe, would drive the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] from Europe and march across Asia to the conquest of [[Indian subcontinent|India]], a realization of which was finally achieved by the [[United Kingdom|British]] a few years later, and would change the course of modern history. Nevertheless, a thought awoke in Alexander's impressionable mind an ambition to which he had hitherto been a stranger. The interests of Europe as a whole were utterly forgotten.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites: Savary to Napoleon, 18 November 1807. Tatischeff, p. 232.</ref>\n\n===Prussia===\nThe brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship, and he refused to retain the [[Danubian principalities]] as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. \"We have made loyal war\", he said, \"we must make a loyal peace\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} It was not long before the first enthusiasm of Tilsit began to wane. The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube, and each accused the other of breach of faith. Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character, and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between them. The meeting took place at [[Erfurt]] in October 1808 and resulted in a treaty that defined the common policy of the two Emperors. But Alexander's relations with Napoleon nonetheless suffered a change. He realised that in Napoleon sentiment never got the better of reason, that as a matter of fact he had never intended his proposed \"grand enterprise\" seriously, and had only used it to preoccupy the mind of the Tsar while he consolidated his own power in [[Central Europe]]. From this moment the French alliance was for Alexander also not a fraternal agreement to rule the world, but an affair of pure policy. He used it initially to remove \"the geographical enemy\" from the gates of Saint Petersburg by [[Finnish War|wresting Finland from Sweden]] (1809), and he hoped further to make the Danube the southern frontier of Russia.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\n===Franco-Russian alliance===\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|250px|Meeting of Napoleon and Alexander I in [[Tilsit]], a 19th-century painting by [[Adolphe Roehn]]]]\n\nEvents were rapidly heading towards the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance. While Alexander assisted Napoleon in the war of 1809, he declared plainly that he would not allow the [[Austrian Empire]] to be crushed out of existence. Napoleon subsequently complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The tsar in turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the Poles. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. \"I don't want anything for myself\", he said to the French ambassador, \"therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of Poland, if it is a question of its restoration\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|pp=557,558}} cites: Coulaincourt to Napoleon, 4th report, 3 August 1809.

Partly to test his sincerity, Napoleon sent an almost peremptory request for the hand of the grand-duchess [[Anna Pavlovna]], the tsar's youngest sister. After some little delay Alexander returned a polite refusal, pleading the princess's tender age and the objection of the dowager empress to the marriage. Napoleon's answer was to refuse to ratify the 4 January convention, and to announce his engagement to the archduchess Marie Louise in such a way as to lead Alexander to suppose that the two marriage treaties had been negotiated simultaneously. From this time on, the relationship between the two emperors gradually became more and more strained.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nAnother personal grievance for Alexander towards Napoleon was the annexation of [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] by France in December 1810, as [[Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg|the Duke of Oldenburg]] (3 January 1754{{snd}}2 July 1823) was the uncle of the tsar. Furthermore, the disastrous impact of the Continental System on Russian trade made it impossible for the emperor to maintain a policy that was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nAlexander kept Russia as neutral as possible in the ongoing French war with Britain. He did however allow trade to continue secretly with Britain and did not enforce the blockade required by the Continental System.{{sfn|Nolan|2002|p=1666}} In 1810 he withdrew Russia from the Continental System and trade between Britain and Russia grew.{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}}\n[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|240px|The [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1812 at its greatest extent]]\nRelations between France and Russia became progressively worse after 1810. By 1811, it became clear that Napoleon was not keeping to his side of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit. He had promised assistance to Russia in its [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)|war against the Ottoman Empire]], but as the campaign went on, France offered no support at all.{{sfn|Nolan|2002|p=1666}}\n\nWith war imminent between France and Russia, Alexander started to prepare the ground diplomatically. In April 1812 Russia and Sweden signed an agreement for mutual defence. A month later Alexander secured his southern flank through the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]], which formally ended the war against Turkey.{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}} His diplomats managed to extract promises from Prussia and Austria that should Napoleon invade Russia, the former would help Napoleon as little as possible and that the latter would give no aid at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMilitarily Mikhail Speransky had managed to improve the standard of the Russian land forces above that before the start of the 1807 campaign. Primarily on the advice of his sister and Count [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]], Alexander did not take operational control as he had done during the 1807 campaign, instead delegating control to his generals, Prince [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Michael Barclay de Tolly]], Prince [[Pyotr Bagration]] and [[Mikhail Kutuzov]].{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}}\n\n===War against Persia===\n{{main|Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Treaty of Gulistan}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0437\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0448\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u044f\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0438.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|Battle of Ganja]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian War]]]]\n\nDespite brief hostilities in the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], eight years of peace passed before a new conflict erupted between the two empires. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801,{{sfn | ''Tedsnet''}} a subject of [[Persia]] for centuries, and the incorporation of the [[Derbent khanate]] as well quickly thereafter, Alexander was determined to increase and maintain Russian influence in the strategically valuable [[Caucasus]] region.{{sfn|Kazemzadeh|2013|p=5}} In 1801, Alexander appointed [[Pavel Tsitsianov]], a die-hard Russian imperialist of [[Georgians|Georgian]] origin, as Russian commander in chief of the Caucasus.

Russia refused, stormed Ganja, and declared war. Following an almost ten-year stalemate centred around what is now Dagestan, east Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Armenia, with neither party being able to gain the clear upper hand, Russia eventually managed to turn the tide. After a series of successful offensives led by General [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]], including a decisive victory in the [[storming of Lankaran]], Persia was forced to sue for peace. On October 1813, the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], negotiated with British mediation and signed at [[G\u00fcl\u00fcstan, Goranboy|Gulistan]], made the Persian Shah [[Fath Ali Shah]] cede all Persian territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and most of its territories in the [[South Caucasus]] to Russia.

Alexander complied and appointed Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] to take over command of the army. On 7 September, the Grand Arm\u00e9e faced the Russian army at a small village called [[Borodino (village), Mozhaysky District, Moscow Oblast|Borodino]], {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip}} west of [[Moscow]]. The [[Battle of Borodino|battle that followed]] was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 soldiers and resulting in 70,000 casualties. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive.

The Russians had evacuated the city, and the city's governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered several strategic points in Moscow to be [[fire of Moscow (1812)|set ablaze]]. The loss of Moscow did not compel Alexander to sue for peace. After staying in the city for a month, Napoleon moved his army out southwest toward [[Kaluga]], where Kutuzov was encamped with the Russian army. The French advance toward Kaluga was checked by the Russian army, and Napoleon was forced to retreat to the areas already devastated by the invasion. In the weeks that followed the {{lang|fr|Grande Arm\u00e9e}} starved and suffered from the onset of the [[Russian Winter]]. Lack of food and fodder for the horses and persistent [[guerilla warfare|attacks]] upon isolated troops from Russian peasants and Cossacks led to great losses.

Austria was generally not happy with Russian Tzar's line: e.g. in 1809, as French ally, Russia attempted to seize Austrian Krakow and was only thwarted by Poniatowski in the head of Polish hulans (who thus managed to seize the town for the Grand Duchy of Warsaw); and above all wished to avert Russian expansion to Balkan, which intention during time became to be understood as common interest of the power balance in Europe, and finally manifested itself as the Crimean War. At the same time Austria wished to avert supposed Russian enmity, which would result, when Austria could be seen as intending to block Russian imperial ambitions; an attitude justified by the mentioned war, when Austria took neutral stance.

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the [[German Campaign (1813)|campaign in Germany]], they were eventually defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a decisive victory. Following the battle, the Pro-French [[Confederation of the Rhine]] collapsed, thereby losing Napoleon's hold on territory east of the [[Rhine River|Rhine]]. Alexander, being the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the theatre and the paramount monarch among the three main Coalition monarchs, ordered all Coalition forces in Germany to cross the Rhine and invade France.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information in the pragraph}}\n\nThe Coalition forces, divided into three groups, [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|entered northeastern France]] in January 1814.

In spite of being heavily outnumbered, Napoleon defeated the divided Coalition forces in the battles at [[Battle of Brienne|Brienne]] and [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re|La Rothi\u00e8re]], but could not stop the Coalition's advance. Austrian emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] and King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] felt demoralized upon hearing about Napoleon's victories since the start of the campaign. They even considered ordering a general retreat. But Alexander was far more determined than ever to victoriously enter Paris whatever the cost, imposing his will upon [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]], and the wavering monarchs.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=313}} On 28 March, Coalition forces advanced towards Paris, and the city surrendered on 31 March.{{sfn|Maude|1911|p=223}} Until this battle it had been nearly 400 years since [[History of Paris#Plague and War|a foreign army had entered Paris]], during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|250px|The Russian Army entering Paris in 1814]]\n\nCamping outside the city on 29 March, the Coalition armies were to assault the city from its northern and eastern sides the next morning on 30 March. The battle started that same morning with intense artillery bombardment from the Coalition positions. Early in the morning the Coalition attack began when the Russians attacked and drove back the French skirmishers near Belleville before being driven back themselves by French cavalry from the city's eastern suburbs. By 7:00&nbsp;a.m. the Russians attacked the [[Young Guard (Napoleon)|Young Guard]] near Romainville in the centre of the French lines and after some time and hard fighting, pushed them back. A few hours later the Prussians, under [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]], attacked north of the city and carried the French position around Aubervilliers, but did not press their attack. The [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] troops seized the positions at Saint-Maur to the southwest, with Austrian troops in support. The Russian forces then assailed the Montmartre Heights in the city's northeast. Control of the heights was severely contested, until the French forces surrendered.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2013|p=255}}{{snf|Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky|1839|pp=347\u2013372}}\n\nAlexander sent an envoy to meet with the French to hasten the surrender. He offered generous terms to the French and although having intended to avenge Moscow,{{sfn|Montefiore|2016|p=313}} he declared himself to be bringing peace to France rather than its destruction. On 31 March [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] gave the key of the city to the tsar. Later that day the Coalition armies triumphantly entered the city with Alexander at the head of the army followed by the King of Prussia and Prince Schwarzenberg. On 2 April, the Senate passed the ''[[Acte de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'Empereur]]'', which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon was in [[Fontainebleau]] when he heard that Paris had surrendered. Outraged, he wanted to march on the capital, but his marshals refused to fight for him and repeatedly urged him to surrender. He abdicated in favour of his son on 4 April, but the Allies rejected this out of hand, forcing Napoleon to abdicate unconditionally on 6 April. The terms of his abdication, which included his exile to the [[Elba|Isle of Elba]], were settled in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] on 11 April. A reluctant Napoleon ratified it two days later, marking the end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\n==Postbellum==\n\n===Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna===\nAlexander tried to calm the unrest of his conscience by correspondence with the leaders of the evangelical revival on the continent, and sought for omens and supernatural guidance in texts and passages of scripture. It was not, however, according to his own account, till he met the [[Barbara von Kr\u00fcdener|Baroness de Kr\u00fcdener]]\u2014a religious adventuress who made the conversion of princes her special mission\u2014at Basel, in the autumn of 1813, that his soul found peace. From this time a mystic pietism became the avowed force of his political, as of his private actions. Madame de Kr\u00fcdener, and her colleague, the evangelist [[Henri-Louis Empaytaz]], became the confidants of the emperor's most secret thoughts; and during the campaign that ended in the occupation of Paris the imperial prayer-meetings were the oracle on whose revelations hung the fate of the world.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nSuch was Alexander's mood when the downfall of Napoleon left him one of the most powerful sovereigns in Europe. With the memory of the [[treaty of Tilsit]] still fresh in men's minds, it was not unnatural that to cynical men of the world like [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] he merely seemed to be disguising \"under the language of evangelical abnegation\" vast and perilous schemes of ambition.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}} The puzzled powers were, in fact, the more inclined to be suspicious in view of other, and seemingly inconsistent, tendencies of the emperor, which yet seemed all to point to a like disquieting conclusion. For Madame de Kr\u00fcdener was not the only influence behind the throne; and, though Alexander had declared war against the Revolution, [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe|La Harpe]] (his erstwhile tutor) was once more at his elbow, and the catchwords of the gospel of humanity were still on his lips. The very proclamations which denounced Napoleon as \"the genius of evil\", denounced him in the name of \"liberty,\" and of \"enlightenment\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}} Conservatives suspected Alexander of a monstrous intrigue by which the eastern autocrat would ally with the Jacobinism of all Europe, aiming at an all-powerful Russia in place of an all-powerful France. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] Alexander's attitude accentuated this distrust. Castlereagh, whose single-minded aim was the restoration of \"a just equilibrium\" in Europe, reproached the Tsar to his face for a \"conscience\" which led him to imperil the concert of the powers by keeping his hold on Poland in violation of his treaty obligation.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=558}} cites Castlereagh to Liverpool, 2 October 1814.

At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with Metternich. From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe. It was, however, no case of sudden conversion. Though alarmed by the revolutionary agitation in Germany, which culminated in the murder of his agent, the dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] (23 March 1819), Alexander approved of Castlereagh's protest against Metternich's policy of \"the governments contracting an alliance against the peoples\", as formulated in the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of July 1819, and deprecated any intervention of Europe to support \"a league of which the sole object is the absurd pretensions of \"absolute power\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=558}} cites: ''Despatch of Lieven'', 30 Nov (12 Dec.), 1819, and ''Russ.

In the seclusion of the little town of [[Troppau]], where in October 1820 the powers met in conference, Metternich found an opportunity for cementing his influence over Alexander, which had been wanting amid the turmoil and feminine intrigues of Vienna and Aix. Here, in confidence begotten of friendly chats over afternoon tea, the disillusioned autocrat confessed his mistake. \"You have nothing to regret,\" he said sadly to the exultant chancellor, \"but I have!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=559}} cites: Metternich ''Mem.''</ref>\n\nThe issue was momentous. In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolised by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolised by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states. On 19 November he signed the [[Troppau Protocol]], which consecrated the principle of intervention and wrecked the harmony of the concert.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}}\n\n=== Revolt of the Greeks ===\n[[File:Kapodistrias2.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], Russia's former foreign minister, was elected as the first head of state of independent [[Greece]].]]\n\nAt the [[Congress of Laibach]], which had been adjourned in the spring of 1821, Alexander received news of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. From this time until his death, Alexander's mind was conflicted between his dreams of a stable confederation of Europe and his traditional mission as leader of the Orthodox crusade against the Ottomans. At first, under the careful advice of Metternich, Alexander chose the former,{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nSiding against the Greek revolt for the sake of stability in the region, Alexander expelled its leader [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] from the Russian Imperial Cavalry, and directed his foreign minister, Ioannis Kapodistrias (known as [[John Capodistria|Giovanni, Count Capo d'Istria]]), himself a Greek, to disavow any Russian sympathy with Ypsilanti; and in 1822, he issued orders to turn back a deputation from the Greek [[Morea]] province to the [[Congress of Verona]] on the road.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nHe made some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] had been excluded from the Holy Alliance under the principle that the affairs of the East were the \"domestic concerns of Russia\" rather than of the concert of Europe; but Alexander now offered to surrender this claim and act \"as the mandatory of Europe,\" as Austria had acted in Naples, but still to march as a Christian liberator into the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nMetternich's opposition to this assertion of Russian power, putting the Austrian-led balance of power above the interests of Christendom, first opened Alexander's eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals. Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, he was once again moved by the aspirations of his people.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Alexander I with wife by anonym after Sant-Auben (after 1807).jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander and Louise of Baden]]\nOn 9 October 1793, Alexander married [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Louise of Baden]], known as Elizabeth Alexeievna after her conversion to the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]].

Towards the end of Alexander's life their reconciliation was completed by the wise charity of the Empress in sympathising deeply with him over the death of his beloved daughter Sophia Naryshkina, the daughter of his mistress [[Maria Naryshkina]],{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}} with whom he had a relationship from 1799 until 1818. In 1809, Alexander I was widely and famously rumoured to have had an affair with the Finnish noblewoman [[Ulla M\u00f6llersv\u00e4rd]] and to have had a child by her, but this is not confirmed.{{sfn|M\u00e4kel\u00e4-Alitalo|2006}}\n\n==Death==\nWith his mental health deteriorating, Alexander grew increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive. Some historians conclude his profile \"coincides precisely with the [[schizophrenic]] prototype: a withdrawn, seclusive, rather shy, [[introvertive]], unaggressive, and somewhat apathetic individual\".{{sfn|Nichols|1982|p=41}}{{sfn|Cox|1987|p=121}}{{sfn|Truscott|1997|p=26}} In the autumn of 1825 the Emperor undertook a voyage to the south of Russia due to the increasing illness of his wife. During his trip he himself caught [[typhus]], from which he died in the southern city of [[Taganrog]] on 19 November (O.S.)/1 December 1825. His two brothers disputed who would become tsar\u2014each wanted the other to do so. His wife died a few months later as the emperor's body was transported to [[Saint Petersburg]] for the funeral. He was interred at the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in Saint Petersburg on 13 March 1826.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|loc=ch 22}} There are many rumours and legends, of which the most often told claimed that he did not die but rather became a Siberian hermit named [[Feodor Kuzmich]].  Historians reject the legends, but popular writers resurrect them often.<ref>See V.A.

He was the eldest son of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and [[Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Alexander was the first king of [[Congress Poland]], reigning from 1815 to 1825, as well as the first Russian [[Grand Duke of Finland]], reigning from 1809 to 1825.\n\nBorn in [[Saint Petersburg]] to [[Grand Duke]] Paul Petrovich, later Paul I, Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered. He ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As prince and during the early years of his reign, Alexander often used liberal rhetoric, but continued [[Russian absolutism|Russia's absolutist]] policies in practice. In the first years of his reign, he initiated some minor social reforms and (in 1803\u201304) major, liberal educational reforms, such as building more universities. Alexander appointed [[Mikhail Speransky]], the son of a village priest, as one of his closest advisors. The [[Collegium (ministry)|Collegia]] was abolished and replaced by the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], which was created to improve legislation. Plans were also made to set up a parliament and sign a constitution.\n\nIn foreign policy, he changed Russia's position relative to France four times between 1804 and 1812 among neutrality, opposition, and alliance. In 1805 he joined Britain in the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against [[Napoleon]], but after suffering massive defeats at the battles of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], he switched sides and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] (1807) and joined Napoleon's [[Continental System]]. He fought [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)|a small-scale naval war against Britain between 1807 and 1812]] as well as [[Finnish War|a short war against Sweden (1808\u201309)]] after Sweden's refusal to join the Continental System. Alexander and Napoleon hardly agreed, especially regarding Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810. Alexander's greatest triumph came in 1812 when [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] proved to be a catastrophic disaster for the French. As part of the winning coalition against Napoleon, he gained territory in Finland and Poland. He formed the [[Holy Alliance]] to suppress revolutionary movements in Europe that he saw as immoral threats to legitimate Christian monarchs. He also helped Austria's [[Klemens von Metternich]] in suppressing all national and liberal movements.\n\nDuring the second half of his reign, Alexander became increasingly arbitrary, reactionary, and fearful of plots against him; as a result he ended many of the reforms he made earlier. He purged schools of foreign teachers, as education became more religiously driven as well as politically conservative.{{sfn|Walker|1992|pages=343\u2013360}} Speransky was replaced as advisor with the strict artillery inspector [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]], who oversaw the creation of [[military settlements]]. Alexander died of [[typhus]] in December 1825 while on a trip to southern Russia. He left no legitimate children, as his two daughters died in childhood. Neither of his brothers wanted to become emperor. After a period of great confusion (that presaged the failed [[Decembrist revolt]] of [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] army officers in the weeks after his death), he was succeeded by his younger brother, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:youngemperoralexander.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, 1800, by [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]]]]\n\nAlexander was born on 23 December 1777 in [[Saint Petersburg]], and he and his younger brother [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine]] were raised by their grandmother, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]].<ref name=\"russianlife\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=255\n |title        = Alexander I\n |accessdate   = 1 January 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110622153639/http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=255\n |archive-date = 22 June 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Some sources<ref>{{harvnb|McGrew|1992|p=184}}{{full|date=February 2020}}</ref> allege that she planned to remove her son (Alexander's father) Paul I from the succession altogether. From the free-thinking atmosphere of the court of Catherine and his Swiss tutor, [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe]], he imbibed the principles of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s gospel of humanity. But from his military governor, [[Nikolay Saltykov]], he imbibed the traditions of Russian autocracy.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} Andrey Afanasyevich Samborsky, whom his grandmother chose for his religious instruction, was an atypical, unbearded [[Orthodox priest]]. Samborsky had long lived in England and taught Alexander (and Constantine) excellent English, very uncommon for potential Russian autocrats at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\nOn 9 October 1793, when Alexander was still 15 years old, he married 14-year-old [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Princess Louise of Baden]], who took the name Elizabeth Alexeievna.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}} His grandmother was the one who presided over his marriage to the young princess.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=353}} Until his grandmother's death, he was constantly walking the line of allegiance between his grandmother and his father. His steward [[Nikolai Saltykov]] helped him navigate the political landscape, engendering dislike for his grandmother and dread in dealing with his father.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\nCatherine had the [[Alexander Palace]] built for the couple. This did nothing to help his relationship with her, as Catherine would go out of her way to amuse them with dancing and parties, which annoyed his wife. Living at the palace also put pressure on him to perform as a husband, though he felt only a brother's love for the Grand Duchess.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|pp=354-356}} He began to sympathize more with his father, as he saw visiting his father's fiefdom at Gatchina as a relief from the ostentatious court of the empress. There, they wore simple Prussian military uniforms, instead of the gaudy clothing popular at the French court they had to wear when visiting Catherine. Even so, visiting the tsarevich did not come without a bit of travail. Paul liked to have his guests perform military drills, which he also pushed upon his sons Alexander and Constantine. He was also prone to fits of temper, and he often went into fits of rage when events did not go his way.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=357}}\n\n==Tsarevich==\nCatherine's death in November 1796, before she could appoint Alexander as her successor, brought his father, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], to the throne. Alexander disliked him as emperor even more than he did his grandmother. He wrote that Russia had become a \"plaything for the insane\" and that \"absolute power disrupts everything\". It is likely that seeing two previous rulers abuse their autocratic powers in such a way pushed him to be one of the more progressive Romanov tsars of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the rest of the country, Paul was widely unpopular. He accused his wife of conspiring to become another Catherine and seize power from him as his mother did from his father. He also suspected Alexander of conspiring against him, despite his son's earlier refusal to Catherine to seize power from Paul.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=384}}\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|270px|[[Russian Empire|Russia]] (violet) and other world empires in 1800]]\n===Ascension===\nAlexander became Emperor of Russia when his father was assassinated 23 March 1801. Alexander, then 23 years old, was in the palace at the moment of the assassination and was announced his accession by General [[Nicholas Zubov]], one of the assassins. Historians still debate Alexander's role in his father's murder. The most common theory is that he was let into the conspirators' secret and was willing to take the throne but insisted that his father should not be killed. Becoming emperor through a crime that cost his father's life would give Alexander a strong sense of remorse and shame.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|loc=ch 3}}\n\nAlexander I succeeded to the throne on 23 March 1801{{sfn|Olivier|2019}} and was crowned in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] on 15 September of that year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by F.Kruger (1837, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of Alexander I by [[Franz Kr\u00fcger]]]]\n\nThe Orthodox Church initially exercised little influence on Alexander's life. The young emperor was determined to reform the inefficient, highly centralised systems of government that Russia relied upon.  While retaining for a time the old ministers, one of the first acts of his reign was to appoint the [[Private Committee]], comprising young and enthusiastic friends of his own\u2014[[Viktor Kochubey]], [[Nikolay Novosiltsev]], [[Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov|Pavel Stroganov]] and [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]\u2014to draw up a plan of domestic reform, which was supposed to result in the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]] in accordance with the teachings of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Palmer|1974|pp=52\u201355}}\n\nIn a few years the liberal [[Mikhail Speransky]] became one of the emperor's closest advisors, and he drew up many plans for elaborate reforms. In the [[Government reform of Alexander I]] the old [[Collegium (ministry)|Collegia]] were abolished and new Ministries were created in their place, led by ministers responsible to the Crown. A Council of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Sovereign dealt with all interdepartmental matters. [[State Council of Imperial Russia|The State Council]] was created to improve the technique of legislation. It was intended to become the Second Chamber of representative legislature. The [[Governing Senate]] was reorganized as the Supreme Court of the Empire. The codification of the laws initiated in 1801 was never carried out during his reign.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|pp=168\u201372}}\n\nAlexander wanted to resolve another crucial issue in Russia, the [[Serfdom in Russia|status of the serfs]], although this was not achieved until 1861 (during the reign of his nephew [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]). His advisors quietly discussed the options at length. Cautiously, he extended the right to own land to most classes of subjects, including [[state-owned peasant]]s, in 1801 and created a new social category of \"[[free agriculturalist]],\" for peasants voluntarily emancipated by their masters, in 1803. The great majority of serfs were not affected.{{sfn|McCaffray|2005|pp=1\u201321}}\n\nWhen Alexander's reign began, there were three universities in Russia, at [[University of Moscow|Moscow]], [[University of Vilna|Vilna]] (Vilnius), and [[University of Dorpat|Dorpat]] (Tartu). These were strengthened, and three others were founded at [[University of St. Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[University of Kharkov|Kharkov]], and [[University of Kazan|Kazan]]. Literary and scientific bodies were established or encouraged, and the reign became noted for the aid lent to the sciences and arts by the Emperor and the wealthy nobility. Alexander later expelled foreign scholars.{{sfn|Flynn|1988|p={{page needed|date=February 2016}} }}\n\nAfter 1815 the [[military settlements]] (farms worked by soldiers and their families under military control) were introduced, with the idea of making the army, or part of it, self-supporting economically and for providing it with recruits.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}}\n\n===Views held by his contemporaries===\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Alexander I of Russia.svg|thumb|150px|Imperial monogram of Alexander I]]\nCalled an autocrat and \"[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} a man of the world and a mystic, Alexander appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament.

To [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] he was a madman to be humoured. [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], writing of him to Lord Liverpool, gives him credit for \"grand qualities\", but adds that he is \"suspicious and undecided\";{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=556}} and to [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] he was a man of estimable character, disposed to do good, and expected to diffuse through the mass of the Russian people \"a sense of their natural rights\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lipscomb|Bergh|Johnston|1903|p={{page needed|date=February 2020}} }}; {{harvnb|''Jefferson to Priestley, Washington, 29 November 1802}}''</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic Wars ===\n\n====Alliances with other powers====\nUpon his accession, Alexander reversed many of the unpopular policies of his father, Paul, denounced the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], and made peace with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] (April 1801). At the same time he opened negotiations with [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the Holy Roman Empire. Soon afterwards at [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] he entered into a close alliance with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], not as he boasted from motives of policy, but in the spirit of true [[chivalry]], out of [[friendship]] for the young King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and his beautiful wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nThe development of this alliance was interrupted by the short-lived peace of October 1801, and for a while it seemed as though [[French Consulate|France]] and Russia might come to an understanding. Carried away by the enthusiasm of La Harpe, who had returned to Russia from Paris, Alexander began openly to proclaim his admiration for French institutions and for the person of Napoleon Bonaparte. Soon, however, came a change. La Harpe, after a new visit to Paris, presented to Alexander his ''Reflections on the True Nature of the Consul for Life'', which, as Alexander said, tore the veil from his eyes and revealed Bonaparte \"as not a true [[Patriotism|patriot]]\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} but only as \"the most famous tyrant the world has produced\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} Later on, La Harpe and his friend Henri Monod lobbied Alexander, who persuaded the other Allied powers opposing Napoleon to recognise Vaudois and Argovian independence, in spite of Bern's attempts to reclaim them as ''subject lands''. Alexander's disillusionment was completed by the execution of the [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9|duc d'Enghien]] on trumped up charges. The Russian court went into mourning for the last member of the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Cond\u00e9]], and diplomatic relations with France were broken off. Alexander was especially alarmed and decided he had to somehow curb Napoleon's power.{{sfn|Esdaile|2009|pp=192\u2013193}}\n\n====Opposition to Napoleon====\nIn opposing Napoleon I, \"the oppressor of Europe and the disturber of the world's peace,\" Alexander in fact already believed himself to be fulfilling a divine mission. In his instructions to Novosiltsov, his special envoy in London, the emperor elaborated the motives of his policy in language that appealed little to the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Yet the document is of great interest, as it formulates for the first time in an official dispatch the ideals of international policy that were to play a conspicuous part in world affairs at the close of the revolutionary epoch.{{efn|It was issued at the end of the 19th century in the Rescript of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the conference of the [[Hague]] ({{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites: Circular of Count Muraviev, 24 August 1898).}} Alexander argued that the outcome of the war was not only to be the liberation of France, but the universal triumph of \"the sacred [[Human rights|rights of humanity]]\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} To attain this it would be necessary \"after having attached the [[nation]]s to their [[government]] by making these incapable of acting save in the greatest interests of their subjects, to fix the relations of the states amongst each other on more precise rules, and such as it is to their interest to respect\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nA general treaty was to become the basis of the relations of the states forming \"the European Confederation\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} While he believed the effort would not attain universal peace, it would be worthwhile if it established clear principles for the prescriptions of the rights of nations.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} The body would assure \"the positive rights of nations\" and \"the privilege of neutrality,\" while asserting the obligation to exhaust all resources of mediation to retain peace, and would form \"a new code of the law of nations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites ''Instructions to M.

He had no sooner entered [[Vienna]] in triumph than he opened negotiations with Alexander; he resumed them after the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (2 December<!--New Style-->). [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and France, he urged, were \"geographical allies\";{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} there was, and could be, between them no true conflict of interests; together they might rule the world. But Alexander was still determined \"to persist in the system of disinterestedness in respect of all the states of Europe which he had thus far followed\",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} and he again allied himself with the Kingdom of Prussia. The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|campaign of Jena]] and the [[battle of Eylau]] followed; and Napoleon, though still intent on the Russian alliance, stirred up Poles, Turks and Persians to break the obstinacy of the Tsar. A party too in Russia itself, headed by the Tsar's brother Constantine Pavlovich, was clamorous for peace; but Alexander, after a vain attempt to form a new coalition, summoned the Russian nation to a holy war against Napoleon as the enemy of the Orthodox faith. The outcome was the [[Battle of Friedland|rout of Friedland]] (13/14 June 1807<!--New Style-->). Napoleon saw his chance and seized it. Instead of making heavy terms, he offered to the chastened autocrat his alliance, and a partnership in his glory.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nThe two Emperors met at [[Tilsit]] on 25 June 1807<!--New Style-->. Napoleon knew well how to appeal to the exuberant imagination of his new-found friend. He would divide with Alexander the Empire of the world; as a first step he would leave him in possession of the [[Danube River|Danubian]] principalities and give him a free hand to deal with Finland; and, afterwards, the Emperors of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]] and [[Western Roman Empire|West]], when the time should be ripe, would drive the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] from Europe and march across Asia to the conquest of [[Indian subcontinent|India]], a realization of which was finally achieved by the [[United Kingdom|British]] a few years later, and would change the course of modern history. Nevertheless, a thought awoke in Alexander's impressionable mind an ambition to which he had hitherto been a stranger. The interests of Europe as a whole were utterly forgotten.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=557}} cites: Savary to Napoleon, 18 November 1807. Tatischeff, p. 232.</ref>\n\n===Prussia===\nThe brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship, and he refused to retain the [[Danubian principalities]] as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. \"We have made loyal war\", he said, \"we must make a loyal peace\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}} It was not long before the first enthusiasm of Tilsit began to wane. The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube, and each accused the other of breach of faith. Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character, and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between them. The meeting took place at [[Erfurt]] in October 1808 and resulted in a treaty that defined the common policy of the two Emperors. But Alexander's relations with Napoleon nonetheless suffered a change. He realised that in Napoleon sentiment never got the better of reason, that as a matter of fact he had never intended his proposed \"grand enterprise\" seriously, and had only used it to preoccupy the mind of the Tsar while he consolidated his own power in [[Central Europe]]. From this moment the French alliance was for Alexander also not a fraternal agreement to rule the world, but an affair of pure policy. He used it initially to remove \"the geographical enemy\" from the gates of Saint Petersburg by [[Finnish War|wresting Finland from Sweden]] (1809), and he hoped further to make the Danube the southern frontier of Russia.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\n===Franco-Russian alliance===\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|250px|Meeting of Napoleon and Alexander I in [[Tilsit]], a 19th-century painting by [[Adolphe Roehn]]]]\n\nEvents were rapidly heading towards the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance. While Alexander assisted Napoleon in the war of 1809, he declared plainly that he would not allow the [[Austrian Empire]] to be crushed out of existence. Napoleon subsequently complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The tsar in turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the Poles. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. \"I don't want anything for myself\", he said to the French ambassador, \"therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of Poland, if it is a question of its restoration\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|pp=557,558}} cites: Coulaincourt to Napoleon, 4th report, 3 August 1809. Tatischeff, p. 496.</ref>{{sfn|Zawadzki|2009|pp=110\u2013124}}\n\nAlexander complained that the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Treaty of Vienna]], which added largely to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], had \"ill requited him for his loyalty\", and he was only mollified for the time being by Napoleon's public declaration that he had no intention of restoring Poland, and by a convention, signed on 4 January 1810, but not ratified, abolishing the Polish name and orders of chivalry.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nBut if Alexander suspected Napoleon's intentions, Napoleon was no less suspicious of Alexander. Partly to test his sincerity, Napoleon sent an almost peremptory request for the hand of the grand-duchess [[Anna Pavlovna]], the tsar's youngest sister. After some little delay Alexander returned a polite refusal, pleading the princess's tender age and the objection of the dowager empress to the marriage. Napoleon's answer was to refuse to ratify the 4 January convention, and to announce his engagement to the archduchess Marie Louise in such a way as to lead Alexander to suppose that the two marriage treaties had been negotiated simultaneously. From this time on, the relationship between the two emperors gradually became more and more strained.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nAnother personal grievance for Alexander towards Napoleon was the annexation of [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] by France in December 1810, as [[Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg|the Duke of Oldenburg]] (3 January 1754{{snd}}2 July 1823) was the uncle of the tsar. Furthermore, the disastrous impact of the Continental System on Russian trade made it impossible for the emperor to maintain a policy that was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nAlexander kept Russia as neutral as possible in the ongoing French war with Britain. He did however allow trade to continue secretly with Britain and did not enforce the blockade required by the Continental System.{{sfn|Nolan|2002|p=1666}} In 1810 he withdrew Russia from the Continental System and trade between Britain and Russia grew.{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}}\n[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|240px|The [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1812 at its greatest extent]]\nRelations between France and Russia became progressively worse after 1810. By 1811, it became clear that Napoleon was not keeping to his side of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit. He had promised assistance to Russia in its [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)|war against the Ottoman Empire]], but as the campaign went on, France offered no support at all.{{sfn|Nolan|2002|p=1666}}\n\nWith war imminent between France and Russia, Alexander started to prepare the ground diplomatically. In April 1812 Russia and Sweden signed an agreement for mutual defence. A month later Alexander secured his southern flank through the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]], which formally ended the war against Turkey.{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}} His diplomats managed to extract promises from Prussia and Austria that should Napoleon invade Russia, the former would help Napoleon as little as possible and that the latter would give no aid at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMilitarily Mikhail Speransky had managed to improve the standard of the Russian land forces above that before the start of the 1807 campaign. Primarily on the advice of his sister and Count [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]], Alexander did not take operational control as he had done during the 1807 campaign, instead delegating control to his generals, Prince [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Michael Barclay de Tolly]], Prince [[Pyotr Bagration]] and [[Mikhail Kutuzov]].{{sfn|Chapman|2001|p=29}}\n\n===War against Persia===\n{{main|Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Treaty of Gulistan}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0437\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0448\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u044f\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0438.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|Battle of Ganja]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian War]]]]\n\nDespite brief hostilities in the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], eight years of peace passed before a new conflict erupted between the two empires. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801,{{sfn | ''Tedsnet''}} a subject of [[Persia]] for centuries, and the incorporation of the [[Derbent khanate]] as well quickly thereafter, Alexander was determined to increase and maintain Russian influence in the strategically valuable [[Caucasus]] region.{{sfn|Kazemzadeh|2013|p=5}} In 1801, Alexander appointed [[Pavel Tsitsianov]], a die-hard Russian imperialist of [[Georgians|Georgian]] origin, as Russian commander in chief of the Caucasus.

Russia refused, stormed Ganja, and declared war. Following an almost ten-year stalemate centred around what is now Dagestan, east Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Armenia, with neither party being able to gain the clear upper hand, Russia eventually managed to turn the tide. After a series of successful offensives led by General [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]], including a decisive victory in the [[storming of Lankaran]], Persia was forced to sue for peace. On October 1813, the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], negotiated with British mediation and signed at [[G\u00fcl\u00fcstan, Goranboy|Gulistan]], made the Persian Shah [[Fath Ali Shah]] cede all Persian territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and most of its territories in the [[South Caucasus]] to Russia.

On 7 September, the Grand Arm\u00e9e faced the Russian army at a small village called [[Borodino (village), Mozhaysky District, Moscow Oblast|Borodino]], {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip}} west of [[Moscow]]. The [[Battle of Borodino|battle that followed]] was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 soldiers and resulting in 70,000 casualties. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive. The Russian army, undefeated in spite of heavy losses, was able to withdraw the following day, leaving the French without the decisive victory Napoleon sought.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information in the paragraph}}\n\n[[File:Crossing the Berezina River, by Peter von Hess.jpg|thumb|300px|The retreat across the [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina]] of the remnants of Napoleon's ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' in November 1812]]\n\nA week later Napoleon entered Moscow, but there was no delegation to meet the Emperor.

When the remnants of the French army eventually [[battle of Berezina|crossed]] the [[Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 soldiers remained; the {{lang|fr|Grand Arm\u00e9e}} had lost some 380,000 men dead and 100,000 captured. Following the crossing of the Berezina, Napoleon left the army and returned to Paris to protect his position as Emperor and to raise more forces to resist the advancing Russians. The campaign ended on 14 December 1812, with the last French troops finally leaving Russian soil.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information in the paragraph}}\n\nThe campaign was a turning point in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Napoleon's reputation was severely shaken, and French [[hegemony]] in Europe was weakened. The {{lang|fr|Grande Arm\u00e9e}}, made up of [[First French Empire|French]] and allied forces, was reduced to a fraction of its initial strength.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} These events triggered a major shift in European politics. France's ally [[Prussia]], soon followed by [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], broke their imposed alliance with Napoleon{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}{{efn|Austrian K.u.K. interests were not identical with Russian imperialism. Austria not only could not afford to switch sides straight away, because she was since 1809 French ally in dynastical sense also \u2013 and this was one of the motives, why Austria joined coalition only after Napoleon refused solution by negotiation. Austria was generally not happy with Russian Tzar's line: e.g. in 1809, as French ally, Russia attempted to seize Austrian Krakow and was only thwarted by Poniatowski in the head of Polish hulans (who thus managed to seize the town for the Grand Duchy of Warsaw); and above all wished to avert Russian expansion to Balkan, which intention during time became to be understood as common interest of the power balance in Europe, and finally manifested itself as the Crimean War. At the same time Austria wished to avert supposed Russian enmity, which would result, when Austria could be seen as intending to block Russian imperial ambitions; an attitude justified by the mentioned war, when Austria took neutral stance. Only then begun Russia understand, Austria is not condescending to further Russian expansion, and further on took this neutrality as hostility, which became one of the causes of World War I.

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the [[German Campaign (1813)|campaign in Germany]], they were eventually defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a decisive victory. Following the battle, the Pro-French [[Confederation of the Rhine]] collapsed, thereby losing Napoleon's hold on territory east of the [[Rhine River|Rhine]]. Alexander, being the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the theatre and the paramount monarch among the three main Coalition monarchs, ordered all Coalition forces in Germany to cross the Rhine and invade France.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information in the pragraph}}\n\nThe Coalition forces, divided into three groups, [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|entered northeastern France]] in January 1814. Facing them in the theatre were the French forces numbering only about 70,000 men. In spite of being heavily outnumbered, Napoleon defeated the divided Coalition forces in the battles at [[Battle of Brienne|Brienne]] and [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re|La Rothi\u00e8re]], but could not stop the Coalition's advance. Austrian emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] and King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] felt demoralized upon hearing about Napoleon's victories since the start of the campaign. They even considered ordering a general retreat. But Alexander was far more determined than ever to victoriously enter Paris whatever the cost, imposing his will upon [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]], and the wavering monarchs.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=313}} On 28 March, Coalition forces advanced towards Paris, and the city surrendered on 31 March.{{sfn|Maude|1911|p=223}} Until this battle it had been nearly 400 years since [[History of Paris#Plague and War|a foreign army had entered Paris]], during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|250px|The Russian Army entering Paris in 1814]]\n\nCamping outside the city on 29 March, the Coalition armies were to assault the city from its northern and eastern sides the next morning on 30 March. The battle started that same morning with intense artillery bombardment from the Coalition positions. Early in the morning the Coalition attack began when the Russians attacked and drove back the French skirmishers near Belleville before being driven back themselves by French cavalry from the city's eastern suburbs. By 7:00&nbsp;a.m. the Russians attacked the [[Young Guard (Napoleon)|Young Guard]] near Romainville in the centre of the French lines and after some time and hard fighting, pushed them back. A few hours later the Prussians, under [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]], attacked north of the city and carried the French position around Aubervilliers, but did not press their attack. The [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] troops seized the positions at Saint-Maur to the southwest, with Austrian troops in support. The Russian forces then assailed the Montmartre Heights in the city's northeast. Control of the heights was severely contested, until the French forces surrendered.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2013|p=255}}{{snf|Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky|1839|pp=347\u2013372}}\n\nAlexander sent an envoy to meet with the French to hasten the surrender. He offered generous terms to the French and although having intended to avenge Moscow,{{sfn|Montefiore|2016|p=313}} he declared himself to be bringing peace to France rather than its destruction. On 31 March [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] gave the key of the city to the tsar. Later that day the Coalition armies triumphantly entered the city with Alexander at the head of the army followed by the King of Prussia and Prince Schwarzenberg. On 2 April, the Senate passed the ''[[Acte de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'Empereur]]'', which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon was in [[Fontainebleau]] when he heard that Paris had surrendered. Outraged, he wanted to march on the capital, but his marshals refused to fight for him and repeatedly urged him to surrender. He abdicated in favour of his son on 4 April, but the Allies rejected this out of hand, forcing Napoleon to abdicate unconditionally on 6 April. The terms of his abdication, which included his exile to the [[Elba|Isle of Elba]], were settled in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] on 11 April. A reluctant Napoleon ratified it two days later, marking the end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=all information since the last citation}}\n\n==Postbellum==\n\n===Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna===\nAlexander tried to calm the unrest of his conscience by correspondence with the leaders of the evangelical revival on the continent, and sought for omens and supernatural guidance in texts and passages of scripture. It was not, however, according to his own account, till he met the [[Barbara von Kr\u00fcdener|Baroness de Kr\u00fcdener]]\u2014a religious adventuress who made the conversion of princes her special mission\u2014at Basel, in the autumn of 1813, that his soul found peace. From this time a mystic pietism became the avowed force of his political, as of his private actions. Madame de Kr\u00fcdener, and her colleague, the evangelist [[Henri-Louis Empaytaz]], became the confidants of the emperor's most secret thoughts; and during the campaign that ended in the occupation of Paris the imperial prayer-meetings were the oracle on whose revelations hung the fate of the world.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}}\n\nSuch was Alexander's mood when the downfall of Napoleon left him one of the most powerful sovereigns in Europe. With the memory of the [[treaty of Tilsit]] still fresh in men's minds, it was not unnatural that to cynical men of the world like [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] he merely seemed to be disguising \"under the language of evangelical abnegation\" vast and perilous schemes of ambition.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}} The puzzled powers were, in fact, the more inclined to be suspicious in view of other, and seemingly inconsistent, tendencies of the emperor, which yet seemed all to point to a like disquieting conclusion. For Madame de Kr\u00fcdener was not the only influence behind the throne; and, though Alexander had declared war against the Revolution, [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe|La Harpe]] (his erstwhile tutor) was once more at his elbow, and the catchwords of the gospel of humanity were still on his lips. The very proclamations which denounced Napoleon as \"the genius of evil\", denounced him in the name of \"liberty,\" and of \"enlightenment\".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=558}} Conservatives suspected Alexander of a monstrous intrigue by which the eastern autocrat would ally with the Jacobinism of all Europe, aiming at an all-powerful Russia in place of an all-powerful France. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] Alexander's attitude accentuated this distrust. Castlereagh, whose single-minded aim was the restoration of \"a just equilibrium\" in Europe, reproached the Tsar to his face for a \"conscience\" which led him to imperil the concert of the powers by keeping his hold on Poland in violation of his treaty obligation.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=558}} cites Castlereagh to Liverpool, 2 October 1814. F.O. Papers. Vienna VII.</ref>\n\n===Liberal political views===\nOnce a supporter of limited liberalism, as seen in his approval of the [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland]] in 1815,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} from the end of the year 1818 Alexander's views began to change. A [[revolution]]ary [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] among the officers of the guard, and a foolish plot to kidnap him on his way to the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]], are said to have shaken his liberal beliefs. At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with Metternich. From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe. It was, however, no case of sudden conversion. Though alarmed by the revolutionary agitation in Germany, which culminated in the murder of his agent, the dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] (23 March 1819), Alexander approved of Castlereagh's protest against Metternich's policy of \"the governments contracting an alliance against the peoples\", as formulated in the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of July 1819, and deprecated any intervention of Europe to support \"a league of which the sole object is the absurd pretensions of \"absolute power\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=558}} cites: ''Despatch of Lieven'', 30 Nov (12 Dec.), 1819, and ''Russ. Circular'' of 27 January 1820.

And the limits of liberty are the principles of order\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|pp=558,559}} cites: ''Aper\u00e7u des id\u00e9es de l'Empereur'', Martens IV. part i. p. 269.</ref>\n\nIt was the apparent triumph of the principles of disorder in the revolutions of [[Naples]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], combined with increasingly disquieting symptoms of discontent in France, Germany, and among his own people, that completed Alexander's conversion. In the seclusion of the little town of [[Troppau]], where in October 1820 the powers met in conference, Metternich found an opportunity for cementing his influence over Alexander, which had been wanting amid the turmoil and feminine intrigues of Vienna and Aix. Here, in confidence begotten of friendly chats over afternoon tea, the disillusioned autocrat confessed his mistake. \"You have nothing to regret,\" he said sadly to the exultant chancellor, \"but I have!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|1911|p=559}} cites: Metternich ''Mem.''</ref>\n\nThe issue was momentous. In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolised by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolised by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states. On 19 November he signed the [[Troppau Protocol]], which consecrated the principle of intervention and wrecked the harmony of the concert.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}}\n\n=== Revolt of the Greeks ===\n[[File:Kapodistrias2.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], Russia's former foreign minister, was elected as the first head of state of independent [[Greece]].]]\n\nAt the [[Congress of Laibach]], which had been adjourned in the spring of 1821, Alexander received news of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. From this time until his death, Alexander's mind was conflicted between his dreams of a stable confederation of Europe and his traditional mission as leader of the Orthodox crusade against the Ottomans. At first, under the careful advice of Metternich, Alexander chose the former,{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nSiding against the Greek revolt for the sake of stability in the region, Alexander expelled its leader [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] from the Russian Imperial Cavalry, and directed his foreign minister, Ioannis Kapodistrias (known as [[John Capodistria|Giovanni, Count Capo d'Istria]]), himself a Greek, to disavow any Russian sympathy with Ypsilanti; and in 1822, he issued orders to turn back a deputation from the Greek [[Morea]] province to the [[Congress of Verona]] on the road.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nHe made some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] had been excluded from the Holy Alliance under the principle that the affairs of the East were the \"domestic concerns of Russia\" rather than of the concert of Europe; but Alexander now offered to surrender this claim and act \"as the mandatory of Europe,\" as Austria had acted in Naples, but still to march as a Christian liberator into the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\nMetternich's opposition to this assertion of Russian power, putting the Austrian-led balance of power above the interests of Christendom, first opened Alexander's eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals. Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, he was once again moved by the aspirations of his people.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=557}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Alexander I with wife by anonym after Sant-Auben (after 1807).jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander and Louise of Baden]]\nOn 9 October 1793, Alexander married [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Louise of Baden]], known as Elizabeth Alexeievna after her conversion to the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. He later told his friend [[Frederick William III]] that the marriage, a political match devised by his grandmother, [[Catherine the Great]], regrettably proved to be a misfortune for him and his spouse.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}} Their two children died young,{{sfn|Palmer|1974|pp=154\u201355}} though their common sorrow drew the spouses closer together. Towards the end of Alexander's life their reconciliation was completed by the wise charity of the Empress in sympathising deeply with him over the death of his beloved daughter Sophia Naryshkina, the daughter of his mistress [[Maria Naryshkina]],{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=559}} with whom he had a relationship from 1799 until 1818. In 1809, Alexander I was widely and famously rumoured to have had an affair with the Finnish noblewoman [[Ulla M\u00f6llersv\u00e4rd]] and to have had a child by her, but this is not confirmed.{{sfn|M\u00e4kel\u00e4-Alitalo|2006}}\n\n==Death==\nWith his mental health deteriorating, Alexander grew increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive. Some historians conclude his profile \"coincides precisely with the [[schizophrenic]] prototype: a withdrawn, seclusive, rather shy, [[introvertive]], unaggressive, and somewhat apathetic individual\".{{sfn|Nichols|1982|p=41}}{{sfn|Cox|1987|p=121}}{{sfn|Truscott|1997|p=26}} In the autumn of 1825 the Emperor undertook a voyage to the south of Russia due to the increasing illness of his wife. During his trip he himself caught [[typhus]], from which he died in the southern city of [[Taganrog]] on 19 November (O.S.)/1 December 1825. His two brothers disputed who would become tsar\u2014each wanted the other to do so. His wife died a few months later as the emperor's body was transported to [[Saint Petersburg]] for the funeral. He was interred at the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in Saint Petersburg on 13 March 1826.{{sfn|Palmer|1974|loc=ch 22}} There are many rumours and legends, of which the most often told claimed that he did not die but rather became a Siberian hermit named [[Feodor Kuzmich]].

His brother William Woodfall later established the ''Daily'', a paper that reported on parliamentary debates.</ref> from 21 January 1769 to 21 January 1772. The signature had been already used, apparently by him, in a letter of 21 November 1768. These and numerous other personal letters were not included in his ''[[1772 Letters of Junius|Letters of Junius]]'' collection, published in 1772.\n\n==Choice of \"Junius\" as a pseudonym==\nThe name may have been chosen because the same author had already signed '''Lucius''' and '''Brutus''', and wished to exhaust the name of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] patriot who led the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy]]. Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Roman poet [[Juvenal]], who was thought also to have had the [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Junius.  Some say that the author of the Junius letters had previously written under numerous other pseudonyms, and that he continued to do so, under different pseudonyms, after the 36-month period (January 1769 \u2013 January 1772) in which the Junius letters were published. He may, for example, have written as '''Philo-Junius''', a character who came to the rescue of Junius when it was clear that the public was misinterpreting his messages. There is weak evidence that he also wrote as '''Veteran''', '''Nemesis''' and other anonymous correspondents published in the ''Public Advertiser''.\n\n==Objectives, goals and achievements==\nThere is a marked distinction between the main [[1772 Letters of Junius|Letters of Junius]], intended for the erudite public, and his miscellaneous letters. The latter deal with a variety of subjects, some of a purely personal nature, such as the alleged injustice of the [[William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington|Viscount Barrington]], the secretary at war, to the officials of his department.\n\nThe Letters of Junius had a definite objective:\n* to inform the public of their historical and constitutional rights and liberties as Englishmen;\n* to highlight where and how the government had infringed upon these rights.\n\nForemost in his sights was the [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] of [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton]], a fellow Whig whom Junius viewed as particularly corrupt. Grafton's administration had been formed in October 1768, when [[William Pitt the Elder]] was compelled by ill health to retire from office, and was a reconstruction of his cabinet of July 1766. Junius fought for the return to power of Pitt, who had recovered and was not on good terms with his successors.\n\nJunius' private correspondence has been preserved, written in his usual disguised handwriting. He communicated with Pitt, with [[George Grenville]], with [[John Wilkes|Wilkes]] (all opponents of the [[Duke of Grafton]]), and also with [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]], printer and part owner of the ''Public Advertiser''.\n\nThe letters are of interest on three grounds:\n* their political significance;\n* their style; and\n* the mystery which long surrounded their authorship.\n\nThe matter of his letters is considered by some to be invective, though close inspection of his writings reveals a principled man ahead of his time, exposing blatant corruption by the only means available (anonymity) in a country struggling with the idea of freedom of speech.\n\nHe began with a general attack on the ministry for their personal [[immorality]]. An ill-judged defence of [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby]], the popular [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]], by Sir [[William Draper (general)|William Draper]] gave Junius an easy victory over a vulnerable opponent with weak arguments. It was in this short tussle that Junius' style and wit first developed a reputation and public audience. Junius then realised the potential he had to influence public opinion.\n\nConfidently, Junius then went on to expose the problems at their cause\u2014the ministries of [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Grafton]], [[Lord North]] (Grafton's cousin) and the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]]. The core of Junius' arguments were the ''arbitrary'' appointments made by Grafton, presumably to stay in favour with the Duke of Bedford and his party (also known as the Bedfordites or [[Bloomsbury Gang]]). Most notable was Col. [[Henry Lawes Luttrell]] (later 2nd Earl Carhampton), whom Grafton appointed MP for Middlesex (instead of the duly elected Wilkes), and [[Richard Rigby]], whom Grafton made [[Paymaster of the Forces]]. Junius ended with an assault on [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Mansfield]], who Junius argued had set dangerous legal precedents regarding press freedom and [[political libel]] from the Wilkes affair.\n\nJunius was highly disappointed not to have influenced [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in his 19 December 1769 letter. He tried to encourage the King to overcome his resentments towards the petty Wilkes and also to relinquish his trust in corrupt officials. Junius was not a radical anti-royal Whig, as many texts suggest, though he did trouble himself with explaining to the public the real constitutional role of the ''[[royal prerogative]]'', and (if engaged correctly) how it benefited the country.\n\nContrary to some opinions, the practical effect of the letters was highly significant\u2014they made Grafton unpopular enough to end his ministry in January 1770. Junius could only have been disappointed by Grafton's replacement, [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]. Junius confessed himself beaten in his private letter to [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]] of 19 January 1773 for not having achieved his goals. Despite this, Junius' letters were noticed and talked about for generations afterwards and spread throughout Europe in many languages. His concepts on democratic elections, freedom of the press, legal history and the constitutional rights of individuals are now common-place. Few in history have influenced so many and sparked an interest in such real concepts of liberty.\n\n==Style==\n\n[[Latin literature]] (such as the satires of [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], and the speeches of [[Cicero]] against [[Verres]] and [[Catiline]]) was not only studied but imitated at that time, and supplied the inspiration for numerous writings. If Junius was doing what others did, he did it better than anybody else, a fact which sufficiently explains his rapid popularity. His superiority lay in his style. Here also he was by no means original, and he was uneven. There are passages in his writings which can be best described in the words which [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] applied to another writer: \"A mere mixture of vinegar and water, at once vapid and sour\". But at his best Junius attains to a high degree of artificial elegance and vigour. He shows the influence of [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], of [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and above all of [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], who appears to have been his favourite author. The imitation is never slavish. Junius adapts, and does not only repeat. No single sentence will show the quality of a style which produces its effect by persistence and repetition, but a typical passage as follows displays at once the method and the spirit. It is taken from Letter XLIX to the duke of Grafton, 22 June 1771:\n<blockquote>\n''\"The profound respect I bear to the gracious prince who governs this country with no less honour to himself than satisfaction to his subjects, and who restores you to your rank under his standard, will save you from a multitude of reproaches. The attention I should have paid to your failings is involuntarily attracted to the hand which rewards them; and though I am not so partial to the royal judgment as to affirm that the favor of a king can remove mountains of infamy, it serves to lessen at least, for undoubtedly it divides, the burden. While I remember how much is due to his sacred character, I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the meanest and the basest fellow in the kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do not think you so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which you have hitherto so happily directed your ambition, as long as there is one man living who thinks you worthy of his confidence, and fit to be trusted with any share in his government.... With any other prince, the shameful desertion of him in the midst of that distress, which you alone had created, in the very crisis of danger, when he fancied he saw the throne already surrounded by men of virtue and abilities, would have outweighed the memory of your former services. But his majesty is full of justice, and understands the doctrine of compensations; he remembers with gratitude how soon you had accommodated your morals to the necessities of his service, how cheerfully you had abandoned the engagements of private friendship, and renounced the most solemn professions to the public. The sacrifice of Lord Chatham was not lost on him. Even the cowardice and perfidy of deserting him may have done you no disservice in his esteem. The instance was painful, but the principle might please.\"''\n</blockquote>\nWhat seems artificial and stilted in this style did not offend the would-be classic taste of the eighteenth century and no longer conceals a venomous hate and scorn that the laboriously arranged words and artfully counterbalanced clauses convey.\n\n==Readership==\nThe pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for the rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] and [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]. Before 1772 there appeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters, made by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection titled ''Junius: Stat nominis umbra'', with a dedication to the English people and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick succession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]]. In 1806 another appeared with notes by [[John Almon]]. The first new edition of real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It contained the correspondence of Junius with [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]], a selection of the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his handwriting, and notes by [[John Mason Good]]. Curiosity as to the mystery of the authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the writings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he secured by concealment. \"The mystery of Junius increases his importance\" is his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated 18 September 1771.\n\nWoodfall felt assured that\n\n<blockquote>''when kings and ministers are forgotten, when the force and direction of personal satire is no longer understood, and when measures are only felt in their remotest consequences; this book will, I believe, be found to contain principles worthy to be transmitted to posterity.''</blockquote>\n\n==Identity of Junius==\n{{main|Identity of Junius}}\nThe identity of Junius is open to question and debate, and may never be finally resolved unless documents are found which establish his identity. Some scholars support the identification of [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=Frearson|title=The Identity of Junius|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=7|issue=2|pages=211\u2013227|year=1984|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1984.tb00089.x}}</ref> The 1st [[Marquess of Lansdowne]] claimed to know the 'Junius secret' a fortnight before his death, but died without revealing what he thought he knew.\n\n==More recent use of Junius==\n\n[[Samuel Saenger]], political editor of the Fischer publishing house's journal [[Neue Rundschau]] from 1908 to 1934, signed several of his articles as 'Junius'. Most of these were political chronicles that presented a critical left-liberal perspective on German politics. Many of these texts were titled 'Aus Junius' Tagebuch' - 'From Junius' Diary'.\n\n[[Rosa Luxemburg]] published the ''Junius Pamphlet'' in Switzerland in April 1916, and it was secretly distributed in Germany. The text, also known as ''The crisis in German Social Democracy'', had been started in prison in February 1915. It was adopted as the founding policy statement of the International Group, better known as the [[Spartacus League]], which became one element of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in January 1919.\n\nThe pseudonym was used as well by the great Italian economist [[Luigi Einaudi]], who expressed his liberal beliefs in two series of letters signed 'Junius': the former published in 1920, the latter in 1944, while he was living as a refugee in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Walter de Gruyter\n| isbn = 978-3-11-011429-4\n| author = Walter Lipgens and Wilfried Loth\n| title = Documents on the history of European integration\n| date = 1 September 1988\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eJa0QAQiKNsC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=Luigi+Einaudi,+junius#v=onepage&q=Luigi%20Einaudi%2C%20junius&f=false}}</ref>\n \n[[Robert Goddard (novelist)|Robert Goddard]]'s 2005 suspense novel ''Sight Unseen'' is set in the present day; however, the identity of Junius is a major theme in the novel.\n\nThe Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' has carried the following legend on its editorial or front page for many years: \"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.

Junius then realised the potential he had to influence public opinion.\n\nConfidently, Junius then went on to expose the problems at their cause\u2014the ministries of [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Grafton]], [[Lord North]] (Grafton's cousin) and the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]]. The core of Junius' arguments were the ''arbitrary'' appointments made by Grafton, presumably to stay in favour with the Duke of Bedford and his party (also known as the Bedfordites or [[Bloomsbury Gang]]). Most notable was Col. [[Henry Lawes Luttrell]] (later 2nd Earl Carhampton), whom Grafton appointed MP for Middlesex (instead of the duly elected Wilkes), and [[Richard Rigby]], whom Grafton made [[Paymaster of the Forces]]. Junius ended with an assault on [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Mansfield]], who Junius argued had set dangerous legal precedents regarding press freedom and [[political libel]] from the Wilkes affair.\n\nJunius was highly disappointed not to have influenced [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in his 19 December 1769 letter. He tried to encourage the King to overcome his resentments towards the petty Wilkes and also to relinquish his trust in corrupt officials. Junius was not a radical anti-royal Whig, as many texts suggest, though he did trouble himself with explaining to the public the real constitutional role of the ''[[royal prerogative]]'', and (if engaged correctly) how it benefited the country.\n\nContrary to some opinions, the practical effect of the letters was highly significant\u2014they made Grafton unpopular enough to end his ministry in January 1770. Junius could only have been disappointed by Grafton's replacement, [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]. Junius confessed himself beaten in his private letter to [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]] of 19 January 1773 for not having achieved his goals. Despite this, Junius' letters were noticed and talked about for generations afterwards and spread throughout Europe in many languages. His concepts on democratic elections, freedom of the press, legal history and the constitutional rights of individuals are now common-place. Few in history have influenced so many and sparked an interest in such real concepts of liberty.\n\n==Style==\n\n[[Latin literature]] (such as the satires of [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], and the speeches of [[Cicero]] against [[Verres]] and [[Catiline]]) was not only studied but imitated at that time, and supplied the inspiration for numerous writings. If Junius was doing what others did, he did it better than anybody else, a fact which sufficiently explains his rapid popularity. His superiority lay in his style. Here also he was by no means original, and he was uneven. There are passages in his writings which can be best described in the words which [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] applied to another writer: \"A mere mixture of vinegar and water, at once vapid and sour\". But at his best Junius attains to a high degree of artificial elegance and vigour. He shows the influence of [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], of [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and above all of [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], who appears to have been his favourite author. The imitation is never slavish. Junius adapts, and does not only repeat. No single sentence will show the quality of a style which produces its effect by persistence and repetition, but a typical passage as follows displays at once the method and the spirit. It is taken from Letter XLIX to the duke of Grafton, 22 June 1771:\n<blockquote>\n''\"The profound respect I bear to the gracious prince who governs this country with no less honour to himself than satisfaction to his subjects, and who restores you to your rank under his standard, will save you from a multitude of reproaches. The attention I should have paid to your failings is involuntarily attracted to the hand which rewards them; and though I am not so partial to the royal judgment as to affirm that the favor of a king can remove mountains of infamy, it serves to lessen at least, for undoubtedly it divides, the burden. While I remember how much is due to his sacred character, I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the meanest and the basest fellow in the kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do not think you so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which you have hitherto so happily directed your ambition, as long as there is one man living who thinks you worthy of his confidence, and fit to be trusted with any share in his government.... With any other prince, the shameful desertion of him in the midst of that distress, which you alone had created, in the very crisis of danger, when he fancied he saw the throne already surrounded by men of virtue and abilities, would have outweighed the memory of your former services. But his majesty is full of justice, and understands the doctrine of compensations; he remembers with gratitude how soon you had accommodated your morals to the necessities of his service, how cheerfully you had abandoned the engagements of private friendship, and renounced the most solemn professions to the public. The sacrifice of Lord Chatham was not lost on him. Even the cowardice and perfidy of deserting him may have done you no disservice in his esteem. The instance was painful, but the principle might please.\"''\n</blockquote>\nWhat seems artificial and stilted in this style did not offend the would-be classic taste of the eighteenth century and no longer conceals a venomous hate and scorn that the laboriously arranged words and artfully counterbalanced clauses convey.\n\n==Readership==\nThe pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for the rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] and [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]. Before 1772 there appeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters, made by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection titled ''Junius: Stat nominis umbra'', with a dedication to the English people and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick succession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]]. In 1806 another appeared with notes by [[John Almon]]. The first new edition of real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It contained the correspondence of Junius with [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]], a selection of the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his handwriting, and notes by [[John Mason Good]]. Curiosity as to the mystery of the authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the writings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he secured by concealment. \"The mystery of Junius increases his importance\" is his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated 18 September 1771.\n\nWoodfall felt assured that\n\n<blockquote>''when kings and ministers are forgotten, when the force and direction of personal satire is no longer understood, and when measures are only felt in their remotest consequences; this book will, I believe, be found to contain principles worthy to be transmitted to posterity.''</blockquote>\n\n==Identity of Junius==\n{{main|Identity of Junius}}\nThe identity of Junius is open to question and debate, and may never be finally resolved unless documents are found which establish his identity. Some scholars support the identification of [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=Frearson|title=The Identity of Junius|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=7|issue=2|pages=211\u2013227|year=1984|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1984.tb00089.x}}</ref> The 1st [[Marquess of Lansdowne]] claimed to know the 'Junius secret' a fortnight before his death, but died without revealing what he thought he knew.\n\n==More recent use of Junius==\n\n[[Samuel Saenger]], political editor of the Fischer publishing house's journal [[Neue Rundschau]] from 1908 to 1934, signed several of his articles as 'Junius'. Most of these were political chronicles that presented a critical left-liberal perspective on German politics. Many of these texts were titled 'Aus Junius' Tagebuch' - 'From Junius' Diary'. \n\n[[Rosa Luxemburg]] published the ''Junius Pamphlet'' in Switzerland in April 1916, and it was secretly distributed in Germany. The text, also known as ''The crisis in German Social Democracy'', had been started in prison in February 1915. It was adopted as the founding policy statement of the International Group, better known as the [[Spartacus League]], which became one element of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in January 1919.\n\nThe pseudonym was used as well by the great Italian economist [[Luigi Einaudi]], who expressed his liberal beliefs in two series of letters signed 'Junius': the former published in 1920, the latter in 1944, while he was living as a refugee in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Walter de Gruyter\n| isbn = 978-3-11-011429-4\n| author = Walter Lipgens and Wilfried Loth\n| title = Documents on the history of European integration\n| date = 1 September 1988\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eJa0QAQiKNsC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=Luigi+Einaudi,+junius#v=onepage&q=Luigi%20Einaudi%2C%20junius&f=false}}</ref>\n \n[[Robert Goddard (novelist)|Robert Goddard]]'s 2005 suspense novel ''Sight Unseen'' is set in the present day; however, the identity of Junius is a major theme in the novel.\n\nThe Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' has carried the following legend on its editorial or front page for many years: \"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. ''Junius''\".\n\nA Boston, Massachusetts, indie-rock band has been performing and recording under the name [[Junius (band)|Junius]] since around 2003.\n\nIn the third season of the HBO series \"True Detective,\" Junius is a central figure to the cover-up and mystery.

[[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] also did well here, winning in [[Rimouski]] and in [[Bellechasse (electoral district)|Bellechasse]] in 1979. [[Brian Mulroney]], a native of this area, was able to sweep this region for the Conservatives in 1984 and 1988, using the strong nationalist sentiment in the area.   That nationalist support transferred to the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], which dominated this region for the better part of two decades; the Liberals only won Montmagny in 1997 and the [[Bonaventure\u2014\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine|Bonaventure]] region in 1993. When the BQ experienced a decline in 2000, the Liberals were able to win in the [[Gasp\u00e9sie\u2014\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine|Gasp\u00e9]], and took [[L\u00e9vis, Quebec|L\u00e9vis]] in a by-election. When the Liberals collapsed in Quebec, the Bloc regained all their lost seats in 2004. One of those seats, however was lost to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] in 2006, and the Tories got another in a 2009.  Hopes of further Bloc gains were dashed in [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011]], as they were cut down to only one seat, with the NDP seizing one seat each from the Bloc and the Tories (the latter on a judicial recount).\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"

Quebec'''.\n\n==Regional Profile==\nUntil 1984, this region of [[Quebec]] was [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] territory. [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] also did well here, winning in [[Rimouski]] and in [[Bellechasse (electoral district)|Bellechasse]] in 1979. [[Brian Mulroney]], a native of this area, was able to sweep this region for the Conservatives in 1984 and 1988, using the strong nationalist sentiment in the area.   That nationalist support transferred to the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], which dominated this region for the better part of two decades; the Liberals only won Montmagny in 1997 and the [[Bonaventure\u2014\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine|Bonaventure]] region in 1993. When the BQ experienced a decline in 2000, the Liberals were able to win in the [[Gasp\u00e9sie\u2014\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine|Gasp\u00e9]], and took [[L\u00e9vis, Quebec|L\u00e9vis]] in a by-election. When the Liberals collapsed in Quebec, the Bloc regained all their lost seats in 2004. One of those seats, however was lost to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] in 2006, and the Tories got another in a 2009.  Hopes of further Bloc gains were dashed in [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011]], as they were cut down to only one seat, with the NDP seizing one seat each from the Bloc and the Tories (the latter on a judicial recount).\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"

{"title_page": "Jung Yong-jun", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=July 2017}}\n'''Jung Yong-jun''' (Korean: \uc815\uc6a9\uc900; born in 1981) is a [[South Korea]]n writer.\n\n== Life ==\nJung was born in 1981 in [[Gwangju]]. He graduated from [[Chosun University]] for Russian studies, and then studied creative writing in the same university\u2019s graduate school. He began his literary career with his short story ''Good Night, Oblo'' (\uad7f\ub098\uc787, \uc624\ube14\ub85c), which won the 2009 Hyundai Literature Prize for New Writers.\n\nJung first started writing fiction at 26. He began meeting people who wrote fiction, attended literature classes, and then ultimately entered a graduate school. He has said that he was not sure whether he had talent for writing, but it was the first time he had felt that strange feeling of wanting to continue doing it, and improve on it, as well as be with it.

In the Philippines and Indonesia, it is commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the [[World Vegetable Center]] in [[Taiwan]], a center for vegetable research.\n\nMore generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], northern countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia and various countries of [[Oceania]].\n\nAs of 2010, cultivation in Hawaii, for commercial distribution in the United States, was in its early stages.<ref name=\"ted\">{{cite journal\n | title=Farm and Forestry Production and Marketing Profile for Moringa (revised February 2011)\n | author=Ted Radovich\n | year=2011\n | journal=In: Specialty Crops for Pacific Island Agroforestry\n | editor=C.R. Elevitch\n | url=http://agroforestry.net/scps/Moringa_specialty_crop.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cultivation practice===\n====Soil preparations====\nIn tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, \"it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Propagation====\nMoringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. \nDirect seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].\n\n====Planting====\nFor intensive leaf production, \"the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.\"<ref name=\"amaglo\"/> [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density. In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.\n\nMoringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 m.\n\n==Breeding==\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In Pakistan, varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.<ref name=Rees3>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6\u20137 |pages=544\u2013551}}</ref> \nThe different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\n==Yield and harvest==\n''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.<ref name=ted/> Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.<ref name=ted/> [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]], and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.<ref name=\"pollarding\">{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&lpg=PA394&dq=pollarding%20moringa&pg=PA394#v=onepage&q=pollarding%20moringa&f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G.

Often, the fruits are not produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by year three around 400\u2013500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods.<ref>Booth, F.E.M.; Wickens, G.E., 1988: Non-timber Uses of Selected Arid Zone Trees and Shrubs in Africa, p.98, FAO, Rome \"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/t0044e/T0044e16.htm]\".Retrieved 20-11-2013.</ref> In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year.<ref name=ted/> Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during the summer.

In India, several insect pests are seen, including various caterpillars such as the bark-eating [[caterpillar]], the hairy caterpillar or the green leaf caterpillar. The budworms [[Noctuidae]] are known to cause serious defoliation. Damaging agents can also be [[aphid]]s, stem borers, and fruit flies. In some regions, termites can also cause minor damage. If termites are numerous in soils, insects management costs are not bearable.<ref name=parotta/>\n\nThe moringa tree is a host to ''[[Leveillula taurica]]'', a powdery [[mildew]] which causes damage in papaya crops in south India.

In the Philippines and Indonesia, it is commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the [[World Vegetable Center]] in [[Taiwan]], a center for vegetable research.\n\nMore generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], northern countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia and various countries of [[Oceania]].\n\nAs of 2010, cultivation in Hawaii, for commercial distribution in the United States, was in its early stages.<ref name=\"ted\">{{cite journal\n | title=Farm and Forestry Production and Marketing Profile for Moringa (revised February 2011)\n | author=Ted Radovich\n | year=2011\n | journal=In: Specialty Crops for Pacific Island Agroforestry\n | editor=C.R. Elevitch\n | url=http://agroforestry.net/scps/Moringa_specialty_crop.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cultivation practice===\n====Soil preparations====\nIn tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, \"it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Propagation====\nMoringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. \nDirect seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].\n\n====Planting====\nFor intensive leaf production, \"the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.\"<ref name=\"amaglo\"/> [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density. In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.\n\nMoringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 m.\n\n==Breeding==\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In Pakistan, varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.<ref name=Rees3>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6\u20137 |pages=544\u2013551}}</ref> \nThe different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\n==Yield and harvest==\n''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.<ref name=ted/> Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.<ref name=ted/> [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]], and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.<ref name=\"pollarding\">{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&lpg=PA394&dq=pollarding%20moringa&pg=PA394#v=onepage&q=pollarding%20moringa&f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G.
