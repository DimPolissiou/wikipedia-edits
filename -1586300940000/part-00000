The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but in at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but in at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, [[ductility]], or machinability.\n\nThe archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the [[Bronze Age]]. The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western [[Eurasia]] is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC, and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China;<ref>Robert L.

Also, [[Arsenic poisoning|unlike arsenic]], metallic tin and fumes from tin refining are [[Tin poisoning|not toxic]].

[[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]] had a major influence on the development of cultures. In [[Europe]], a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].\n\nIn many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status. In [[Europe]], large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.\n\n===Transition to iron===\nThough bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60\u2013258 vs. 30\u201380,<ref>''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22</ref> the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]] after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200\u20131100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices.<ref>Clayton E.

(1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.</ref> '''Alpha bronze''' consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4\u20135% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s. Historical \"bronzes\" are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver \u2013 between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The [[Benin Bronzes]] are in fact brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] is described as both bronze and brass.\n\nIn the [[Bronze Age]], two forms of bronze were commonly used: \"classic bronze\", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and \"mild bronze\", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.\n\nCommercial bronze (90% copper and 10% zinc) and architectural bronze (57% copper, 3% [[lead]], 40% zinc) are more properly regarded as [[brass]] alloys because they contain [[zinc]] as the main alloying ingredient.

Typically bronze oxidizes only superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is [[Passivation (chemistry)|protected from further corrosion]]. This can be seen on statues from the Hellenistic period. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called \"[[bronze disease]]\" will eventually completely destroy it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226134131/http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 February 2015|title=Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronze is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.\n\nCopper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze that has a high lead content\u2014 6\u20138%), resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and resistance to corrosion by [[seawater]] of several bronze alloys.\n\nThe melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about {{convert|950|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.\n\n==Uses==\nBronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal [[aluminium bronze]].\n\nIt is also widely used for casting [[bronze sculpture]]s. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mould]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].\n\nBronze also has low [[friction]] against dissimilar metals, making it important for [[cannon]]s prior to modern [[Engineering tolerance|tolerancing]], where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.<ref name=\"AlavudeenVenkateshwaran2006\">{{cite book|author1=A.

The reflecting surface was typically made slightly convex so that the whole face could be seen in a small mirror. Bronze was used for this purpose in many parts of the world, probably based on independent discoveries.\n\nBronze mirrors survive from the [[Egypt]]ian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2040\u20131750 BC). In Europe, the [[Etruscans]] were making bronze mirrors in the sixth century BC, and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mirrors followed the same pattern.

These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, [[ductility]], or machinability.\n\nThe archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the [[Bronze Age]]. The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western [[Eurasia]] is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC, and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China;<ref>Robert L.

[[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]] had a major influence on the development of cultures. In [[Europe]], a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].\n\nIn many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status. In [[Europe]], large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is very clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.\n\n===Transition to iron===\nThough bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60\u2013258 vs. 30\u201380,<ref>''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22</ref> the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]] after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200\u20131100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices.<ref>Clayton E.

Alpha bronze alloys of 4\u20135% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s. Historical \"bronzes\" are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver \u2013 between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The [[Benin Bronzes]] are in fact brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] is described as both bronze and brass.\n\nIn the [[Bronze Age]], two forms of bronze were commonly used: \"classic bronze\", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and \"mild bronze\", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets.

Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is [[Passivation (chemistry)|protected from further corrosion]]. This can be seen on statues from the Hellenistic period. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called \"[[bronze disease]]\" will eventually completely destroy it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226134131/http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 February 2015|title=Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronze is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.\n\nCopper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze which has a high lead content\u2014 6\u20138%), resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and resistance to corrosion by [[seawater]] of several bronze alloys.\n\nThe melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about {{convert|950|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.\n\n==Uses==\nBronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal [[aluminium bronze]].\n\nIt is also widely used for casting [[bronze sculpture]]s. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mould]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].\n\nBronze also has very low [[friction]] against dissimilar metals, making it important for [[cannon]]s prior to modern [[Engineering tolerance|tolerancing]], where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.<ref name=\"AlavudeenVenkateshwaran2006\">{{cite book|author1=A.

[[Phosphor bronze]] is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.\n\nUnlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with [[beryllium copper]]) is used to make [[hammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, [[wrench]]es and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors. Bronze is used to make [[bronze wool]] for woodworking applications where [[steel wool]] would discolour [[oak]].\n\n[[Phosphor bronze]] is used for ships' propellers, musical instruments, and electrical contacts.<ref>[http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/phos_bronze.html Resources: Standards & Properties \u2013 Copper & Copper Alloy Microstructures: Phosphor Bronze<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208043816/http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/phos_bronze.html |date=2015-12-08 }}</ref> [[Plain bearing#Bronze|Bearings]] are often made of bronze for its friction properties.

Many of the most famous Greek bronze sculptures are known through Roman copies in marble, which were more likely to survive.\n\nIn India, bronze sculptures from the [[Kushana]] ([[Chausa hoard]]) and [[Gupta]] periods ([[Brahma from Mirpur-Khas]], Akota Hoard, [[Sultanganj Buddha]]) and later periods ([[Hansi]] Hoard) have been found.<ref>Indian bronze masterpieces: the great tradition: specially published for the Festival of India, Asharani Mathur, Sonya Singh, Festival of India, Brijbasi Printers, Dec 1, 1988</ref> Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] used bronze to create intricate statues via the [[lost-wax casting]] method with ornate detailing depicting the deities of [[Hinduism]]. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of [[Swamimalai]] and [[Chennai]].\n\nIn antiquity other cultures also produced works of [[High culture|high art]] using bronze. For example: in Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|bronze heads]] of the [[Benin Empire|Kingdom of Benin]]; in [[Europe]], Grecian bronzes typically of figures from [[Greek mythology]]; in [[east Asia]], [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]]\u2014more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples.
