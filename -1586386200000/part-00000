It was a large, ornate, public building used for meetings and other official business during the Roman Empire. Its ruins have been excavated. What is left from its classical period are mostly foundations, floors, a small back corner wall with a few arches that are part of both the original building and later Imperial reconstructions and a single column from its first building phase.\n\nThe Basilica Julia was built on the site of the earlier [[Basilica Sempronia]] (170 BC) along the south side of the Forum, opposite the [[Basilica Aemilia]]. It was initially dedicated in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], with building costs paid from the spoils of the [[Gallic War]], and was completed by [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], who named the building after his adoptive father. The ruins which have been excavated date to a reconstruction of the Basilica by the Emperor [[Diocletian]], after a fire in 283 AD destroyed the earlier structure.<ref>{{cite article| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/CB-005.html| title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome| author=Samuel Ball Platner & Thomas Ashby| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1929| p=78-80}}</ref>\n\n== History and use ==\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:RomaForoRomanoBasilicaGiulia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The reconstructed remains of a center column with support.

The basilica was built over the remains of two important Republican structures: the [[Basilica Sempronia]], which was demolished by Caesar to make way for the new basilica, and pre-dating both, the house of [[Scipio Africanus]], Rome's legendary general. The Basilica Sempronia was built in 169 BC by [[Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (consul 177 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]] and required the demolition of the house of Africanus and a number of shops to make room.<ref>{{cite book| title=Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide| author=Filippo Coarelli| publisher=University of California Press| year=2014| p=71-73}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Roman Forum: A Reconstruction & Architectural Guide| author=Gilbert Gorski| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2015| p=12, 248}}</ref>\n\nThe first Basilica Julia burned in 9 AD, shortly after completion, but it was reconstructed, enlarged, and rededicated to Augustus' adoptive sons [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]] in 12 AD.<ref name=\"Middleton\">{{cite book| title=The Remains of Ancient Rome| author=John Henry Middleton| year=1892| p=270}}</ref><ref name=\"Platner & Ashby\">{{cite article|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Basilica_Julia.html| title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome| author=Samuel Ball Platner & Thomas Ashby| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1929| p=78-80}}</ref> The Basilica was restored after a fire in 199 AD by [[Septimius Severus]], and later reconstructed by the Emperor [[Diocletian]] after another fire in 283 AD.<ref name=\"Middleton\"/>\n\nThe Basilica is bordered on its short sides by two important ancient roads which led from the Tiber to the Forum: the [[Vicus Jugarius]] to the west, and the [[Vicus Tuscus]] to the east.<ref>{{cite book| title=Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide| author=Filippo Coarelli| publisher=University of California Press| year=2014| p=71}}</ref> The ground floor was divided into five east-west aisles inside, with the central aisle forming a large hall that measured 82x18 meters, sheltered by a three-story high roof.<ref>{{cite book| title=Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide| author=Filippo Coarelli| publisher=University of California Press| year=2014| p=71-73}}</ref> The adjoining aisles to the north and south of the central hall were divided by marble-faced brick columns which supported concrete arcades; the columns in turn supported the upper level of the basilica, which was used as a public gallery.<ref name=\"Platner & Ashby\"/> The floor of the central hall was paved in colorful polychrome marble slabs, contrasting with the plain white marble of the adjoining aisles.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Remains of Ancient Rome| author=John Henry Middleton| year=1892| p=272}}</ref> The Basilica's fa\u00e7ade as it appeared after the Augustan restoration was two stories high and arcaded, with engaged [[Carrara marble]] columns decorating the piers between the arches on both levels.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Remains of Ancient Rome| author=John Henry Middleton| year=1892| p=271}}</ref>\n\nThe Basilica housed the civil law courts and tabernae (shops), and provided space for government offices and banking.

It was a large, ornate, public building used for meetings and other official business during the Roman Empire. Its ruins have been excavated. What is left from its classical period are mostly foundations, floors, a small back corner wall with a few arches that are part of both the original building and later Imperial reconstructions and a single column from its first building phase.\n\nThe Basilica Julia was built on the site of the earlier [[Basilica Sempronia]] (170 BC) along the south side of the Forum, opposite the [[Basilica Aemilia]]. It was initially dedicated in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], with building costs paid from the spoils of the [[Gallic War]], and was completed by [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], who named the building after his adoptive father. The ruins which have been excavated date to a reconstruction of the Basilica by the Emperor [[Diocletian]], after a fire in 283 AD destroyed the earlier structure.<ref>{{cite article| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/CB-005.html| title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome| author=Samuel Ball Platner & Thomas Ashby| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1929| p=78-80}}</ref>\n\n== History and use ==\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:RomaForoRomanoBasilicaGiulia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The reconstructed remains of a center column with support.

The basilica was built over the remains of two important Republican structures: the [[Basilica Sempronia]], which was demolished by Caesar to make way for the new basilica, and pre-dating both, the house of [[Scipio Africanus]], Rome's legendary general.

It was a direct sequel to ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', and continued the theme of combining Universal's three most popular monsters: [[Frankenstein's monster]] ([[Glenn Strange]]), [[Count Dracula]] ([[John Carradine]]), and the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]] ([[Lon Chaney Jr.]]). The film, which was the seventh Universal film to feature Frankenstein's monster, as well as the fourth with Count Dracula and the Wolf Man,<ref name=tcmnotes /> was a commercial success,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but was one of the last [[Universal Monsters|Universal movies]] featuring Frankenstein's monster, vampires, and werewolves, with the exception of the comedy  ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948), in which all three appear.\n\n==Plot==\nCount Dracula (Carradine) arrives at the castle home of Dr. Franz Edelmann ([[Onslow Stevens]]). The Count, who introduces himself as \"Baron Latos\", explains that he has come to Visaria to find a cure for his vampirism. Dr. Edelmann agrees to help. Together with his assistants, Milizia ([[Martha O'Driscoll]]) and the hunchbacked Nina ([[Poni Adams|Jane Adams]]), he has been working on a mysterious plant, the clavaria formosa, whose spores have the ability to reshape bone.  Edelmann explains that he thinks vampirism can be cured by a series of blood transfusions. Dracula agrees to this, and Edelmann uses his own blood for the transfusions. Dracula has his coffin placed in the castle basement.\n\nThat night, Lawrence Talbot (Chaney Jr.) arrives at the castle.  He demands to see Dr. Edelmann about a cure for his lycanthropy. Talbot is asked to wait. Knowing that the moon is rising, Talbot has himself incarcerated by the police. A crowd of curious villagers gathers outside the police station, led by the suspicious Steinmuhl ([[Skelton Knaggs]]). Inspector Holtz ([[Lionel Atwill]]) asks Edelmann to see Talbot, and as the full moon rises, they both witness his transformation into the Wolf Man. Edelmann and Milizia have him transferred to the castle the next morning.  Edelmann tells him that he believes that Talbot's transformations are not triggered by the moonlight, but by pressure on the brain. He believes he can relieve the pressure, but Talbot must wait for him to gather more mold from his spores. Despondent by the thought of becoming the Wolf Man again, Talbot says he wants to kill himself and jumps into the ocean.  He ends up in a cave below the castle.\n\nEdelmann searches for Talbot and finds that he survived the fall, but has turned into the Wolf Man.  The Wolf Man attacks, but suddenly returns to his human form as the moon goes behind the clouds.  In the cave, they find the catatonic Frankenstein\u2019s monster (Strange), still clutching the skeleton of Dr. Niemann. Humidity in the cave is perfect for propagating the clavaria formosa, and a natural tunnel in the cave connects to a basement of the castle. Dr. Edelmann takes the monster back to his lab, but considers it too dangerous to revive him.\n\nDracula tries to seduce Milizia and make her a vampire, but Milizia wards him off with a cross.  Edelmann interrupts to explain that he has found strange antibodies in the Count's blood, requiring another transfusion. Nina begins shadowing Milizia, who is weakened by Dracula's presence; Nina notices that the Count casts no reflection in a mirror. She warns Edelmann of the vampire's danger to Milizia. Edelmann prepares a transfusion that will destroy the vampire. During the procedure, Dracula uses his hypnotic powers to put Edelmann and Nina to sleep; he then reverses the flow of the transfusion, sending his own blood into the doctor's veins. When they awake, Dracula is carrying Milizia away. They revive Talbot and force Dracula away with a cross. Dracula returns to his coffin as the sun is beginning to rise. Edelmann follows him and drags the open coffin into the sunlight, destroying Dracula.\n\nEdelmann begins to react to Dracula's blood, and becomes evil. He no longer casts a reflection in a mirror. Falling unconscious, he sees strange visions of himself performing unspeakable acts. When he awakens, his face has changed to reflect his evil nature just like in his vision, then he returns to his normal self.\n\nEdelmann performs the operation on Talbot.  Afterwards, he transforms again into his evil self and brutally murders his gardener. When the townspeople discover the body, they chase Edelmann, believing him to be Talbot. They follow him to the castle, where Holtz and Steinmuhl interrogate Talbot and Edelmann. Steinmuhl is convinced that Edelmann is the murderer, and assembles a mob to execute him.\n\nTalbot is cured by the operation, but Edelmann again turns into his evil self. He revives Frankenstein\u2019s monster, but the monster is very weak. Nina is horrified by Edelmann's transformation, and Edelmann breaks her neck and tosses her body into the cave. Holtz and Steinmuhl lead the townspeople to the castle. The police attack the monster, but the monster subdues them. Edelmann kills Holtz by accidental electrocution. Talbot shoots Edelmann dead. Talbot traps the monster under fallen shelving. A fire breaks out, and the townspeople flee the burning castle. The burning roof collapses on the monster.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Onslow Stevens]] as Dr. Franz Edelmann\n* [[John Carradine]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Martha O'Driscoll]] as Milizia Morelle\n* [[Poni Adams|Jane \"Poni\" Adams]] as Nina, the hunchback\n* [[Lionel Atwill]] as Police Inspector Holtz\n* [[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]] as Ziegfried\n* [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein\u2019s Monster]]\n* [[Skelton Knaggs]] as Steinmuhl\n* Harry Lamont as Villager (uncredited)\n\n'''<small>Source:<ref name=afi /></small>'''\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n*Lon Chaney Jr. had played the Wolf Man in all three of Universal's previous films about the character, and Glenn Strange had played the Monster once before, in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]''.

It was a direct sequel to ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', and continued the theme of combining Universal's three most popular monsters: [[Frankenstein's monster]] ([[Glenn Strange]]), [[Count Dracula]] ([[John Carradine]]), and the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]] ([[Lon Chaney Jr.]]). The film, which was the seventh Universal film to feature Frankenstein's monster, as well as the fourth with Count Dracula and the Wolf Man,<ref name=tcmnotes /> was a commercial success,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but was one of the last [[Universal Monsters|Universal movies]] featuring Frankenstein's monster, vampires, and werewolves, with the exception of the comedy  ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948), in which all three appear.\n\n==Plot==\nCount Dracula (Carradine) arrives at the castle home of Dr. Franz Edelmann ([[Onslow Stevens]]). The Count, who introduces himself as \"Baron Latos\", explains that he has come to Visaria to find a cure for his vampirism. Dr. Edelmann agrees to help. Together with his assistants, Milizia ([[Martha O'Driscoll]]) and the hunchbacked Nina ([[Poni Adams|Jane Adams]]), he has been working on a mysterious plant, the clavaria formosa, whose spores have the ability to reshape bone.  Edelmann explains that he thinks vampirism can be cured by a series of blood transfusions. Dracula agrees to this, and Edelmann uses his own blood for the transfusions. Dracula has his coffin placed in the castle basement.\n\nThat night, Lawrence Talbot (Chaney Jr.) arrives at the castle.  He demands to see Dr. Edelmann about a cure for his lycanthropy. Talbot is asked to wait. Knowing that the moon is rising, Talbot has himself incarcerated by the police. A crowd of curious villagers gathers outside the police station, led by the suspicious Steinmuhl ([[Skelton Knaggs]]). Inspector Holtz ([[Lionel Atwill]]) asks Edelmann to see Talbot, and as the full moon rises, they both witness his transformation into the Wolf Man. Edelmann and Milizia have him transferred to the castle the next morning.  Edelmann tells him that he believes that Talbot's transformations are not triggered by the moonlight, but by pressure on the brain. He believes he can relieve the pressure, but Talbot must wait for him to gather more mold from his spores. Despondent by the thought of becoming the Wolf Man again, Talbot says he wants to kill himself and jumps into the ocean.  He ends up in a cave below the castle.\n\nEdelmann searches for Talbot and finds that he survived the fall, but has turned into the Wolf Man.  The Wolf Man attacks, but suddenly returns to his human form as the moon goes behind the clouds.  In the cave, they find the catatonic Frankenstein\u2019s monster (Strange), still clutching the skeleton of Dr. Niemann. Humidity in the cave is perfect for propagating the clavaria formosa, and a natural tunnel in the cave connects to a basement of the castle. Dr. Edelmann takes the monster back to his lab, but considers it too dangerous to revive him.\n\nDracula tries to seduce Milizia and make her a vampire, but Milizia wards him off with a cross.  Edelmann interrupts to explain that he has found strange antibodies in the Count's blood, requiring another transfusion. Nina begins shadowing Milizia, who is weakened by Dracula's presence; Nina notices that the Count casts no reflection in a mirror. She warns Edelmann of the vampire's danger to Milizia. Edelmann prepares a transfusion that will destroy the vampire. During the procedure, Dracula uses his hypnotic powers to put Edelmann and Nina to sleep; he then reverses the flow of the transfusion, sending his own blood into the doctor's veins. When they awake, Dracula is carrying Milizia away. They revive Talbot and force Dracula away with a cross. Dracula returns to his coffin as the sun is beginning to rise. Edelmann follows him and drags the open coffin into the sunlight, destroying Dracula.\n\nEdelmann begins to react to Dracula's blood, and becomes evil. He no longer casts a reflection in a mirror. Falling unconscious, he sees strange visions of himself performing unspeakable acts. When he awakens, his face has changed to reflect his evil nature just like in his vision, then he returns to his normal self.\n\nEdelmann performs the operation on Talbot.  Afterwards, he transforms again into his evil self and brutally murders his gardener. When the townspeople discover the body, they chase Edelmann, believing him to be Talbot. They follow him to the castle, where Holtz and Steinmuhl interrogate Talbot and Edelmann. Steinmuhl is convinced that Edelmann is the murderer, and assembles a mob to execute him.\n\nTalbot is cured by the operation, but Edelmann again turns into his evil self. He revives Frankenstein\u2019s monster, but the monster is very weak. Nina is horrified by Edelmann's transformation, and Edelmann breaks her neck and tosses her body into the cave. Holtz and Steinmuhl lead the townspeople to the castle. The police attack the monster, but the monster subdues them. Edelmann kills Holtz by accidental electrocution. Talbot shoots Edelmann dead. Talbot traps the monster under fallen shelving. A fire breaks out, and the townspeople flee the burning castle. The burning roof collapses on the monster.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Onslow Stevens]] as Dr. Franz Edelmann\n* [[John Carradine]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Martha O'Driscoll]] as Milizia Morelle\n* [[Poni Adams|Jane \"Poni\" Adams]] as Nina, the hunchback\n* [[Lionel Atwill]] as Police Inspector Holtz\n* [[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]] as Ziegfried\n* [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein\u2019s Monster]]\n* [[Skelton Knaggs]] as Steinmuhl\n* Harry Lamont as Villager (uncredited)\n\n'''<small>Source:<ref name=afi /></small>'''\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n*Lon Chaney Jr. had played the Wolf Man in all three of Universal's previous films about the character, and Glenn Strange had played the Monster once before, in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]''.

A little over a year after being wounded, Ben took part in the 2009 [[London Marathon#Events|London Marathon]] and raised money for H4H. Despite being in unbearable pain from his prosthetic, Ben completed the marathon in 6 hours and 15 minutes. Since then, he has completed many challenges, including trekking to [[Everest Base Camp]] on the Khumbu Challenge and running the 2010 London Marathon, beating his time from the previous year.\n\n== Awards ==\n\nHelp for Heroes was awarded the '''Support to the Armed Forces''' award during the 2008 [[Sun Military Awards]] \u2013 \"For a civilian, a civil servant, a contractor or just an ordinary member of the public, who has provided invaluable help to the Armed Forces\".\n\n==Criticism==\n\nIn August 2012 a group of wounded ex-servicemen, featured in a report for BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'', criticised Help for Heroes for its relationship to the Ministry of Defence.  The criticism was levelled because of the charity's decision to use funds to subsidise expensive MOD buildings rather than for soldiers' everyday care. The charity has agreed to spend \u00a3153 million on constructing and running five regional MOD Personnel Recovery Centres, primarily for serving military personnel, which discharged servicemen can only use on a case-by-case basis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9464388/Help-for-Heroes-patron-criticises-cosy-MoD-links.html |title=Help for Heroes patron criticises 'cosy' MoD links |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stickler |first=Angus |title=Help for Heroes and MoD criticised by injured troops |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19112550 |publisher=BBC |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> A subsequent investigation by the BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit into the original ''Newsnight'' report upheld the charity's complaint about the programme and concluded that \"there was no evidence to back ''Newsnight'''s claim about Help for Heroes\".<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC apologises for Newsnight Help for Heroes report |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22551914 |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Help for Heroes}}\n*{{Official website|}}\n*{{EW charity|1120920}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Help For Heroes}}\n[[Category:British veterans' organisations]]\n[[Category:Charities based in Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Disability organisations based in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_for_Heroes"}

Stylish for Firefox can additionally style the skin of the browser itself, but the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version does not support this because the user interface is built in native Android code. The styles are applied only to the targets specified. Individual user styles can be enabled or disabled without having to restart the browser.\n\nUser styles are added to the CSS rules provided by the site, but can also override the site's styling (often requiring the <code>!important</code> keyword for each replacement rule). The most common uses are [[ad blocking]], applying a new color scheme, and eliminating unwanted page elements.<ref>\"[http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/61745 Make the whole Web look better with Stylish],\" Nathan Willis, Mon 7 May 2007.</ref>\n\nThere are three classes of user styles. Site styles change the appearance of a particular web site. Global styles change the appearance of all web sites. App styles change the appearance of the Firefox user interface, only supported on Firefox. It is similar to the <code>userChrome.css</code> CSS file used by Firefox and Mozilla-based browsers.\n\n==Privacy issues==\n\nSince January 2017, following the sale of Stylish to Israeli company [[SimilarWeb]], the extension has contained tracking functions that sends information on all visited URLs and HTTP requests, and information contained on search engine results pages, to SimilarWeb servers. In July 2018, after these issues were publicized by a software engineer, Stylish was pulled from both the [[Chrome Web Store]] and [[Mozilla Add-ons]], as well as being automatically uninstalled for all existing users.<ref name=\"ars-stylish-banned\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/|title=\u201cStylish\u201d extension with 2M downloads banned for tracking every site visit|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=2018-07-06|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|accessdate=2018-07-06|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/use-this-popular-chrome-firefox-add-on-google-mozilla-just-banished-it/|title=Use this popular Chrome, Firefox browser add-on?

Henry took [[Winchester College]] as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its statutes and removing its headmaster and some of the scholars to start his new school.\n\nWhen Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land. The group of [[feoffee]]s appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the [[Alien priory|Alien Priories]] for the endowment of Eton were as follows:<ref>Watts, John, ''Henry VI and the Politics of Kingship'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qTP4CF_boeoC&pg=PA169#v=twopage&q&f=false pp. 169\u201370], quoting Calendar of [[Patent Rolls]] 1436\u201341, pp. 454, 471.</ref>\n* [[Henry Chichele|Archbishop Chichele]]\n* Bishop Stafford\n* Bishop Lowe\n* Bishop Ayscough\n* [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk]] (1396\u20131450) (later Duke of Suffolk)\n* [[John Somerset]] (d. 1454), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and the king's doctor\n* [[Thomas Beckington]] (c. 1390\u20131465), Archdeacon of Buckingham, the king's secretary and later [[Lord Privy Seal|Keeper of the Privy Seal]]\n* [[Richard Andrew]] (d. 1477), first Warden of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], later the king's secretary\n* [[Adam Moleyns]] (d. 1450), [[Clerk of the Council]]\n* John Hampton (d. 1472) of Kniver, Staffordshire, an [[Esquire of the Body]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingswinford.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/com/kinver/kinverchurch.htm |title=Kinver Church \u2013 kingswinford.org |publisher= |accessdate=4 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225020702/http://www.kingswinford.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/com/kinver/kinverchurch.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref>\n* James Fiennes, another member of the [[Royal Household]]\n* William Tresham, another member of the Royal Household\n\nIt was intended to have formidable buildings (Henry intended the [[nave]] of the [[Eton College Chapel|College Chapel]] to be the longest in Europe) and several religious [[relic]]s, supposedly including a part of the [[True Cross]] and the [[Crown of Thorns]].<ref name=lrb>{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Charles|title=At Eton|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n05/charles-hope/at-eton|accessdate=28 February 2013 |newspaper=London Review of Books|date=7 March 2013}}</ref> He persuaded the then [[Pope]], [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]], to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant [[indulgence]]s to [[penitent]]s on the [[Feast of the Assumption]]. The college also came into possession of one of England's [[English Apocalypse manuscripts|Apocalypse manuscripts]].\n\nHowever, when Henry was deposed by [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. Legend has it that Edward's mistress, [[Jane Shore]], intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school,<ref>Nevill. p.5.</ref> although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.\n\nConstruction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long,<ref>Nevill, p.5.</ref> with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed. Only the [[choir (architecture)|Quire]] of the intended building was completed. Eton's first Headmaster, [[William Waynflete]], founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of [[Winchester College]],<ref>Nevill, p.4.</ref> built the ante-chapel that completed the chapel. The important wall paintings in the chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, were built between 1441 and 1460.<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, Buildings of England \u2013 Buckinghamshire</ref>\n\nAs the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors. Building resumed when [[Roger Lupton]] was [[Provost (education)|Provost]], around 1517. His name is borne by the big [[gatehouse]] in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.\n\n\"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel\".<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit. p.119.</ref> This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.\n\n=== 19th century onwards ===\nIn the 19th century, the architect [[John Shaw Jr]] (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton. He designed New Buildings (1844\u201346),<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit.</ref> Provost [[Francis Hodgson]]'s addition to providing better accommodation for collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first-floor room where conditions were inhumane.<ref>Extracts from c. 20 of ''A History of Eton College'' by Maxwell Lyte:<br>These rooms contained little besides wooden bedsteads and bureaus. Chairs and tables [were] for the privileged few, and the wind whistled through the gaping casements. Candlesticks were made by folding the cover of a school-book and cutting a hole to receive the candle. A servant was supposed to sweep the rooms, make beds and light fires, but this was all. The lower boys had to fetch water from the pump for [the seniors]. They themselves had neither washstands nor basins...New boys were tossed in blankets until about 1832. In 1834, \"the inmates of a workhouse are better fed than the scholars of Eton ... Boys who could not pay for a private room [in the town] are said to have undergone privations that would be thought inhuman if inflicted on a galley-slave.\"</ref>\n\nFollowing complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the [[Clarendon Commission]] was set up in 1861 as a [[royal commission]] to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.<ref>J.

According to Nevill (citing the historian [[Edward Shepherd Creasy|Sir Edward Creasy]]), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\",<ref>Nevill, p.125.</ref> a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \"the manly character induced by games and sport\" among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's ''C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 la bataille de Waterloo'' (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won\").\n\nAs with other public schools,<ref>The Boy's Own Paper Nov 1915 to September 1919</ref> a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.<ref>Arthur C. Benson, Hugh, Memoirs of a Brother, chapter eight</ref> The project of establishing an \"Eton Mission\" in the crowded district of [[Hackney Wick]] in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and it lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at [[Dorney]]) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by [[G. F. Bodley]] was erected; many Etonians visited and stimulated among other things the [[Eton Manor Boys' Club]], a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the [[59 Club]] for motorcyclists.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13350, England, Rudermannschaft.jpg|thumb|right|Pupils at Eton College dressed as members of various rowing crews taking part in the \"Procession of Boats\" on the River Thames during the \"Fourth of June\" celebrations 1932]]\nThe very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906\u201308 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the [[Boer War]]. Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the [[World War I|Great War]]. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in [[World War II]] and blew out many windows in the Chapel.

This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990, harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased, a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families, and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=de Bellaigue, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher de Bellaigue|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/eton-and-the-making-of-a-modern-elite|title=Eton and the making of a modern elite|magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August\u2013September 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== School terms ==\n<!--[[Half (Eton)]] redirects here-->\nThere are three academic terms<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etoncollege.com/Michaelmas.aspx |title= The Michaelmas Half |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> (known as halves)<ref>McConnell, p.30</ref> in the year:\n* The ''[[Michaelmas]] Half'', from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.\n* The ''[[Lent]] Half'', from mid-January to late March.\n* The ''Summer Half'', from late April to late June or early July.\n\nThey are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.\n\n== Boys' houses ==\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n{{Main|King's Scholar}}\nOne boarding house, ''College'', is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.\n\nKing's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their [[tailcoat]]s, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: ''togati'', wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a [[surplice]] in Chapel. The house is looked after by the [[Master in College]]. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.\n\n=== Oppidans ===\nAs the school grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These students became known as Oppidans, from the [[Latin]] word ''[[oppidum]]'', meaning \"town\".<ref>McConnell, pp.19\u201320</ref> The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a \"dame\", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.\n\nNot all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in \"College\" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are known as [[Oppidan Scholar]]s.<ref>McConnell, p.177</ref> [[Oppidan Scholar|Oppidan scholarships]] may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations. To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OS''.\n\nEach Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (\"beak\"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720),<ref name=autogenerated1>Pevsner op. cit.</ref> Hawtrey House, [[Richard Durnford|Durnford]] House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.\n\n=== House structure ===\n[[File:MK17840 Eton College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front of Eton College]]\nIn addition to the house master, each house has a house captain and a house captain of games. Some houses have more than one. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term, \"Library\", survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as \"Debate\".\n\nThere are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30&nbsp;p.m. These are known as \"Prayers\", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.\n\nFor much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\" or \"Boy, Queue!\", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as [[fagging]], were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThere are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.\n\n== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n{{Main|List of Head Masters of Eton College}}\n\n== Uniform ==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester 4909925573 1cfc8ea5c0 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1914 dress of a junior Eton pupil, wearing a top hat, neck-tie and \"bum-freezer\", none of which are now worn]]\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or [[morning coat]]) and black [[waistcoat]], a starched [[false-collar|stiff collar]] and black pinstriped trousers.

There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see [[Eton College#Prefects|School Prefects]] and [[#King's Scholars|King's Scholars]] sections.\n\nThe long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1820<ref>Nevill, p.33.</ref> is unfounded.

The boys do not wear any particular dress at Eton?\nEdward Balston: No, with the exception that they are obliged to wear a white neckcloth.\n\nLord Clarendon: Is the colour of their clothes much restricted?\n\nEdward Balston: We would not let them wear for instance a yellow coat or any other colour very much out of the way.\n\nLord Clarendon: If they do not adopt anything very extravagant either with respect to colour or cut you allow them to follow their own taste with respect to the choice of their clothes?\n\nEdward Balston: Yes.\n\nLord Lyttelton: They must wear the common round hat?\nEdward Balston: Yes.<ref>(1864).''Report of Her Majesty\u2019s Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Revenues and Management of Certain Colleges and Schools and the Studies Pursued and Instruction Given Therein; with an Appendix and Evidence, Vol. III.

Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology. Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.\n\nVarious benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.\n\n== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a \"Show Up\", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress.<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\">McConnell, p.84</ref> If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be \"Commended for Good Effort\" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).\n\nIf any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\",<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\" /> storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.\n\nThe opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\".<ref>McConnell, pp.82\u201383</ref> This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or [[School punishment#Writing lines|writing lines]]. In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.\n\nInternal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called \"Trials\".<ref>McConnell, pp.85\u201389</ref>\n\nA boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).<ref>McConnell, p.42</ref> Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed \"on the Bill\", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.<ref name=\"McConnell, pp.83-84\">McConnell, pp.83\u201384</ref> The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] (suspension) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the school office.\n\nA traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin [[hexameters]]. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, [[Georgics]] (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6351331.stm |title=Cameron defiant over drug claims |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.\n\n=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], generally known as \"beating\". In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as \"flogging day\".<ref name=\"Nevill, p.9\">Nevill, p.9.</ref> A special wooden birching block was used for the purpose, with the boy being directed to fetch it and then kneel over it.\n\nBeating was phased out in the 1980s.

Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a [[birching]] on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.  [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with [[caning]], also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.<ref>Onyeama, Dillibe (1972). ''Nigger at Eton''. London: Leslie Frewin. p.100. {{ISBN|978-0-85632-003-3}}</ref> Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see [[Eton college#Prefects|Eton Society]] below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.<ref>Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). ''Eton Microcosm''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. {{OCLC|7396426}}</ref>\n\nChenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, [[Michael McCrum]], retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master. By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dixon, Mark |title=An Eton Schoolboy's Album |year=1985 |publisher=Debrett's |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/etonschoolboysal0000dixo/page/95 95] |isbn=978-0-905649-78-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/etonschoolboysal0000dixo/page/95 }}</ref>\n\n== Prefects ==\nIn addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline.

It is thus truly an elite within an elite. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this elite consider their careers at Eton a failure. [[Boris Johnson]] was a member of Pop, whilst [[David Cameron]] (unlike his elder brother [[Alexander Cameron (barrister)|Alexander]]) failed to be elected, a fact which possibly fed their later political rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|date=11 August 2011|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop wear white and black [[houndstooth]]-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas<ref>Nevill, p.35.</ref> or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; [[Eddie Redmayne]]; and [[Boris Johnson]].\n* <span id=\"SixthFormSelect\">'''Sixth Form Select:'''</span> an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.<ref>McConnell, pp.57, 129\u2013137</ref> Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats. They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms in mid-lesson without knocking and ask in a loud and formal tone, \"Is ([[family name]]) in this division?\" followed by \"He is to see the Head Master at (time) on the bill\" (the ''Bill'', see above).<ref name=\"McConnell, pp.83-84\" /> Members of Sixth Form Select also perform \"Speeches\", a formal event held five times a year.\n* <span id=\"House Captains\">'''House Captains:'''</span> The captains of each of the 25 boys' houses (see above) have disciplinary powers at school level.<ref>McConnell, pp.59\u201362</ref> House Captains are entitled to wear a mottled-grey waistcoat.\n\nIt is possible to belong to ''Pop'' and ''Sixth Form Select'' at the same time.\n\nIn the era of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees.

During this half, Collegers also play the [[Eton wall game]]; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by [[Prince Harry]].  Aided by [[AstroTurf]] facilities on Masters' field, [[field hockey]] has become a major Lent Half sport along with [[Rugby 7's]].

Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the [[didgeridoo]]. The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.

There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.\n\nIn recent years, the School has put on a musical version of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' (October 2009) as well as productions of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (May 2010), ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (February 2011), ''[[Joseph K]]'' (October 2011), ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (May 2012), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (October 2012), ''[[London Assurance]]'' (May 2013), ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'' (October 2013), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (May 2014), \"[[Antigone]]\" (October 2015), \"[[The Government Inspector]]\" (May 2016) and \"[[Romeo and Juliet]]\" (May 2017).

Henry took [[Winchester College]] as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its statutes and removing its headmaster and some of the scholars to start his new school.\n\nWhen Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land.

Legend has it that Edward's mistress, [[Jane Shore]], intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school,<ref>Nevill. p.5.</ref> although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.\n\nConstruction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long,<ref>Nevill, p.5.</ref> with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed.

Building resumed when [[Roger Lupton]] was [[Provost (education)|Provost]], around 1517. His name is borne by the big [[gatehouse]] in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.\n\n\"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel\".<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit. p.119.</ref> This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.\n\n=== 19th century onwards ===\nIn the 19th century, the architect [[John Shaw Jr]] (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton.

In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's ''C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 la bataille de Waterloo'' (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won\").\n\nAs with other public schools,<ref>The Boy's Own Paper Nov 1915 to September 1919</ref> a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.<ref>Arthur C.

However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by [[G. F.

Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the [[World War I|Great War]]. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in [[World War II]] and blew out many windows in the Chapel.

This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990, harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased, a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families, and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=de Bellaigue, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher de Bellaigue|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/eton-and-the-making-of-a-modern-elite|title=Eton and the making of a modern elite|magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August\u2013September 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== School terms ==\n<!--[[Half (Eton)]] redirects here-->\nThere are three academic terms<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etoncollege.com/Michaelmas.aspx |title= The Michaelmas Half |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> (known as halves)<ref>McConnell, p.30</ref> in the year:\n* The ''[[Michaelmas]] Half'', from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.\n* The ''[[Lent]] Half'', from mid-January to late March.\n* The ''Summer Half'', from late April to late June or early July.\n\nThey are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.\n\n== Boys' houses ==\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n{{Main|King's Scholar}}\nOne boarding house, ''College'', is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.\n\nKing's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their [[tailcoat]]s, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: ''togati'', wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a [[surplice]] in Chapel. The house is looked after by the [[Master in College]]. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.\n\n=== Oppidans ===\nAs the school grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These students became known as Oppidans, from the [[Latin]] word ''[[oppidum]]'', meaning \"town\".<ref>McConnell, pp.19\u201320</ref> The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a \"dame\", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.\n\nNot all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in \"College\" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are known as [[Oppidan Scholar]]s.<ref>McConnell, p.177</ref> [[Oppidan Scholar|Oppidan scholarships]] may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations. To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OS''.\n\nEach Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (\"beak\"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720),<ref name=autogenerated1>Pevsner op. cit.</ref> Hawtrey House, [[Richard Durnford|Durnford]] House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.\n\n=== House structure ===\n[[File:MK17840 Eton College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front of Eton College]]\nIn addition to the house master, each house has a house captain and a house captain of games. Some houses have more than one. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term, \"Library\", survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as \"Debate\".\n\nThere are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30&nbsp;p.m. These are known as \"Prayers\", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.\n\nFor much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\" or \"Boy, Queue!\", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as [[fagging]], were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThere are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.\n\n== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n{{Main|List of Head Masters of Eton College}}\n\n== Uniform ==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester 4909925573 1cfc8ea5c0 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1914 dress of a junior Eton pupil, wearing a top hat, neck-tie and \"bum-freezer\", none of which are now worn]]\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or [[morning coat]]) and black [[waistcoat]], a starched [[false-collar|stiff collar]] and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white \"[[Necktie|tie]]\" which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (\"Stick-Ups\"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see [[Eton College#Prefects|School Prefects]] and [[#King's Scholars|King's Scholars]] sections.\n\nThe long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1820<ref>Nevill, p.33.</ref> is unfounded.

The oldest classroom still in use, \"Lower School\", dates from the 15th century.\n\nEvery evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Work.aspx |title=work |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening.

In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious is the [[Newcastle Scholarship]], awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block ([[Year Twelve|Year 12]]); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology. Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.\n\nVarious benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.\n\n== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a \"Show Up\", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress.<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\">McConnell, p.84</ref> If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be \"Commended for Good Effort\" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).\n\nIf any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\",<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\" /> storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.\n\nThe opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\".<ref>McConnell, pp.82\u201383</ref> This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or [[School punishment#Writing lines|writing lines]]. In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.\n\nInternal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called \"Trials\".<ref>McConnell, pp.85\u201389</ref>\n\nA boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).<ref>McConnell, p.42</ref> Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed \"on the Bill\", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.<ref name=\"McConnell, pp.83-84\">McConnell, pp.83\u201384</ref> The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] (suspension) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the school office.\n\nA traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin [[hexameters]]. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, [[Georgics]] (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6351331.stm |title=Cameron defiant over drug claims |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.\n\n=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], generally known as \"beating\".

Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a [[birching]] on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.  [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with [[caning]], also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.<ref>Onyeama, Dillibe (1972). ''Nigger at Eton''. London: Leslie Frewin. p.100. {{ISBN|978-0-85632-003-3}}</ref> Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see [[Eton college#Prefects|Eton Society]] below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.<ref>Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). ''Eton Microcosm''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. {{OCLC|7396426}}</ref>\n\nChenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, [[Michael McCrum]], retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master.

It is thus truly an elite within an elite. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this elite consider their careers at Eton a failure. [[Boris Johnson]] was a member of Pop, whilst [[David Cameron]] (unlike his elder brother [[Alexander Cameron (barrister)|Alexander]]) failed to be elected, a fact which possibly fed their later political rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|date=11 August 2011|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop wear white and black [[houndstooth]]-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas<ref>Nevill, p.35.</ref> or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; [[Eddie Redmayne]]; and [[Boris Johnson]].\n* <span id=\"SixthFormSelect\">'''Sixth Form Select:'''</span> an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.<ref>McConnell, pp.57, 129\u2013137</ref> Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.

During this half, Collegers also play the [[Eton wall game]]; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by [[Prince Harry]].

Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the [[didgeridoo]]. The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.

There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.\n\nIn recent years, the School has put on a musical version of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' (October 2009) as well as productions of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (May 2010), ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (February 2011), ''[[Joseph K]]'' (October 2011), ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (May 2012), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (October 2012), ''[[London Assurance]]'' (May 2013), ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'' (October 2013), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (May 2014), \"[[Antigone]]\" (October 2015), \"[[The Government Inspector]]\" (May 2016) and \"[[Romeo and Juliet]]\" (May 2017). On top of this, every three years, the School holds a fringe-style School Play Festival, where students and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2016, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a double bill of two half an hour plays, to a serialised radio drama, written by a boy in F block (the youngest year.)\n\nOften girls from surrounding schools, such as [[St. George's School, Ascot|St George's, Ascot]], [[St Mary's School Ascot]], [[Windsor Girls' School]] and [[Heathfield St Mary's School]], are cast in female roles.

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) with the [[Oakland Athletics]] (1999\u20132003), [[San Diego Padres]] (2004\u20132005), [[Baltimore Orioles]] (2006\u20132008), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (2009\u20132011), [[Colorado Rockies]] (2012) and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2013).\n\n==Career==\nHern\u00e1ndez is a career .263 [[batting average (baseball)|hitter]] with 144 [[home run]]s, 651 [[Run batted in|RBI]], and 455 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored in 1,132 [[Games played|games]] throughout his 15 seasons with the Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and Baltimore Orioles. Hern\u00e1ndez played in Venezuela for los [[Bravos de Margarita]].\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\nHern\u00e1ndez made his debut with Oakland in June 1999 as a backup catcher for [[A. J. Hinch]]. His steady progress enabled the Athletics to trade Hinch to the [[Kansas City Royals]] a year later.\n\nWith experience, Hern\u00e1ndez became known as a catcher who could solidly hit, mentor young pitchers and had steady defense. He earned praise for his defense and game-calling skills with a powerful [[Pitcher|pitching staff]] that included [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Barry Zito]], [[Mark Mulder]] and [[Tim Hudson]].\n\nIn 2003, Hern\u00e1ndez broke out with his best season, hitting .273 with 21 home runs and 78 RBI and made his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. His most memorable moment as an Athletic came in Game 1 of the 2003 ALDS against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. With the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 12th inning, Hern\u00e1ndez bunted down the third base line, which scored [[Eric Chavez]] to win the game. After the season, Oakland traded him to the Padres, mainly for financial reasons. At the time of the deal, Hern\u00e1ndez had caught at least 135&nbsp;games each of the last four years.\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nIn both 2004 and 2005, Hernandez battled injuries. In 2004, he missed four weeks mid-season after injuring his left knee in a collision at the plate. Upon his return, he batted .281 with 11 home runs with 38 RBI in the second part. He finished the 2004 season with a .276 batting average, 18 home runs, and 63 RBI.\n\nIn 2005, he suffered a  wrist injury on June 17 while diving into first base during a game against the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. His jammed wrist forced him to the [[disabled list]], causing him to miss 18&nbsp;games. Hern\u00e1ndez returned to the lineup on July 7, but the condition worsened and he decided to have surgery to repair the torn cartilage. The surgery forced Hern\u00e1ndez to the DL for the third time in two seasons, and he missed the entire month of August. He rejoined the team in time for the September stretch run, and was pivotal in the Padres' run to the [[National League|National League West]] championship. Hern\u00e1ndez hit .359 in September with five home runs, and drove in 20 runs in just 22&nbsp;games. He came up with several clutch hits, including two dramatic game-winning home runs: a three-run walk-off shot against [[Washington Nationals|Washington]] in the 12th inning on September 17, and a grand slam against division rival [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]] just 10&nbsp;days later. He finished the season with a .290 average and 12 home runs, and became one of baseball's more coveted players in the winter's [[free agent]] market.\n[[File:Hernandez on Third.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hern\u00e1ndez on April 9, 2006, with the [[Baltimore Orioles]].]]\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nBefore the 2006 season, Hern\u00e1ndez signed a $27.5&nbsp;million, four-year contract to play for the Baltimore Orioles. The contract includes a team option for the 2010 season as well. In his introductory press conference, Hern\u00e1ndez spoke excitedly about working with a young pitching staff, hitting in [[Camden Yards]] and helping the team become a contender. He also expressed optimism about spending the next four years with [[Miguel Tejada]] as a teammate (Tejada was traded to the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] before the 2008 season). Hern\u00e1ndez and Tejada played in Oakland for almost five years, and they are godfathers to each other's children. Hern\u00e1ndez would compile a respectable .275 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] in 2006 with 23 [[home run]]s and 91 [[runs batted in|RBI]]. Veterans [[Chris Widger]] and [[Danny Ardoin]] served as Hern\u00e1ndez's backups throughout the season.\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\nHern\u00e1ndez was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for [[Ryan Freel]] and minor leaguers [[Justin Turner]] and [[Brandon Waring]] on December 9, 2008.<ref name=\"mlb\">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081213&content_id=3716596&vkey=hotstove2008&fext=.jsp|title=Hernandez excited to join Reds \u2013 MLB.com: News|publisher=mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> Following the season, the Reds signed Hernandez to a one-year, $3&nbsp;million contract.<ref>[[Ken Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Ken]].

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) with the [[Oakland Athletics]] (1999\u20132003), [[San Diego Padres]] (2004\u20132005), [[Baltimore Orioles]] (2006\u20132008), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (2009\u20132011), [[Colorado Rockies]] (2012) and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2013).\n\n==Career==\nHern\u00e1ndez is a career .263 [[batting average (baseball)|hitter]] with 144 [[home run]]s, 651 [[Run batted in|RBI]], and 455 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored in 1,132 [[Games played|games]] throughout his 15 seasons with the Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and Baltimore Orioles. Hern\u00e1ndez played in Venezuela for los [[Bravos de Margarita]].\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\nHern\u00e1ndez made his debut with Oakland in June 1999 as a backup catcher for [[A. J. Hinch]]. His steady progress enabled the Athletics to trade Hinch to the [[Kansas City Royals]] a year later.\n\nWith experience, Hern\u00e1ndez became known as a catcher who could solidly hit, mentor young pitchers and had steady defense. He earned praise for his defense and game-calling skills with a powerful [[Pitcher|pitching staff]] that included [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Barry Zito]], [[Mark Mulder]] and [[Tim Hudson]].\n\nIn 2003, Hern\u00e1ndez broke out with his best season, hitting .273 with 21 home runs and 78 RBI and made his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. His most memorable moment as an Athletic came in Game 1 of the 2003 ALDS against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. With the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 12th inning, Hern\u00e1ndez bunted down the third base line, which scored [[Eric Chavez]] to win the game. After the season, Oakland traded him to the Padres, mainly for financial reasons. At the time of the deal, Hern\u00e1ndez had caught at least 135&nbsp;games each of the last four years.\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nIn both 2004 and 2005, Hernandez battled injuries. In 2004, he missed four weeks mid-season after injuring his left knee in a collision at the plate. Upon his return, he batted .281 with 11 home runs with 38 RBI in the second part. He finished the 2004 season with a .276 batting average, 18 home runs, and 63 RBI.\n\nIn 2005, he suffered a  wrist injury on June 17 while diving into first base during a game against the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. His jammed wrist forced him to the [[disabled list]], causing him to miss 18&nbsp;games. Hern\u00e1ndez returned to the lineup on July 7, but the condition worsened and he decided to have surgery to repair the torn cartilage. The surgery forced Hern\u00e1ndez to the DL for the third time in two seasons, and he missed the entire month of August. He rejoined the team in time for the September stretch run, and was pivotal in the Padres' run to the [[National League|National League West]] championship. Hern\u00e1ndez hit .359 in September with five home runs, and drove in 20 runs in just 22&nbsp;games. He came up with several clutch hits, including two dramatic game-winning home runs: a three-run walk-off shot against [[Washington Nationals|Washington]] in the 12th inning on September 17, and a grand slam against division rival [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]] just 10&nbsp;days later. He finished the season with a .290 average and 12 home runs, and became one of baseball's more coveted players in the winter's [[free agent]] market.\n[[File:Hernandez on Third.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hern\u00e1ndez on April 9, 2006, with the [[Baltimore Orioles]].]]\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nBefore the 2006 season, Hern\u00e1ndez signed a $27.5&nbsp;million, four-year contract to play for the Baltimore Orioles. The contract includes a team option for the 2010 season as well. In his introductory press conference, Hern\u00e1ndez spoke excitedly about working with a young pitching staff, hitting in [[Camden Yards]] and helping the team become a contender. He also expressed optimism about spending the next four years with [[Miguel Tejada]] as a teammate (Tejada was traded to the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] before the 2008 season). Hern\u00e1ndez and Tejada played in Oakland for almost five years, and they are godfathers to each other's children. Hern\u00e1ndez would compile a respectable .275 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] in 2006 with 23 [[home run]]s and 91 [[runs batted in|RBI]]. Veterans [[Chris Widger]] and [[Danny Ardoin]] served as Hern\u00e1ndez's backups throughout the season.\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\nHern\u00e1ndez was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for [[Ryan Freel]] and minor leaguers [[Justin Turner]] and [[Brandon Waring]] on December 9, 2008.<ref name=\"mlb\">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081213&content_id=3716596&vkey=hotstove2008&fext=.jsp|title=Hernandez excited to join Reds \u2013 MLB.com: News|publisher=mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> Following the season, the Reds signed Hernandez to a one-year, $3&nbsp;million contract.<ref>[[Ken Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Ken]].
