The mass exodus of players leaving forced many youth players like James Milner, Frazier Richidson and Matthew Kilgallon into the first team, despite reaching the quarter finals of the FA cup were Leeds lost to Sheffield United Terry Venables left the club with 8 games left and with former Sunderland manager Peter Reid appointed Leeds finished a disappointing 15th largely thanks to striker [[Mark Viduka]].

a world record for a defender at the time, Robbie Keane, Oliver Dacourt, Lee Bowyer, Robbie Fowler and Johnathan Woodgate would all follow.

District Hospital Shahdol was one among the seven places chosen for the upliftment where now stands a new Medical College. A formal administrative and financial approval was passed by the \u2018Pariyojana Samiksha Samitee\u2019 of the state of M.P. in the year 2016.\n\nGMC Shahdol is an emerging institute with a mission to produce standard \u201cIndian Medical Graduate\u201d through quality education and training, so as to develop a healthy society which can contribute to the national development.Our finely chosen faculty is committed to provide students with the best education the State has to offer. Research practices would be highly encouraged for students to recognize the current health needs of the nation and come up with viable solutions for the medical industry.\n\nThe Institute is spread over an area of 41 acres, housing various buildings like the Academic block, main Hospital block, OPD, Mortuary, Hostels, the Guest House, Auditorium, Playground and various Residential blocks.\n\nIt has four ultra-modern lecture theatres, well-equipped laboratories, seminar rooms, examination hall and a state of the art library. Presently, the institute is beginning its MBBS graduation course; but in the near future, it shall be introducing its postgraduate, nursing, and para-medical courses as well. We\u2019re also trying to bring in facilities for sports and recreation as I want our students to be well rounded individuals.\n\nBeing built in a predominantly tribal area, this college/hospital will cater to the needs of the poor and they\u2019ll be the first ones to benefit from our services. This institute will be the first of its kind to provide comprehensive health services to locals who otherwise only had access to the basic aids.\n\nMy idea is to develop it into a standard and modern Medical institute where there will be a congenial atmosphereconducive to our students developing into humble, empathetic and competent medical graduates; but above all, good human beings.\n\nWith the medical college just breaking ground, it holds a lot of promises for a bright future of all who step on its campus. This is a work in progress, but we the faculty and staff will strive to keep working hard until we have met our goals.\n\n'''Dr. Milind Shiralkar'''\n\n'''DEAN & CEO'''\n\n<br />\n\n* <span class=\"fa fa-map-marker\"></span>\n* <span class=\"fa fa-map-marker\"></span>\n* <span class=\"fa fa-phone\"></span>\n* <span class=\"fa fa-fax\"></span>\n* <span class=\"fa fa-envelope-o\"></span>\n* <span class=\"fa fa-map-marker\"></span>\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n[http://gmcshahdol.org/Deans_Message.aspx#top]{{India-hospital-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Khushal Parihar", "label": "safe", "comment": "deleted some contain what I have add", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Medical_College,_Shahdol"}

Despite progressing to the next round of the Champions League playing in two major tournaments was beginning to take its toll on Leeds young but exhausted squad and in the run up to X-mas and the New Year saw Leeds fall worryingly close to the relegation zone but recently brought Rio Ferdinand for 18 million \u2013 a world record for a defender, Robbie Kean on loan and key players returning from injury Leeds began to pick up impressive form in the Premiership and in the Champions League where they progressed to the quarter final, Leeds were ending the season in red hot form but the Champions League dream came to an end in the semi final and United just missed out on 3rd place on the last day of the season. Failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] was viewed as merely a disappointment by fans of the club, given the success in reaching the semi-final. Next season with the squad fully fit, and without the distraction of the Champions League Leeds would be expected to finish in the top 3 with ease.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|2000\u201301 FA

Despite progressing to the next round of the Champions League playing in two major tournaments was beginning to take it's toll on Leeds young but exhausted squad and in the run up to X-mas and the New Year saw Leeds fall worryingly close to the relegation zone but recently brought Rio Ferdinand for 18 million -a world record for a defender, Robbie Kean on loan and key players returning from injury Leeds begun to pick up impressive form in the Premiership and in the Champions League where they progressed to the quarter final, Leeds were ending the season in red hot form but the Champions League dream came to an end in the semi final and United just missed out on 3rd place on the last day of the season. Failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] was viewed as merely a disappointment by fans of the club, given the success in reaching the semi-final. Next season with the squad fully fit, and without the distraction of the Champions League Leeds would be expected to finish in the top 3 with ease.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|2000\u201301 FA

{"title_page": "William Montgomery Brown", "text_new": "[[File:Brown-William-Montgomery.jpg|thumb|Brown in 1934]]\n'''William Montgomery Brown''' (1855\u20131937), sometimes called \"Bad Bishop\" Brown, was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergyman and author. Brown, of [[Galion, Ohio]], was consecrated a [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], but is best remembered as the first Episcopal bishop to be tried for [[heresy]] since the [[Reformation]], and the first of any creed in America to be deposed for heretical teachings.  He later became a bishop in the [[Old Catholic Church]].\n\n==Biography==\nWilliam Montgomery Brown was born on September 4, 1855, on a farm west of Orrville, Ohio, the son of a Joseph Morrison and Lucina Elzina Cary Brown. His father was a tenant farmer who moved the family to Michigan in 1858, and later enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War. Joseph Brown served in Tennessee before becoming ill, and was sent home to recuperate. He died on August 1, 1862. His mother moved the family back to Ohio, and \"Willy\" was \"hired out\" to a farmer who did not treat the boy well and neglected to provide for his education.<ref name=ghs>[http://www.galionhistory.com/about-bishop-brown/ \"Bishop Brown\", Galion Historical Society]</ref>\n\nWhen Willy was 15, the county placed him with a farmer named Jacob Gardner, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Gardner's piety greatly influenced young Brown. During this time he became seriously ill with typhoid fever. Years later Brown recalled making a bargain with God to devote his life to the ministry if his life would be spared. His health improved and he saved enough from the money his foster parents paid him to leave Ohio just after his 21st birthday. In 1876, Brown traveled to Omaha, Nebraska and got a job driving a carriage for a judge, who arranged for Brown to enter public school.<ref name=ghs/> After graduating, Brown returned to Ohio and worked in a tannery.\n\nPhilanthropist Mary Scranton Bradford agreed to underwrite his education at the Episcopal Seminary, Bexley Hall, at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Mrs. Bradford sent him to Seabury Divinity School in Minnesota from 1879 to 1880 so he could prepare for the seminary course. He finished his studies in 1883, but because he did not take all of his courses at Kenyon, he never received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Bexley.<ref name=ghs/> Brown was ordained and in 1883, became vicar of Grace Church in Galion, Ohio.  In 1891, he became the archdeacon for missionary work in the Diocese of Ohio and wrote his popular ''The Church for Americans'', which explained the beliefs of the Episcopal Church. This placed him in the national spotlight. He was consecrated assistant bishop of Arkansas in 1898 and succeeded to the bishopric after the death of Henry Niles Pierce.<ref name=Carden>[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4722 Carden, Ronald M., \"William Montgomery Brown (1855\u20131937)\", ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas'']</ref> Also in 1898, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Kenyon College.\n\nHis 1907 book ''The Crucial Race Question'', which supported the segregation of the races, greatly angered the Northerners who usually contributed substantial sums to support his poor diocese. Brown created the Helen Dunlap School for Mountain Girls and a seminary to train a local ministry in Arkansas. From 1909 to 1910, he engaged in a sharp conflict with Trinity Cathedral in Little Rock (Pulaski County) over the issue of control over the cathedral and the refusal of the dean to read and compliment the bishop\u2019s new book, ''The Level Plan of Church Union''. This dispute further alienated many in Arkansas. ''The Level Plan'' rejected many practices of the Episcopal Church and angered many supporters, who promptly insisted that he leave. In 1911, he returned to Galion, Ohio, and formally resigned as bishop of Arkansas in 1912, although he remained a bishop without a diocese.<ref name=Carden/> He was succeeded as Bishop of Arkansas by [[James Rideout Winchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://episcopalarkansas.org/old/our-diocese/about-us/ |title=20th Century |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=History of the Diocese |publisher=Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas |access-date= |quote=Bishop James Rideout Winchester succeeded Brown and began the process of repairing the damage.}}</ref>\n\nBrown began reading Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and other authors promoting a materialistic view of the world. Two years later, Brown announced his \"conversion to science\" in July 1913. He wrote to Episcopal bishops informing them of his new position. He rejected the historical Jesus.<ref name=Carden/> \"I no longer believed in a personal God, nor in a six-day creation, nor in a literal heaven and hell,\" Brown wrote. Creeds, he decided, were merely symbolical.<ref name=Mayr>[http://bulletin.kenyon.edu/x3853.xml Mayr, Bill. \"The Red Bishop\", ''Kenyon College Alumni Bulletin'', Vol.34, No.1, Fall 2011]</ref>\n\nBrown's evolution from Bishop of Arkansas (1899\u20131912), to finding an interest in [[Marxism]], [[socialism]], and [[Communism]] during the 1910s, to author of ''Communism and Christianism'' (1920), dramatically increased and challenged his influence in the church. It led to his heresy trial by the House of Bishops in 1924\u201325. There he tried to prove to his fellow bishops that they did not believe in a strict interpretation of the Bible any more than he then did. Nonetheless, Brown was deposed and excommunicated.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = \n| first = \n| author-link = \n| title = 'Heretic' Bishop Brown Proposes A Religion for the Underworld\n| newspaper = The Evening Independent\n| publication-place = St Petersburg, FL\n| volume = XIX\n| issue  = 61\n| date   = January 14, 1926\n| page   = 28\n| url    = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19260114&id=QcpPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OlQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6053,4413063\n}}</ref> However, while awaiting the final verdict on his deposition as bishop in October 1925, he was offered a place in both the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which was heavily influenced by [[History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917\u201327)|Soviet authorities]] at the time, and the [[Old Catholic Church]]. He opted for the latter and was consecrated an Old Catholic bishop in a ceremony conducted in his own study in Galion. Because Old Catholic orders were accepted as valid by the Episcopal Church in the United States, Bishop Brown's position as a bishop in [[apostolic succession]] could not be challenged by his former church.<ref name=Mayr/> Many Old Catholic churches count Bishop Brown in the line of succession of their bishops.\n\nBrown felt that his real ministry began at age 71 when he started lecturing to the working class and writing a wider variety of books.

Brown, of [[Galion, Ohio]], was consecrated a [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], but is best remembered as the first Episcopal bishop to be tried for [[heresy]] since the [[Reformation]], and the first of any creed in America to be deposed for heretical teachings.  He later became a bishop in the [[Old Catholic Church]].\n\n==Biography==\nWilliam Montgomery Brown was born on September 4, 1855, on a farm west of Orrville, Ohio, the son of a Joseph Morrison and Lucina Elzina Cary Brown. His father was a tenant farmer who moved the family to Michigan in 1858, and later enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War. Joseph Brown served in Tennessee before becoming ill, and was sent home to recuperate. He died on August 1, 1862. His mother moved the family back to Ohio, and \"Willy\" was \"hired out\" to a farmer who did not treat the boy well and neglected to provide for his education.<ref name=ghs>[http://www.galionhistory.com/about-bishop-brown/ \"Bishop Brown\", Galion Historical Society]</ref>\n\nWhen Willy was 15, the county placed him with a farmer named Jacob Gardner, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Gardner's piety greatly influenced young Brown. During this time he became seriously ill with typhoid fever. Years later Brown recalled making a bargain with God to devote his life to the ministry if his life would be spared. His health improved and he saved enough from the money his foster parents paid him to leave Ohio just after his 21st birthday. In 1876, Brown traveled to Omaha, Nebraska and got a job driving a carriage for a judge, who arranged for Brown to enter public school.<ref name=ghs/> After graduating, Brown returned to Ohio and worked in a tannery.\n\nPhilanthropist Mary Scranton Bradford agreed to underwrite his education at the Episcopal Seminary, Bexley Hall, at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Mrs. Bradford sent him to Seabury Divinity School in Minnesota from 1879 to 1880 so he could prepare for the seminary course. He finished his studies in 1883, but because he did not take all of his courses at Kenyon, he never received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Bexley.<ref name=ghs/> Brown was ordained and in 1883, became vicar of Grace Church in Galion, Ohio.  In 1891, he became the archbishop for missionary work in the Diocese of Ohio and wrote his popular ''The Church for Americans'', which explained the beliefs of the Episcopal Church. This placed him in the national spotlight. He was consecrated assistant bishop of Arkansas in 1898 and succeeded to the bishopric after the death of Henry Niles Pierce.<ref name=Carden>[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4722 Carden, Ronald M., \"William Montgomery Brown (1855\u20131937)\", ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas'']</ref> Also in 1898, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Kenyon College.\n\nHis 1907 book ''The Crucial Race Question'', which supported the segregation of the races, greatly angered the Northerners who usually contributed substantial sums to support his poor diocese. Brown created the Helen Dunlap School for Mountain Girls and a seminary to train a local ministry in Arkansas. From 1909 to 1910, he engaged in a sharp conflict with Trinity Cathedral in Little Rock (Pulaski County) over the issue of control over the cathedral and the refusal of the dean to read and compliment the bishop\u2019s new book, ''The Level Plan of Church Union''. This dispute further alienated many in Arkansas. ''The Level Plan'' rejected many practices of the Episcopal Church and angered many supporters, who promptly insisted that he leave. In 1911, he returned to Galion, Ohio, and formally resigned as bishop of Arkansas in 1912, although he remained a bishop without a diocese.<ref name=Carden/> He was succeeded as Bishop of Arkansas by [[James Rideout Winchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://episcopalarkansas.org/old/our-diocese/about-us/ |title=20th Century |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=History of the Diocese |publisher=Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas |access-date= |quote=Bishop James Rideout Winchester succeeded Brown and began the process of repairing the damage.}}</ref>\n\nBrown began reading Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and other authors promoting a materialistic view of the world. Two years later, Brown announced his \"conversion to science\" in July 1913. He wrote to Episcopal bishops informing them of his new position. He rejected the historical Jesus.<ref name=Carden/> \"I no longer believed in a personal God, nor in a six-day creation, nor in a literal heaven and hell,\" Brown wrote. Creeds, he decided, were merely symbolical.<ref name=Mayr>[http://bulletin.kenyon.edu/x3853.xml Mayr, Bill. \"The Red Bishop\", ''Kenyon College Alumni Bulletin'', Vol.34, No.1, Fall 2011]</ref>\n\nBrown's evolution from Bishop of Arkansas (1899\u20131912), to finding an interest in [[Marxism]], [[socialism]], and [[Communism]] during the 1910s, to author of ''Communism and Christianism'' (1920), dramatically increased and challenged his influence in the church. It led to his heresy trial by the House of Bishops in 1924\u201325. There he tried to prove to his fellow bishops that they did not believe in a strict interpretation of the Bible any more than he then did. Nonetheless, Brown was deposed and excommunicated.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = \n| first = \n| author-link = \n| title = 'Heretic' Bishop Brown Proposes A Religion for the Underworld\n| newspaper = The Evening Independent\n| publication-place = St Petersburg, FL\n| volume = XIX\n| issue  = 61\n| date   = January 14, 1926\n| page   = 28\n| url    = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19260114&id=QcpPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OlQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6053,4413063\n}}</ref> However, while awaiting the final verdict on his deposition as bishop in October 1925, he was offered a place in both the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which was heavily influenced by [[History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917\u201327)|Soviet authorities]] at the time, and the [[Old Catholic Church]]. He opted for the latter and was consecrated an Old Catholic bishop in a ceremony conducted in his own study in Galion. Because Old Catholic orders were accepted as valid by the Episcopal Church in the United States, Bishop Brown's position as a bishop in [[apostolic succession]] could not be challenged by his former church.<ref name=Mayr/> Many Old Catholic churches count Bishop Brown in the line of succession of their bishops.\n\nBrown felt that his real ministry began at age 71 when he started lecturing to the working class and writing a wider variety of books.

The inverse quantity is '''{{vanchor|electrical conductance|CONDUCTANCE}}''', and is the ease with which an electric current passes.  Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical [[friction]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of electrical resistance is the [[ohm]] ([[Omega|\u03a9]]), while electrical conductance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S).\n\nThe resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of [[electrical insulator]]s like [[rubber]] tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity, while objects made of [[electrical conductor]]s like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity. This relationship is quantified by [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity or conductivity]]. However, resistance and conductance are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive rather than bulk properties]], meaning that they also depend on the size and shape of an object. For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects show some resistance, except for [[superconductor]]s, which have a resistance of zero.\n\nThe resistance ''R'' of an object is defined as the ratio of [[voltage]] ''U'' across it to [[electric current|current]] ''I'' through it, while the conductance ''G'' is the reciprocal:\n:<math>R = {U\\over I}, \\qquad G = {I\\over U} = \\frac{1}{R}</math>\n\nFor a wide variety of materials and conditions, ''U'' and ''I'' are directly proportional to each other, and therefore ''R'' and ''G'' are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials that satisfy it are called ''ohmic'' materials.\n\nIn other cases, such as a [[transformer]], [[diode]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]], ''U'' and ''I'' are ''not'' directly proportional. The ratio ''U'' over ''I'' is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a \"chordal resistance\" or \"static resistance\",<ref name=brown>{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

When a pipe (left) is filled with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[electromotive force]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).]]\n\nIn the [[hydraulic analogy]], current flowing through a wire (or [[resistor]]) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the [[voltage drop]] across the wire is like the [[pressure drop]] that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. (Conductance and resistance are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]].)\n\nThe [[voltage drop]] (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the [[voltage]] itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: The pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)\n\nThe resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:\n* geometry (shape), and\n* material\n\nGeometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.\n\nMaterials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, [[electron]]s can flow freely and easily through a [[copper]] wire, but cannot flow as easily through a [[steel]] wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] like [[rubber]], regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and [[electron configuration]], and is quantified by a property called [[resistivity]].\n\nIn addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Conductors and resistors==\n[[File:Metal film resistor.jpg|thumb|250px|A 75 \u03a9 [[resistor]], as identified by its [[electronic color code]] (violet\u2013green\u2013black\u2013gold\u2013red). <!-- This resistor uses the 4 band variant of the colour code so the bands represent 7 - 5 - 0 - x0.1</sup> making 75 \u03a9 ---> An [[ohmmeter]] could be used to verify this value.]]\n\nSubstances in which electricity can flow are called [[electrical conductor|conductors]]. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a [[resistor]]. Conductors are made of high-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.\n\n==Ohm's law==\n{{main|Ohm's law}}\n[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|500px|The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The horizontal axis is [[voltage drop]], the vertical axis is [[electric current|current]]. Ohm's law is satisfied when the graph is a straight line through the origin. Therefore, the two resistors are ''ohmic'', but the diode and battery are not.]]\n\nFor many materials, the current ''I'' through the material is proportional to the voltage ''U'' applied across it:\n:<math>I \\propto U</math>\nover a wide range of voltages and currents.  Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials which obey it are called ''ohmic'' materials.  Examples of ohmic components are wires and [[resistor]]s. The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage graph]] of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive [[slope (mathematics)|slope]].\n\nOther components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm's law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them.  These are called ''nonlinear'' or ''nonohmic''. Examples include [[diode]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s.  The current-voltage curve of a nonohmic device is a curved line.\n\n== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]\n\nThe resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: What material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|R}} and conductance {{math|G}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  R &= \\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}, \\\\[5pt]\n  G &= \\sigma \\frac{A}{\\ell}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ell</math> is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s (m), ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s (m\u00b2), \u03c3 ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>), and \u03c1 ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: <math>\\rho=1/\\sigma</math>. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\n\nThis formula is not exact, as it assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\n\nAnother situation for which this formula is not exact is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],<ref>Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pp. 17\u201319</ref> or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\n\nThe resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of [[PTFE|teflon]] is about 10<sup>30</sup> times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of \"delocalized\" electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. [[Semiconductor]]s lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]. For the case of [[electrolyte]] solutions, see the article: [[Conductivity (electrolytic)]].\n\nResistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Measuring resistance==\n{{main|Ohmmeter}}\n\nAn instrument for measuring resistance is called an [[ohmmeter]].  Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use [[four-terminal sensing]].\n\n==Typical resistances==\n{{see also|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are called ''non-ohmic'' or ''non-linear'', and their [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage curves]] are ''not'' straight lines through the origin.\n\nResistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its [[Biasing|operating point]]. There are two types of resistance:<ref name=brown/><ref name=kaiser/>\n\n{{glossary start}}\n{{term|Static resistance (also called ''chordal'' or ''DC resistance'')}}{{defn|This corresponds to the usual definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{static} = \\frac {U}{I} \\,</math>.\n\nIt is the slope of the line ([[chord (geometry)|chord]]) from the origin through the point on the curve. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in an electrical component. Points on the current\u2013voltage curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which the slope of the chordal line is negative, have ''negative static resistance''. [[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. However active devices such as transistors or [[op-amp]]s can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as [[gyrator]]s.\n}}\n{{term|Differential resistance (also called ''dynamic'', ''incremental'' or ''small signal resistance'')}}{{defn|[[Electrical resistance#Static and differential resistance|Differential resistance]] is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the [[slope]] of the current\u2013voltage curve at a point\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{diff} = \\frac {dU}{dI}  \\,</math>.\n\nIf the current\u2013voltage curve is non[[monotonic]] (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a negative slope in some regions\u2014so in these regions the device has ''[[negative differential resistance]]''.  Devices with negative differential resistance can amplify a signal applied to them, and are used to make amplifiers and oscillators.  These include [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, [[magnetron]] tubes, and [[unijunction transistor]]s.\n}}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n==AC circuits==\n===Impedance and admittance===\n{{main|Electrical impedance|Admittance}}\n\nWhen an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their [[Phase (waves)|phases]]. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]], the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90\u00b0 out of phase, see image below). [[Complex number]]s are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:\n:<math>u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(U_0 \\cdot e^{j\\omega t}\\right), \\quad i(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(I_0 \\cdot e^{j(\\omega t + \\varphi)}\\right), \\quad \\underline{Z} = \\frac{\\underline{U}}{\\underline{I}}, \\quad \\underline{Y} = \\frac{\\underline{I}}{\\underline{U}}</math>\n\n[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|300px|The voltage (red) and current (blue) versus time (horizontal axis) for a [[capacitor]] (top) and [[inductor]] (bottom). Since the [[amplitude]] of the current and voltage [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] are the same, the [[absolute value]] of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is 1 for both the capacitor and the inductor (in whatever units the graph is using). On the other hand, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is \u221290\u00b0 for the capacitor; therefore, the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor is \u221290\u00b0.

For ideal resistors, <u>''Z''</u> and <u>''Y''</u> reduce to ''R'' and ''G'' respectively, but for AC networks containing [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s, ''X'' and ''B'' are nonzero.\n\n<math>\\underline{Z} = 1/\\underline{Y}</math> for AC circuits, just as <math>R = 1/G</math> for DC circuits.\n\n===Frequency dependence of resistance===\nA key feature of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent, a phenomenon known as the [[universal dielectric response]] <ref>{{cite journal|title=Stress-dependent electrical transport and its universal scaling in granular materials |journal=Extreme Mechanics Letters |volume=22 |pages=83\u201388 |doi=10.1016/j.eml.2018.05.005 |year=2018 |last1=Zhai |first1=Chongpu |last2=Gan |first2=Yixiang |last3=Hanaor |first3=Dorian |last4=Proust |first4=Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle |arxiv=1712.05938 }}</ref>. One reason, mentioned above is the [[skin effect]] (and the related [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see [[Drude model]], [[deep-level trap]]s, [[resonant frequency]], [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relations]], etc.)\n\n==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==\n{{main|Joule heating}}\n[[File:Cartridge-heater-hot.jpg|thumb|Running current through a material with high resistance creates heat, in a phenomenon called [[Joule heating]]. In this picture, a [[cartridge heater]], warmed by Joule heating, is [[Incandescence|glowing red hot]].]]\n\nResistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called ''[[Joule heating]]'' (after [[James Prescott Joule]]), also called ''ohmic heating'' or ''resistive heating''.\n\nThe dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of [[electric power transmission|transmission losses]] in [[overhead power line|power lines]]. [[Electric power transmission|High voltage transmission]] helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.\n\nOn the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in [[electric stove]]s and other [[electric heating|electric heaters]] (also called ''resistive heaters''). As another example, [[incandescent lamp]]s rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows \"white hot\" with [[thermal radiation]] (also called [[incandescence]]).\n\nThe formula for Joule heating is:\n:<math>P=I^2R</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the [[electric power|power]] (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, ''R'' is the resistance, and ''I'' is the current through the resistor.\n\n== Dependence of resistance on other conditions ==\n\n=== Temperature dependence ===\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence}}\nNear room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]].\n\nAs a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a [[resistance thermometer]] or [[thermistor]]. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)\n\nResistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as [[thermometer]]s: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with [[Joule heating]] (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], or for [[feedback]] in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a [[nonlinear element|nonlinear]] and [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] circuit element. For more details see [[Thermistor#Self-heating effects]].\n\nIf the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:\n:<math>R(T) = R_0[1+\\alpha (T - T_0)]</math>\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistance'', <math>T_0</math> is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and <math>R_0</math> is the resistance at temperature <math>T_0</math>. The parameter <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, <math>\\alpha</math> is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that <math>\\alpha</math> was measured at with a suffix, such as <math>\\alpha_{15}</math>, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.<ref>Ward, MR, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36\u201340, McGraw-Hill, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe temperature coefficient <math>\\alpha</math> is typically +3\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> to +6\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.<ref>See [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for a table. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is similar but not identical to the temperature coefficient of resistance. The small difference is due to [[thermal expansion]] changing the dimensions of the resistor.</ref>\n\n=== Strain dependence ===\n{{main|Strain gauge}}\nJust as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. By placing a conductor under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (a form of [[stress (physics)|stress]] that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on [[strain gauge]]s for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.\n\n=== Light illumination dependence ===\n{{main|Photoresistor|Photoconductivity}}\nSome resistors, particularly those made from [[semiconductor]]s, exhibit ''[[photoconductivity]]'', meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called ''[[photoresistor]]s'' (or ''light dependent resistors''). These are a common type of [[photodetector|light detector]].\n\n==Superconductivity==\n{{main|Superconductivity}}\n[[Superconductor]]s are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have V = 0 and I \u2260 0. This also means there is no [[joule heating]], or in other words no [[dissipation]] of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid helium]] for most metallic superconductors like [[niobium\u2013tin]] alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid nitrogen]] for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic [[high temperature superconductors]].\nNevertheless, there are many [[technological applications of superconductivity]], including [[superconducting magnet]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Conductance quantum]]\n** [[Von Klitzing constant]] (its reciprocal)\n* [[Electrical measurements]]\n* [[Contact resistance]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for more information about the physical mechanisms for conduction in materials.\n* [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]]\n* [[Quantum Hall effect]], a standard for high-accuracy resistance measurements.\n* [[Resistor]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n* [[Series and parallel circuits]]\n* [[Sheet resistance]]\n* [[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Thermal resistance]]\n* [[Voltage divider]]\n* [[Voltage drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100711132344/http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/emc/calculators/Resistance_Calculator/index.html''Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory: Resistance Calculator'']\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ElectronConductanceModelsUsingMaximalEntropyRandomWalks/ Electron Conductance Models Using Maximal Entropy Random Walks] Wolfram Demonstrantions Project\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Resistance}}\n[[Category:Electrical resistance and conductance| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|specific applications of conductivity and resistivity in electrical elements|other types of conductivity|Conductivity (disambiguation){{!}}Conductivity|electrical conductivity in general|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n{{Redirect|Resistive|the term used when referring to touchscreens|Resistive touchscreen}}\n{{Electromagnetism|Network}}\nThe '''electrical resistance''' of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. The inverse quantity is '''{{vanchor|electrical conductance|CONDUCTANCE}}''', and is the ease with which an electric current passes.  Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical [[friction]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of electrical resistance is the [[ohm]] ([[Omega|\u03a9]]), while electrical conductance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S).\n\nThe resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of\u2014objects made of [[electrical insulator]]s like [[rubber]] tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity, while objects made of [[electrical conductor]]s like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity. This relationship is quantified by [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity or conductivity]]. However, resistance and conductance are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive rather than bulk properties]], meaning that they also depend on the size and shape of an object. For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects show some resistance, except for [[superconductor]]s, which have a resistance of zero.\n\nThe resistance ''R'' of an object is defined as the ratio of [[voltage]] ''U'' across it to [[electric current|current]] ''I'' through it, while the conductance ''G'' is the reciprocal:\n:<math>R = {U\\over I}, \\qquad G = {I\\over U} = \\frac{1}{R}</math>\n\nFor a wide variety of materials and conditions, ''U'' and ''I'' are directly proportional to each other, and therefore ''R'' and ''G'' are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials that satisfy it are called ''ohmic'' materials.\n\nIn other cases, such as a [[transformer]], [[diode]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]], ''U'' and ''I'' are ''not'' directly proportional. The ratio ''U'' over ''I'' is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a \"chordal resistance\" or \"static resistance\",<ref name=brown>{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

When a pipe (left) is filled with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[electromotive force]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).]]\n\nIn the [[hydraulic analogy]], current flowing through a wire (or [[resistor]]) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the [[voltage drop]] across the wire is like the [[pressure drop]] that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. (Conductance and resistance are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]].)\n\nThe [[voltage drop]] (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the [[voltage]] itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: The pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)\n\nThe resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:\n* geometry (shape), and\n* material\n\nGeometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.\n\nMaterials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, [[electron]]s can flow freely and easily through a [[copper]] wire, but cannot flow as easily through a [[steel]] wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] like [[rubber]], regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and [[electron configuration]], and is quantified by a property called [[resistivity]].\n\nIn addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Conductors and resistors==\n[[File:Metal film resistor.jpg|thumb|250px|A 75 \u03a9 [[resistor]], as identified by its [[electronic color code]] (violet\u2013green\u2013black\u2013gold\u2013red). <!-- This resistor uses the 4 band variant of the colour code so the bands represent 7 - 5 - 0 - x0.1</sup> making 75 \u03a9 ---> An [[ohmmeter]] could be used to verify this value.]]\n\nSubstances in which electricity can flow are called [[electrical conductor|conductors]]. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a [[resistor]]. Conductors are made of high-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.\n\n==Ohm's law==\n{{main|Ohm's law}}\n[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|500px|The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The horizontal axis is [[voltage drop]], the vertical axis is [[electric current|current]]. Ohm's law is satisfied when the graph is a straight line through the origin. Therefore, the two resistors are ''ohmic'', but the diode and battery are not.]]\n\nFor many materials, the current ''I'' through the material is proportional to the voltage ''U'' applied across it:\n:<math>I \\propto U</math>\nover a wide range of voltages and currents.  Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials which obey it are called ''ohmic'' materials.  Examples of ohmic components are wires and [[resistor]]s. The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage graph]] of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive [[slope (mathematics)|slope]].\n\nOther components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm's law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them.  These are called ''nonlinear'' or ''nonohmic''. Examples include [[diode]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s.  The current-voltage curve of a nonohmic device is a curved line.\n\n== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]\n\nThe resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: What material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|R}} and conductance {{math|G}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  R &= \\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}, \\\\[5pt]\n  G &= \\sigma \\frac{A}{\\ell}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ell</math> is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s (m), ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s (m\u00b2), \u03c3 ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>), and \u03c1 ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: <math>\\rho=1/\\sigma</math>. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\n\nThis formula is not exact, as it assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\n\nAnother situation for which this formula is not exact is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],<ref>Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pp. 17\u201319</ref> or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\n\nThe resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of [[PTFE|teflon]] is about 10<sup>30</sup> times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of \"delocalized\" electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. [[Semiconductor]]s lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]. For the case of [[electrolyte]] solutions, see the article: [[Conductivity (electrolytic)]].\n\nResistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Measuring resistance==\n{{main|Ohmmeter}}\n\nAn instrument for measuring resistance is called an [[ohmmeter]].  Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use [[four-terminal sensing]].\n\n==Typical resistances==\n{{see also|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are called ''non-ohmic'' or ''non-linear'', and their [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage curves]] are ''not'' straight lines through the origin.\n\nResistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its [[Biasing|operating point]]. There are two types of resistance:<ref name=brown/><ref name=kaiser/>\n\n{{glossary start}}\n{{term|Static resistance (also called ''chordal'' or ''DC resistance'')}}{{defn|This corresponds to the usual definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{static} = \\frac {U}{I} \\,</math>.\n\nIt is the slope of the line ([[chord (geometry)|chord]]) from the origin through the point on the curve. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in an electrical component. Points on the current\u2013voltage curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which the slope of the chordal line is negative, have ''negative static resistance''. [[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. However active devices such as transistors or [[op-amp]]s can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as [[gyrator]]s.\n}}\n{{term|Differential resistance (also called ''dynamic'', ''incremental'' or ''small signal resistance'')}}{{defn|[[Electrical resistance#Static and differential resistance|Differential resistance]] is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the [[slope]] of the current\u2013voltage curve at a point\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{diff} = \\frac {dU}{dI}  \\,</math>.\n\nIf the current\u2013voltage curve is non[[monotonic]] (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a negative slope in some regions\u2014so in these regions the device has ''[[negative differential resistance]]''.  Devices with negative differential resistance can amplify a signal applied to them, and are used to make amplifiers and oscillators.  These include [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, [[magnetron]] tubes, and [[unijunction transistor]]s.\n}}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n==AC circuits==\n===Impedance and admittance===\n{{main|Electrical impedance|Admittance}}\n\nWhen an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their [[Phase (waves)|phases]]. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]], the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90\u00b0 out of phase, see image below). [[Complex number]]s are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:\n:<math>u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(U_0 \\cdot e^{j\\omega t}\\right), \\quad i(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(I_0 \\cdot e^{j(\\omega t + \\varphi)}\\right), \\quad \\underline{Z} = \\frac{\\underline{U}}{\\underline{I}}, \\quad \\underline{Y} = \\frac{\\underline{I}}{\\underline{U}}</math>\n\n[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|300px|The voltage (red) and current (blue) versus time (horizontal axis) for a [[capacitor]] (top) and [[inductor]] (bottom). Since the [[amplitude]] of the current and voltage [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] are the same, the [[absolute value]] of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is 1 for both the capacitor and the inductor (in whatever units the graph is using). On the other hand, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is \u221290\u00b0 for the capacitor; therefore, the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor is \u221290\u00b0. Similarly, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is +90\u00b0 for the inductor; therefore, the complex phase of the impedance of the inductor is +90\u00b0.]]\n\nwhere:\n* ''t'' is time,\n* ''u(t)'' and ''i(t)'' are, respectively, voltage and current as a function of time,\n* ''U<sub>0</sub>'' and ''I<sub>0</sub>'' indicate the amplitude of voltage respective current,\n* <math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current,\n* <math>\\varphi</math> is the displacement angle,\n* <u>''U''</u>, <u>''I''</u>, <u>''Z''</u>, and <u>''Y''</u> are complex numbers,\n* <u>''Z''</u> is called [[electrical impedance|impedance]],\n* <u>''Y''</u> is called [[admittance]],\n* Re indicates [[real part]],\n* <math>j=\\sqrt{-1}</math> is the [[imaginary unit]].\n\nThe impedance and admittance may be expressed as complex numbers that can be broken into real and imaginary parts:\n:<math>\\underline{Z} = R + jX, \\quad \\underline{Y} = G + jB</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' and ''G'' are resistance and conductance respectively, ''X'' is [[electrical reactance|reactance]], and ''B'' is [[susceptance]]. For ideal resistors, <u>''Z''</u> and <u>''Y''</u> reduce to ''R'' and ''G'' respectively, but for AC networks containing [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s, ''X'' and ''B'' are nonzero.\n\n<math>\\underline{Z} = 1/\\underline{Y}</math> for AC circuits, just as <math>R = 1/G</math> for DC circuits.\n\n===Frequency dependence of resistance===\nA key feature of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent, a phenomenon known as the [[universal dielectric response]] <ref>{{cite journal|title=Stress-dependent electrical transport and its universal scaling in granular materials |journal=Extreme Mechanics Letters |volume=22 |pages=83\u201388 |doi=10.1016/j.eml.2018.05.005 |year=2018 |last1=Zhai |first1=Chongpu |last2=Gan |first2=Yixiang |last3=Hanaor |first3=Dorian |last4=Proust |first4=Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle |arxiv=1712.05938 }}</ref>. One reason, mentioned above is the [[skin effect]] (and the related [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see [[Drude model]], [[deep-level trap]]s, [[resonant frequency]], [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relations]], etc.)\n\n==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==\n{{main|Joule heating}}\n[[File:Cartridge-heater-hot.jpg|thumb|Running current through a material with high resistance creates heat, in a phenomenon called [[Joule heating]]. In this picture, a [[cartridge heater]], warmed by Joule heating, is [[Incandescence|glowing red hot]].]]\n\nResistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called ''[[Joule heating]]'' (after [[James Prescott Joule]]), also called ''ohmic heating'' or ''resistive heating''.\n\nThe dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of [[electric power transmission|transmission losses]] in [[overhead power line|power lines]]. [[Electric power transmission|High voltage transmission]] helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.\n\nOn the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in [[electric stove]]s and other [[electric heating|electric heaters]] (also called ''resistive heaters''). As another example, [[incandescent lamp]]s rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows \"white hot\" with [[thermal radiation]] (also called [[incandescence]]).\n\nThe formula for Joule heating is:\n:<math>P=I^2R</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the [[electric power|power]] (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, ''R'' is the resistance, and ''I'' is the current through the resistor.\n\n== Dependence of resistance on other conditions ==\n\n=== Temperature dependence ===\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence}}\nNear room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]].\n\nAs a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a [[resistance thermometer]] or [[thermistor]]. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)\n\nResistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as [[thermometer]]s: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with [[Joule heating]] (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], or for [[feedback]] in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a [[nonlinear element|nonlinear]] and [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] circuit element. For more details see [[Thermistor#Self-heating effects]].\n\nIf the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:\n:<math>R(T) = R_0[1+\\alpha (T - T_0)]</math>\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistance'', <math>T_0</math> is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and <math>R_0</math> is the resistance at temperature <math>T_0</math>. The parameter <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, <math>\\alpha</math> is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that <math>\\alpha</math> was measured at with a suffix, such as <math>\\alpha_{15}</math>, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.<ref>Ward, MR, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36\u201340, McGraw-Hill, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe temperature coefficient <math>\\alpha</math> is typically +3\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> to +6\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.<ref>See [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for a table. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is similar but not identical to the temperature coefficient of resistance. The small difference is due to [[thermal expansion]] changing the dimensions of the resistor.</ref>\n\n=== Strain dependence ===\n{{main|Strain gauge}}\nJust as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. By placing a conductor under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (a form of [[stress (physics)|stress]] that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on [[strain gauge]]s for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.\n\n=== Light illumination dependence ===\n{{main|Photoresistor|Photoconductivity}}\nSome resistors, particularly those made from [[semiconductor]]s, exhibit ''[[photoconductivity]]'', meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called ''[[photoresistor]]s'' (or ''light dependent resistors''). These are a common type of [[photodetector|light detector]].\n\n==Superconductivity==\n{{main|Superconductivity}}\n[[Superconductor]]s are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have V = 0 and I \u2260 0. This also means there is no [[joule heating]], or in other words no [[dissipation]] of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid helium]] for most metallic superconductors like [[niobium\u2013tin]] alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid nitrogen]] for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic [[high temperature superconductors]].\nNevertheless, there are many [[technological applications of superconductivity]], including [[superconducting magnet]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Conductance quantum]]\n** [[Von Klitzing constant]] (its reciprocal)\n* [[Electrical measurements]]\n* [[Contact resistance]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for more information about the physical mechanisms for conduction in materials.\n* [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]]\n* [[Quantum Hall effect]], a standard for high-accuracy resistance measurements.\n* [[Resistor]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n* [[Series and parallel circuits]]\n* [[Sheet resistance]]\n* [[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Thermal resistance]]\n* [[Voltage divider]]\n* [[Voltage drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100711132344/http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/emc/calculators/Resistance_Calculator/index.html''Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory: Resistance Calculator'']\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ElectronConductanceModelsUsingMaximalEntropyRandomWalks/ Electron Conductance Models Using Maximal Entropy Random Walks] Wolfram Demonstrantions Project\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Resistance}}\n[[Category:Electrical resistance and conductance| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n", "name_user": "Batard0", "label": "safe", "comment": "Separated one sentence into two sentences for better flow.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"}
