From the FAA Air Directive: \"The potential loss of the stale-data monitoring function of the CCS when continuously powered on for 51 days, if not addressed, could result in erroneous flight-critical data being routed and displayed as valid data, which could reduce the ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/}}\n\n{{Intel software}}\n{{Real-time operating systems}}\n\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Intel software]]\n[[Category:MIPS operating systems]]\n[[Category:PowerPC operating systems]]\n[[Category:Real-time operating systems]]\n[[Category:Robot operating systems]]\n[[Category:X86 operating systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=June 2017}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2014}}\n{{prose|date=July 2014}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=August 2014}}\n}}\n{{Infobox OS\n| name                   = VxWorks\n| logo                   = VxWorks symbol by Wind River Systems.png\n| logo_size              = 65px\n| screenshot             = File:VxWorks_7_Bootup_Screen.png\n| screenshot_size        = 200px\n| caption                = VxWorks 7 boot-up screen\n| developer              = [[Wind River Systems|Wind River]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[TPG Capital]])\n| source_model           =\n| kernel_type            = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]]\n| supported_platforms    = [[x86]] (including [[Intel Quark]]), [[x86-64]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH|SH-4]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]]\n| ui                     =\n| family                 = [[Real-time operating system]]s\n| released               = {{start date and age|1987}}\n| latest_release_version = 7\n| latest_release_date    = {{start date and age|2014|03}}\n| latest_test_version    = \n| latest_test_date       =\n| marketing_target       = [[Embedded system]]s\n| updatemodel            =\n| package_manager        =\n| license                = Proprietary\n| working state          = Current\n| website                = {{URL|https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks|Windriver.com/products/vxworks}}\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''VxWorks''' is a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) developed as [[proprietary software]] by [[Wind River Systems]], a wholly owned subsidiary of TPG Capital, US.

Europeans first explored the area of Salem in 1671, when the [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking [[Tutelo people|Totero]] people had a village nearby.<ref name=swanton>{{citation| last=Swanton| first=John R.| title=The Indian Tribes of North America| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| year=1952| url=https://books.google.com/?id=vtHI5pkJOGMC| isbn=0-8063-1730-2| pages=73| oclc=52230544}}</ref> Explorers Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam gave the area its first recorded name: Totero Town, after this tribe, who supplied them with a guide to help with further exploration. Fort Lewis, named for General [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Andrew Lewis]], of what is now [[Roanoke County]], was built west of the town in 1752. Salem's Andrew Lewis Middle School (formerly Andrew Lewis High School) was named after General Lewis. Salem became a small settlement serving travelers on the Great Road (roughly the same path followed by [[US-11]] and later [[Interstate 81]] today) and was officially founded in 1802, receiving its charter in 1806.  It is not known why the town was named Salem; the most widely accepted explanation is that it was named to honor William Bryan, a prominent citizen, who had moved from [[Salem, New Jersey]].\n\nSalem was attacked twice by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], but its Salem Flying Artillery is said to have fired the last Confederate shot at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] prior to [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender.\n\nOne of the city's four elementary schools is named after African American scientist [[George Washington Carver|G. W. Carver]]. Before integration, this was the high school for African Americans in Salem.\n\nSalem annexed South Salem in 1953 and also an eastern tract in 1960, giving it a population of 16,058 \u2013 making it Virginia's largest ''town'' at the time. Salem officially became a city on December 31, 1967, to avoid the possibility of annexation into the city of Roanoke. Per the Virginia constitution, it was separated from Roanoke County. However, it remains the county seat.\n\nSalem has been the home of two colleges. In 1847, the Virginia Institute, a boy's preparatory school, moved to Salem from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. It received a college charter in 1853 and was renamed [[Roanoke College]] for the [[Roanoke Valley]]. The college is located in central Salem, one block north of Main Street. Roanoke Women's College, later named [[Elizabeth College, Virginia|Elizabeth College]], operated between 1912 and 1922. The college burned in late 1921 and did not reopen. Like Roanoke College, it was affiliated with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. The Elizabeth College campus is now the site of residence halls and athletic fields that belong to [[Roanoke College]].\n\nSalem is home to the [[Salem Red Sox]], a High Class-A affiliate to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[NCAA Division III national football championship|Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl, the NCAA Division III Football Championship game]] was held at [[Salem Football Stadium]] between 1993 and 2016. Salem's success in holding that event led the [[NCAA]] to also move the [[NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship]] and the NCAA Division III Volleyball Championship to the [[Salem Civic Center]] and the Women's NCAA Division III Softball Championship to Moyer Field. In August 2007, the Salem Football Stadium also hosted the Southwestern Virginia Educational Classic. This game is played annually in the Roanoke Valley and consists of two football teams from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  The city hosts several other statewide, regional, and national sporting events at its facilities.  These events are attracted by the city's hospitality, modern facilities and overall support.

First, it promotes the release of [[free fatty acid]]s (FFAs) from [[adipose tissue]] into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of [[triglyceride]]s, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are [[lipolysis|broken down]] into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via [[Lipogenesis|''de novo'' lipogenesis]]; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%).<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as [[diacylglycerol]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[ceramide]]s, and free [[cholesterol]], have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>  \n\nOnce NAFLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases  secretion of the insulin-sensitizing [[adipokine]] [[adiponectin]] in people with NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased ''de novo'' lipogenesis, decreased [[gluconeogenesis|glucose production in the liver]], [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, and [[Antifibrotic|anti-fibrotic]] properties.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> [[Skeletal muscle]] insulin resistance may also play a role in NAFLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in [[glycogen]] stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for ''de novo'' lipogenesis in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>\n\n===Dysbiosis===\nDisruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways. People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and [[proteobacteria]] (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation.<ref name=Leung2016 /> Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide|bacterial toxins]], and [[Cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]]).

The presence of at least 5% [[fatty liver]] is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /> Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and \"NASH\".

First, it promotes the release of [[free fatty acid]]s (FFAs) from [[adipose tissue]] into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of [[triglyceride]]s, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are [[lipolysis|broken down]] into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via [[Lipogenesis|''de novo'' lipogenesis]]; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%).<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as [[diacylglycerol]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[ceramide]]s, and free [[cholesterol]], have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>  \n\nOnce NAFLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases  secretion of the insulin-sensitizing [[adipokine]] [[adiponectin]] in people with NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased ''de novo'' lipogenesis, decreased [[gluconeogenesis|glucose production in the liver]], [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, and [[Antifibrotic|anti-fibrotic]] properties.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> [[Skeletal muscle]] insulin resistance may also play a role in NAFLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in [[glycogen]] stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for ''de novo'' lipogenesis in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>\n\n===Dysbiosis===\nDisruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways. People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and [[proteobacteria]] (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation.<ref name=Leung2016 /> Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide|bacterial toxins]], and [[Cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]]).

The presence of at least 5% [[fatty liver]] is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /> Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and \"NASH\".
