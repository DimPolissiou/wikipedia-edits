During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote=\"An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...\", \"The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world.\"|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl}}</ref> The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]]<ref name=\"Knapp\"/> and argued that the nation is a \"daily plebiscite\" formed by the subjective \"will to live together\". Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France'' (1993).</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: \"[[Workers of the world, unite!]]\", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman.

Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black & Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world \u2013 such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India \u2013 argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian left|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}\nThe original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=\"Knapp\"/> [[Karl Marx]] asserted that \"[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.

In 1918, \"ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot\" and \"children were deprived of any religious education outside the home\".<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41\u201343.</ref> Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].\n\nHowever, religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries.

[[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France'' (1993).</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: \"[[Workers of the world, unite!]]\", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman.

Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black & Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world \u2013 such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India \u2013 argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian left|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}\nThe original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=\"Knapp\"/> [[Karl Marx]] asserted that \"[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.

In 1918, \"ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot\" and \"children were deprived of any religious education outside the home\".<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41\u201343.</ref> Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].\n\nHowever, religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries.

[[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

One of the first actions of the Labour Party leader who succeeded them, [[Ed Miliband]], was the rejection of the \"New Labour\" label. However, Labour's voting record in parliament would indicate that under Miliband it had maintained the same distance from the left as it had with Blair.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26743802|work=BBC News|title=MPs approve annual welfare cap in Commons vote|date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|author=John Kampfner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/labour-back-on-the-right|title=Labour's return to the right|journal=The Guardian|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> Likewise, the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as Labour Party leader was viewed by some as Labour turning back toward its socialist roots.\n\nLeftist [[postmodernism]] opposes attempts to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as [[Meta-narrative|grand narratives]].

We recorded a few tracks, one of which I wrote more or less as a throwaway. That was 'Roxanne', I didn't think much more about it until we played the album to Miles Copeland who is, of course, Stewart's brother and a bit of an entrepreneur, though he'd never been particularly interested in The Police. In fact, he'd kept away from it to say the least. He did come along to the sessions while we were putting the first album together but more or less just to offer brotherly advice to Stewart. He heard the album and quite liked it. When we got to Roxanne, we were a bit embarrassed because the song was a bit of an anachronism, because compared with our usual material it was slow, quiet and melodic. Far from saying he thought it was a piece of shit, he said it was amazing. I thought, 'He likes this song.

He was very shy at first bringing in his songs. But it was brilliant, and later on we all worked it out in a damp basement in North London. I remember Stewart telling Sting where to place the bass notes, which was a bit tricky. Miles Copeland came down to hear us and we were kind of embarrassed to play it for him, because Miles had blinders on and was into fast and furious punk. But much to his credit, he said, 'This is great, a knockout!' I was really surprised. And he took it to A&M and got a contract for one single.

We recorded a few tracks, one of which I wrote more or less as a throwaway. That was 'Roxanne', I didn't think much more about it until we played the album to Miles Copeland who is, of course, Stewart's brother and a bit of an entrepreneur, though he'd never been particularly interested in The Police. In fact, he'd kept away from it to say the least. He did come along to the sessions while we were putting the first album together but more or less just to offer brotherly advice to Stewart. He heard the album and quite liked it. When we got to Roxanne, we were a bit embarrassed because the song was a bit of an anachronism, because compared with our usual material it was slow, quiet and melodic.

He was very shy at first bringing in his songs. But it was brilliant, and later on we all worked it out in a damp basement in North London. I remember Stewart telling Sting where to place the bass notes, which was a bit tricky. Miles Copeland came down to hear us and we were kind of embarrassed to play it for him, because Miles had blinders on and was into fast and furious punk.
