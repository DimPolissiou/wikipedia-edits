The dance involves very conspicuous wriggling and shaking motions, especially in comparison to the species'  otherwise extremely secretive lifestyle. Under the threat or presence of a predator, pipefish are more reluctant to perform their dances. In addition, when risk of predation is high, they copulate less frequently, dance less per copulation, and females transfer more eggs per copulation. Although ''S. thyphle'' males normally prefer to mate with larger females, they mate randomly when potentially threatened by predators.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Risky sex: male pipefishes mate at random in the presence of a predator| author = Anders Berglund | date = July 1993 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1172 | volume=46 | issue=1 | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=169\u2013175| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b23a517ca3a2cee83f6ab111848b1aec9db81fb9 }}</ref> Furthermore, in ''Corythoichthys haematopterus,'' similar ritualized mating dances were hypothesized to aid in reproductive synchronization, by allowing the female to assess male willingness to spawn so her eggs aren't wasted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sogabe|first=A.|last2=Yanagisawa|first2=Y.|date=2007-08-01|title=The function of daily greetings in a monogamous pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|language=en|volume=71|issue=2|pages=585\u2013595|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01523.x|issn=1095-8649}}</ref>\n\nDuring pipefish copulation, which signifies the termination of the courtship dance, the female transfers her eggs through a small [[ovipositor]] into the male brood pouch or onto the special patch of skin on the male\u2019s ventral body surface. While the eggs are being transferred, the mating pair rises through the water until copulation is complete. At this point, the male assumes an S-shaped posture and fertilizes the eggs, all the while travelling back down the water column.<ref name=\"Parental Care\">{{cite book|last=Sagebakken|title=Parental care and brood reduction in a pipefish|year=2012|publisher=Goteborg|isbn=978-91-628-8532-8}}</ref>  Males possessing brood pouches release their sperm directly into them; the pouches are then vigorously shaken.

Females can often produce more eggs than males can accommodate inside their brood pouches, resulting in more eggs than can be cared for. Other factors may restrict female reproductive success, including male pregnancy length and energy investment in progeny.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reproductive Success of Females Limited by Males in Two Pipefish Species | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 506\u2013516 |author1=Anders Berglund |author2=Gunilla Rosenqvist |author3=Ingrid Svensson | year = 1989 | jstor = 2462085 | doi = 10.1086/284932 }}</ref> Because the pipefish embryos develop within the male, feeding on nutrients supplied by him, male pipefish invest more energy than females in each zygote.

Pregnant male pipefish can absorb nutrients from their broods, in a manner very similar to [[filial cannibalism]]  found in many other families of fish. The smallest eggs in a brood of various egg sizes usually have lower survival rates than larger ones, due to the larger eggs being competitively superior and more likely to develop into mature adults. In other instances, some pipefishes may consume the embryos of mates that seem less fit or desirable, as each male generally copulates with more than one female.<ref name=\"Parental Care\" />\n\nYoung are born free-swimming with relatively little or no yolk sac, and begin feeding immediately. From the time they hatch, they are independent of their parents, which at that time may view them as food. Some fry have short larval stages and live as plankton for a short while. Others are fully developed but miniature versions of their parents, assuming the same behaviors as their parents immediately.\n\nPair bonding varies wildly between different species of pipefish. While some are [[monogamous]] or seasonally monogamous, others are not.\n \nMany species exhibit [[polyandry]], a breeding system in which one female mates with two or more males. This tends to occur with greater frequency in internal-brooding species of pipefishes than with external-brooding ones due to limitation in male brood capacity.<ref>{{Cite

Although ''S. thyphle'' males normally prefer to mate with larger females, they mate randomly when potentially threatened by predators.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Risky sex: male pipefishes mate at random in the presence of a predator| author = Anders Berglund | date = July 1993 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1172 | volume=46 | issue=1 | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=169\u2013175| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b23a517ca3a2cee83f6ab111848b1aec9db81fb9 }}</ref> Furthermore, in ''Corythoichthys haematopterus,'' similar ritualized mating dances were hypothesized to aid in reproductive synchronization, by allowing the female to assess male willingness to spawn so her eggs aren't wasted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sogabe|first=A.|last2=Yanagisawa|first2=Y.|date=2007-08-01|title=The function of daily greetings in a monogamous pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|language=en|volume=71|issue=2|pages=585\u2013595|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01523.x|issn=1095-8649}}</ref>\n\nDuring pipefish copulation, which signifies the termination of the courtship dance, the female transfers her eggs through a small [[ovipositor]] into the male brood pouch or onto the special patch of skin on the male\u2019s ventral body surface. While the eggs are being transferred, the mating pair rises through the water until copulation is complete. At this point, the male assumes an S-shaped posture and fertilizes the eggs, all the while travelling back down the water column.<ref name=\"Parental Care\">{{cite book|last=Sagebakken|title=Parental care and brood reduction in a pipefish|year=2012|publisher=Goteborg|isbn=978-91-628-8532-8}}</ref>  Males possessing brood pouches release their sperm directly into them; the pouches are then vigorously shaken.

Females can often produce more eggs than males can accommodate inside their brood pouches, resulting in more eggs than can be cared for. Other factors may restrict female reproductive success, including male pregnancy length and energy investment in progeny.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reproductive Success of Females Limited by Males in Two Pipefish Species | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 506\u2013516 |author1=Anders Berglund |author2=Gunilla Rosenqvist |author3=Ingrid Svensson | year = 1989 | jstor = 2462085 | doi = 10.1086/284932 }}</ref> Because the pipefish embryos develop within the male, feeding on nutrients supplied by him, male pipefish invest more energy than females in each zygote. Additionally, they invest more energy per unit time than females throughout each breeding season.<ref>{{cite web | title = Reversed sex roles and parental energy investment in zygotes of two pipefish (Syngnathidae) species| url = https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/29/m029p209.pdf | publisher = Marine Ecology Progress Series |author1=Anders Berglund |author2=Gunilla Rosenqvist |author3=Ingrid Svensson | date = 1986-03-26 | accessdate = 2013-09-15 }}</ref> As a result, some males may consume their embryos rather than continuing to rear them under situations in which their bodies are exhausted of resources,  to regain energy. Pregnant male pipefish can absorb nutrients from their broods, in a manner very similar to [[filial cannibalism]]  found in many other families of fish. The smallest eggs in a brood of various egg sizes usually have lower survival rates than larger ones, due to the larger eggs being competitively superior and more likely to develop into mature adults. In other instances, some pipefishes may consume the embryos of mates that seem less fit or desirable, as each male generally copulates with more than one female.<ref name=\"Parental Care\" />\n\nYoung are born free-swimming with relatively little or no yolk sac, and begin feeding immediately. From the time they hatch, they are independent of their parents, which at that time may view them as food. Some fry have short larval stages and live as plankton for a short while. Others are fully developed but miniature versions of their parents, assuming the same behaviors as their parents immediately.\n\nPair bonding varies wildly between different species of pipefish. While some are [[monogamous]] or seasonally monogamous, others are not.\n \nMany species exhibit [[polyandry]], a breeding system in which one female mates with two or more males. This tends to occur with greater frequency in internal-brooding species of pipefishes than with external-brooding ones due to limitation in male brood capacity.<ref>{{Cite

It was the ninth round of the [[2014 Formula One World Championship]], and the 65th [[British Grand Prix]] to be held as part of the series. [[Lewis Hamilton]] of the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] team won the 52-lap race, from a sixth position start. [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] driver [[Valtteri Bottas]] finished second, with [[Daniel Ricciardo]] third for the [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] squad.

Rosberg led for 18 laps after the restart as Hamilton moved to second, then made a [[pit stop]] for tyres, giving the lead to Hamilton for six laps. Hamilton took the lead for good when Rosberg retired from a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] fault on the 29th lap; he won by more than half a minute over Bottas. Ricciardo held off [[McLaren]]'s [[Jenson Button]] in the final laps to take third.\n\nRosberg's non-finish left him with a reduced lead of four [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Hamilton in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]].

Hamilton took the lead for good when Rosberg retired from a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] fault on the 29th lap; he won by more than half a minute over Bottas. Ricciardo held off [[McLaren]]'s [[Jenson Button]] in the final laps to take third.\n\nRosberg's non-finish left him with a reduced lead of four [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Hamilton in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]].

{"title_page": "Brouwer fixed-point theorem", "text_new": "<!-- The French version of this article is a featured article. Large portions have been translated and inserted here in 2009. -->\n'''Brouwer's fixed-point theorem''' is a [[fixed-point theorem]] in [[topology]], named after [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. (Bertus) Brouwer]]. It states that for any [[continuous function]] <math>f</math> mapping a [[compactness|compact]] [[convex set]] to itself there is a point <math>x_0</math> such that <math>f(x_0)=x_0</math>. The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions <math>f</math> from a closed interval <math>I</math> in the real numbers to itself or from a closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] <math>D</math> to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a convex compact subset <math>K\n</math> of [[Euclidean space]] to itself.\n\nAmong hundreds of [[fixed-point theorem]]s,<ref>E.g. F & V Bayart ''[http://www.bibmath.net/dico/index.php3?action=affiche&quoi=./p/pointfixe.html Th\u00e9or\u00e8mes du point fixe]'' on Bibm@th.net  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226200755/http://www.bibmath.net/dico/index.php3?action=affiche&quoi=.%2Fp%2Fpointfixe.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}</ref> Brouwer's is particularly well known, due in part to its use across numerous fields of mathematics.\nIn its original field, this result is one of the key theorems characterizing the topology of Euclidean spaces, along with the [[Jordan curve theorem]], the [[hairy ball theorem]] and the [[Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem]].<ref>See page 15 of: D. Leborgne ''Calcul diff\u00e9rentiel et g\u00e9om\u00e9trie'' Puf (1982) {{ISBN|2-13-037495-6}}</ref>\nThis gives it a place among the fundamental theorems of topology.<ref>More exactly, according to Encyclop\u00e9die Universalis: ''Il en a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l'un des plus beaux th\u00e9or\u00e8mes, le th\u00e9or\u00e8me du point fixe, dont les applications et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations, de la th\u00e9orie des jeux aux \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles, se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es fondamentales.'' [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/T705705/BROUWER_L.htm Luizen Brouwer] by G. Sabbagh</ref> The theorem is also used for proving deep results about [[differential equation]]s and is covered in most introductory courses on [[differential geometry]].\nIt appears in unlikely fields such as [[game theory]]. In economics, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem and its extension, the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]], play a central role in the [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model|proof of existence]] of [[general equilibrium]] in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]].\n\nThe theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Charles \u00c9mile Picard]]. Proving results such as the [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem]] requires the use of topological methods.

The following examples show why the pre-conditions are important.\n\n===Boundedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = x+1,</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. The space <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is convex and closed, but not bounded.\n\n===Closedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{x+1}{2},</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from the open interval (\u22121,1) to itself. In this interval, it shifts every point to the right, so it cannot have a fixed point. The space (\u22121,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. The function ''f'' {{em|does}} have a fixed point for the closed interval [\u22121,1], namely ''f''(1) = 1.\n\n===Convexity===\nConvexity is not strictly necessary for BFPT. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under [[homeomorphism]]s, BFPT is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball <math>D^n</math>. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also [[closed set|closed]], bounded, [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected|without holes]], etc.).\n\nThe following example shows that BFPT doesn't work for domains with holes. Consider the  function <math>f(x)=-x</math>,\nwhich is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. Since ''-x\u2260x'' holds for any point of the unit circle, ''f'' has no fixed point. The analogous example works for the ''n''-dimensional sphere (or any symmetric domain that does not contain the origin). The unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex) . The function ''f'' {{em|does}} have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.\n\nA formal generalization of BFPT for \"hole-free\" domains can be derived from the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/323841 | title=Why is convexity a requirement for Brouwer fixed points? | publisher=Math StackExchange | accessdate=22 May 2015 | author=Belk, Jim}}</ref>\n\n===Notes===\nThe continuous function in this theorem is not required to be [[bijective]] or even [[surjective]].\n\n==Illustrations==\nThe theorem has several \"real world\" illustrations. Here are some examples.\n\n1. Take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the ''n'' = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it.\n\n2. Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country.  There will always be a \"You are Here\" point on the map which represents that same point in the country.\n\n3. In three dimensions a consequence of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no matter how much you stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume.  Ordering a cocktail [[shaken, not stirred]] defeats the convexity condition (\"shaking\" being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid).  In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Intuitive approach==\n\n===Explanations attributed to Brouwer===\nThe theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of coffee.<ref>The interest of this anecdote rests in its intuitive and didactic character, but its accuracy is dubious. As the history section shows, the origin of the theorem is not Brouwer's work. More than 20 years earlier [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] had proved an equivalent result, and 5 years before Brouwer P.&nbsp;Bohl had proved the three-dimensional case.</ref>\nIf one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.\nHe drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.<ref name=Arte>This citation comes originally from a television broadcast: ''[https://archive.is/20130113210953/http://archives.arte.tv/hebdo/archimed/19990921/ftext/sujet5.html Archim\u00e8de]'', [[Arte]], 21 septembre 1999</ref>\nThe fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.\nThe result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.\n\nBrouwer is said to have added: \"I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.\"<ref name=Arte />\nBrouwer \"flattens\" his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. Unlike the coffee cup example, the crumbled paper example also demonstrates that more than one fixed point may exist. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as [[Stefan Banach]]'s, that guarantee uniqueness.\n\n===One-dimensional case===\n[[File:Th\u00e9or\u00e8me-de-Brouwer-dim-1.svg|200px|right]]\nIn one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove.  The continuous function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] and takes values in the same interval.  Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] which maps ''x'' to ''x'' (light green).\n\nIntuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal.  To prove this, consider the function ''g'' which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;-&nbsp;''x''. It is \u2265&nbsp;0 on ''a'' and \u2264&nbsp;0 on&nbsp;''b''.  By the [[intermediate value theorem]], ''g'' has a [[Root of a function|zero]] in [''a'',&nbsp;''b'']; this zero is a fixed point.\n\nBrouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: \"Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.\"<ref name=Arte />\n\n==History==\nThe Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of [[algebraic topology]], and is the basis of more general [[fixed point theorem]]s which are important in [[functional analysis]]. The case ''n'' = 3 first was proved by [[Piers Bohl]] in 1904 (published in ''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'').<ref name=Bohl1904>{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Bohl |title=  \u00dcber die Bewegung eines mechanischen Systems in der N\u00e4he einer Gleichgewichtslage |journal=J.

Modern accounts of the proof can also be found in the literature.<ref>{{citation | last = Teschl| first = Gerald| authorlink = Gerald Teschl| title = Topics in Real and Functional Analysis| chapter-url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-fa/index.html|chapter=14.4: The Brouwer fixed point theorem|year=2005|accessdate=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>K=\\overline{B(0)}</math> denote the closed unit ball in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> centered at the origin.  Suppose for simplicitly that <math>f:K\\to K</math> is continuously differentiable.  A [[regular value]] of <math>f</math> is a point <math>p\\in B(0)</math> such that the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of <math>f</math> is non-singular at every point of the preimage of <math>p</math>.  In particular, by the [[inverse function theorem]], every point of the preimage of <math>f</math> lies in <math>B(0)</math> (the interior of <math>K</math>).  The degree of <math>f</math> at a regular value <math>p\\in B(0)</math> is defined as the sum of the signs of the [[Jacobian determinant]] of <math>f</math> over the preimages of <math>p</math> under <math>f</math>:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{deg}_p(f) = \\sum_{x\\in f^{-1}(p)} \\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\det(Df(x))\\right).</math>\n\nThe degree is, roughly speaking, the number of \"sheets\" of the preimage ''f'' lying over a small open set around ''p'', with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented.  This is thus a generalization of [[winding number]] to higher dimensions.\n\nThe degree satisfies the property of ''homotopy invariance'': let <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> be two continuously differentiable functions, and <math>H_t(x)=tf+(1-t)g</math> for <math>0\\le t\\le 1</math>.  Suppose that the point <math>p</math> is a regular value of <math>H_t</math> for all ''t''.  Then <math>\\deg_p f = \\deg_p g</math>.\n\nIf there is no fixed point of the boundary of <math>K</math>, then the function \n:<math>g(x)=\\frac{x-f(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-f(x)\\right|}</math>\n\nis well-defined, and \n\n<math>H(t,x) = \\frac{x-tf(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-tf(x)\\right|}</math>\n\ndefines a homotopy from the identity function to it.  The identity function has degree one at every point.  In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so <math>g</math> also has degree one at the origin.  As a consequence, the preimage <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> is not empty.  The elements of <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> are precisely the fixed points of the original function ''f''.\n\nThis requires some work to make fully general.  The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of ''f'', and then to continuous functions.  The more modern advent of [[homology theory]] simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.\n\n===A proof using homology===\nThe proof uses the observation that the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the ''n''-disk ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> is ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, the (''n'' \u2212 1)-[[sphere]].\n\n[[Image:Brouwer fixed point theorem retraction.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the retraction ''F'']]\nSuppose, for contradiction, that a continuous function ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup> has ''no'' fixed point. This means that, for every point x in ''D''<sup>''n''</sup>, the points ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') are distinct. Because they're distinct, for every point x in ''D''<sup>''n''</sup>, we can construct a unique ray from ''f''(''x'') to ''x'' and follow the ray until it intersects the boundary ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> (see illustration). By calling this intersection point ''F''(''x''), we define a function ''F''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> sending each point in the disk to its corresponding intersection point on the boundary.  As a special case, whenever x itself is on the boundary, then the intersection point ''F''(''x'') must be ''x''.\n\nConsequently, F is a special type of continuous function known as a [[retraction (topology)|retraction]]: every point of the [[codomain]] (in this case ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>) is a fixed point of ''F''.\n\nIntuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> onto ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, and in the case ''n'' = 1, the impossibility is more basic, because ''S''<sup>0</sup> (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval ''D''<sup>1</sup>) is not even connected. The case ''n'' = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the [[fundamental group]]s of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective [[group homomorphism]] from the fundamental group of ''S''<sup>1</sup> to that of ''D''<sup>2</sup>, but the first group is isomorphic to '''Z''' while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case ''n'' = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing [[vector field]]s.\n\nFor ''n'' > 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]]:  the homology ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''D''<sup>''n''</sup>) is trivial, while ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>) is infinite [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.\n\n===A proof using Stokes' theorem===\nTo prove that a map has fixed points, one can assume that it is smooth, because if a map has no fixed points then convolving it with a smooth function of sufficiently small support and integral equal to one produces a smooth function with no fixed points. As in the proof using homology, one is reduced to proving that there is no smooth retraction ''F'' from the ball ''B'' onto its boundary ''\u2202B''. If \u03c9 is a volume form on the boundary then by [[Stokes' Theorem]],\n:<math>0<\\int_{\\partial B}\\omega = \\int_{\\partial B}F^*(\\omega) = \\int_BdF^*(\\omega)= \\int_BF^*(d\\omega)=\\int_BF^*(0) = 0</math>\ngiving a contradiction.\n\nMore generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes' theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form \u03c9 generates the de Rham cohomology group ''H''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>(''\u2202B'') used in the cohomology proof.\n\n===A combinatorial proof===\nThe BFPT can be proved using [[Sperner's lemma]]. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which ''f'' is a function from the standard ''n''-[[simplex]], <math>\\Delta^n,</math> to itself, where\n\n:<math>\\Delta^n = \\left\\{P\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\mid\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 \\text{ and } P_i \\ge 0 \\text{ for all } i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nFor every point <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> also <math>f(P)\\in \\Delta^n.</math> Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{f(P)_i}</math>\n\nHence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> there must be an index <math>j \\in \\{0, \\ldots, n\\}</math> such that the <math>j</math>th coordinate of <math>P</math> is greater than or equal to the <math>j</math>th coordinate of its image under ''f'':\n\n:<math>P_j \\geq f(P)_j.</math>\n\nMoreover, if <math>P</math> lies on a ''k''-dimensional sub-face of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> then by the same argument, the index <math>j</math> can be selected from among the {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.\n\nWe now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring.  For every triangulation of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> the color of every vertex <math>P</math> is an index <math>j</math> such that <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j.</math>\n\nBy construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an ''n''-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} available colors.\n\nBecause ''f'' is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point <math>P</math> which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j</math> for all <math>j.</math>\n\nBecause the sum of the coordinates of <math>P</math> and <math>f(P)</math> must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:\n\n:<math>f(P) = P.</math>\n\nThat is, <math>P</math> is a fixed point of <math>f.</math>\n\n===A proof by Hirsch===\nThere is also a quick proof, by [[Morris Hirsch]], based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction.  The [[indirect proof]] starts by noting that the map ''f'' can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], for example.  One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable.  Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by [[Sard's theorem]], which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity).  Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball\u2014which is impossible in a retraction.\n\nR. Bruce Kellogg, Tien-Yien Li, and [[James A. Yorke]] turned Hirsch's proof into a [[Computability|computable]] proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points.{{sfn|Kellogg|Li|Yorke|1976}}  For almost any point, ''q'', on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from ''q'' to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from ''q'' to the fixed point so the method is essentially computable.{{sfn|Chow|Mallet-Paret|Yorke|1978}} gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.\n\n===A proof using the ''oriented area''===\nA variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard's theorem, and goes as follows. If <math>r\\colon B\\to \\partial B</math> is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation <math>g^t(x):=t\\, r(x)+(1-t)x</math>, and the smooth function\n:<math>\\varphi(t):=\\int_B \\operatorname{det} D g^t(x) dx.</math>\nDifferentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that ''{{prime|\u03c6}}''(''t'') = 0 for all ''t'', so ''\u03c6'' is a constant function, which is a contradiction because ''\u03c6''(0) is the ''n''-dimensional volume of the ball, while ''\u03c6''(1) is zero.  The geometric idea is that ''\u03c6''(''t'') is the oriented area of ''g''<sup>''t''</sup>(''B'') (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via ''g''<sup>''t''</sup>, taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter ''t'' passes form 0 to 1 the map ''g''<sup>''t''</sup> transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction ''r'', which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of ''r'' is necessarily 0, as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.\n\n===A proof using the game hex===\nA quite different proof given by [[David Gale]] is based on the game of [[Hex (board game)|Hex]].  The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw.  This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2.  By considering ''n''-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the [[determinacy]] theorem for Hex.<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818\u2013827|doi=10.2307/2320146|jstor=2320146|issue=10}}</ref>\n\n===A proof using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem===\nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map ''f'' from a finite simplicial complex ''B'' to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum_n(-1)^n\\operatorname{Tr}(f|H_n(B))</math>\nand in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then ''f'' must have a fixed point. If ''B'' is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero homology group is :<math>H_0(B)</math> and ''f'' acts as the identity on this group, so ''f'' has a fixed point.\n\n===A proof in a weak logical system===\nIn [[reverse mathematics]], Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system [[Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma|WKL<sub>0</sub>]], and conversely over the base system [[reverse mathematics|RCA<sub>0</sub>]] Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the [[weak K\u00f6nig's lemma]], so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general [[fixed-point theorem]]s.\n\nThe straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary [[Hilbert space]] instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not [[compact space|compact]]. For example, in the Hilbert space [[Lp space|\u2113<sup>2</sup>]] of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map ''f'' : \u2113<sup>2</sup> \u2192 \u2113<sup>2</sup> which sends a sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) from the closed unit ball of \u2113<sup>2</sup> to the sequence (''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) defined by\n:<math>y_0=\\sqrt{1-\\|x\\|_2^2}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad y_n=x_{n-1}\\quad\\text{ for }\\quad n\\geq 1.</math>\nIt is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of \u2113<sup>2</sup>, but does not have a fixed point.\n\nThe generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and also often an assumption of [[Convex set|convexity]]. See [[fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for a discussion of these theorems.\n\nThere is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If <math>X</math> is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function <math>f:X\\rightarrow X</math> has a fixed point,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eldon Dyer |year=1956|title=A fixed point theorem | journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society| volume=7 | pages=662\u2013672|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4|issue=4}}</ref> where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily [[Metric space|metric]]) [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] of which every [[open cover]] has a finite open refinement <math>\\{U_1,\\ldots,U_m\\}</math>, such that <math>U_i \\cap U_j \\neq \\emptyset</math> if and only if <math>|i-j| \\leq 1</math>.

The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions <math>f</math> from a closed interval <math>I</math> in the real numbers to itself or from a closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] <math>D</math> to itself.

The following examples show why the pre-conditions are important.\n\n===Boundedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = x+1,</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. The space <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is convex and closed, but not bounded.\n\n===Closedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{x+1}{2},</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from the open interval (\u22121,1) to itself. In this interval, it shifts every point to the right, so it cannot have a fixed point. The space (\u22121,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. The function ''f'' {{em|does}} have a fixed point for the closed interval [\u22121,1], namely ''f''(1) = 1.\n\n===Convexity===\nConvexity is not strictly necessary for BFPT. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under [[homeomorphism]]s, BFPT is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball <math>D^n</math>. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also [[closed set|closed]], bounded, [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected|without holes]], etc.).\n\nThe following example shows that BFPT doesn't work for domains with holes. Consider the  function <math>f(x)=-x</math>,\nwhich is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. Since ''-x\u2260x'' holds for any point of the unit circle, ''f'' has no fixed point. The analogous example works for the ''n''-dimensional sphere (or any symmetric domain that does not contain the origin). The unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex) . The function ''f'' {{em|does}} have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.\n\nA formal generalization of BFPT for \"hole-free\" domains can be derived from the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/323841 | title=Why is convexity a requirement for Brouwer fixed points? | publisher=Math StackExchange | accessdate=22 May 2015 | author=Belk, Jim}}</ref>\n\n===Notes===\nThe continuous function in this theorem is not required to be [[bijective]] or even [[surjective]].\n\n==Illustrations==\nThe theorem has several \"real world\" illustrations. Here are some examples.\n\n1. Take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the ''n'' = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it.\n\n2. Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country.  There will always be a \"You are Here\" point on the map which represents that same point in the country.\n\n3. In three dimensions a consequence of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no matter how much you stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume.  Ordering a cocktail [[shaken, not stirred]] defeats the convexity condition (\"shaking\" being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid).  In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Intuitive approach==\n\n===Explanations attributed to Brouwer===\nThe theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of coffee.<ref>The interest of this anecdote rests in its intuitive and didactic character, but its accuracy is dubious. As the history section shows, the origin of the theorem is not Brouwer's work. More than 20 years earlier [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] had proved an equivalent result, and 5 years before Brouwer P.&nbsp;Bohl had proved the three-dimensional case.</ref>\nIf one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.\nHe drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.<ref name=Arte>This citation comes originally from a television broadcast: ''[https://archive.is/20130113210953/http://archives.arte.tv/hebdo/archimed/19990921/ftext/sujet5.html Archim\u00e8de]'', [[Arte]], 21 septembre 1999</ref>\nThe fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.\nThe result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.\n\nBrouwer is said to have added: \"I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.\"<ref name=Arte />\nBrouwer \"flattens\" his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. Unlike the coffee cup example, the crumbled paper example also demonstrates that more than one fixed point may exist. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as [[Stefan Banach]]'s, that guarantee uniqueness.\n\n===One-dimensional case===\n[[File:Th\u00e9or\u00e8me-de-Brouwer-dim-1.svg|200px|right]]\nIn one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove.  The continuous function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] and takes values in the same interval.  Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] which maps ''x'' to ''x'' (light green).\n\nIntuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal.  To prove this, consider the function ''g'' which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;-&nbsp;''x''. It is \u2265&nbsp;0 on ''a'' and \u2264&nbsp;0 on&nbsp;''b''.  By the [[intermediate value theorem]], ''g'' has a [[Root of a function|zero]] in [''a'',&nbsp;''b'']; this zero is a fixed point.\n\nBrouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: \"Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.\"<ref name=Arte />\n\n==History==\nThe Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of [[algebraic topology]], and is the basis of more general [[fixed point theorem]]s which are important in [[functional analysis]]. The case ''n'' = 3 first was proved by [[Piers Bohl]] in 1904 (published in ''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'').<ref name=Bohl1904>{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Bohl |title=  \u00dcber die Bewegung eines mechanischen Systems in der N\u00e4he einer Gleichgewichtslage |journal=J.

The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on this question. In 1912 he proved the [[hairy ball theorem]] for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Hans  |last=Freudenthal |authorlink=Hans Freudenthal | title=The cradle of modern topology, according to Brouwer's inedita |journal=[[Historia Mathematica]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=495\u2013502 [p. 495] |year=1975 |doi=10.1016/0315-0860(75)90111-1 }}</ref> These two results in themselves were not really new.

A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the [[Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem]] says that a continuous map from the ''n''-dimensional sphere to '''R'''<sup>n</sup> has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem was generalized to [[Banach space]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Schauder |title=Der Fixpunktsatz in Funktionsr\u00e4umen |journal=[[Studia Mathematica]] |volume=2 |year=1930 |issue= |pages=171\u2013180 |doi= 10.4064/sm-2-1-171-180}}</ref> This generalization is known as [[Fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces|Schauder's fixed-point theorem]], a result generalized further by S.

It can be used to prove the [[Hartman-Grobman theorem]], which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria.

But Scarf's algorithm cannot be used to find a point ''x'' such that ''x'' is very close to a fixed point: we cannot guarantee <math>d(x,y) < \\varepsilon,</math> where <math>f(y)=y.</math> Often this latter condition is what is meant by the informal phrase \"approximating a fixed point\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n==Proof outlines==\n\n===A proof using degree===\nBrouwer's original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the [[degree of a continuous mapping]].  Modern accounts of the proof can also be found in the literature.<ref>{{citation | last = Teschl| first = Gerald| authorlink = Gerald Teschl| title = Topics in Real and Functional Analysis| chapter-url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-fa/index.html|chapter=14.4: The Brouwer fixed point theorem|year=2005|accessdate=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>K=\\overline{B(0)}</math> denote the closed unit ball in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> centered at the origin.  Suppose for simplicitly that <math>f:K\\to K</math> is continuously differentiable.  A [[regular value]] of <math>f</math> is a point <math>p\\in B(0)</math> such that the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of <math>f</math> is non-singular at every point of the preimage of <math>p</math>.  In particular, by the [[inverse function theorem]], every point of the preimage of <math>f</math> lies in <math>B(0)</math> (the interior of <math>K</math>).  The degree of <math>f</math> at a regular value <math>p\\in B(0)</math> is defined as the sum of the signs of the [[Jacobian determinant]] of <math>f</math> over the preimages of <math>p</math> under <math>f</math>:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{deg}_p(f) = \\sum_{x\\in f^{-1}(p)} \\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\det(Df(x))\\right).</math>\n\nThe degree is, roughly speaking, the number of \"sheets\" of the preimage ''f'' lying over a small open set around ''p'', with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented.  This is thus a generalization of [[winding number]] to higher dimensions.\n\nThe degree satisfies the property of ''homotopy invariance'': let <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> be two continuously differentiable functions, and <math>H_t(x)=tf+(1-t)g</math> for <math>0\\le t\\le 1</math>.  Suppose that the point <math>p</math> is a regular value of <math>H_t</math> for all ''t''.  Then <math>\\deg_p f = \\deg_p g</math>.\n\nIf there is no fixed point of the boundary of <math>K</math>, then the function \n:<math>g(x)=\\frac{x-f(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-f(x)\\right|}</math>\n\nis well-defined, and \n\n<math>H(t,x) = \\frac{x-tf(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-tf(x)\\right|}</math>\n\ndefines a homotopy from the identity function to it.  The identity function has degree one at every point.  In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so <math>g</math> also has degree one at the origin.  As a consequence, the preimage <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> is not empty.  The elements of <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> are precisely the fixed points of the original function ''f''.\n\nThis requires some work to make fully general.  The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of ''f'', and then to continuous functions.  The more modern advent of [[homology theory]] simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.\n\n===A proof using homology===\nThe proof uses the observation that the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the ''n''-disk ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> is ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, the (''n'' \u2212 1)-[[sphere]].\n\n[[Image:Brouwer fixed point theorem retraction.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the retraction ''F'']]\nSuppose, for contradiction, that a continuous function ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup> has ''no'' fixed point. This means that, for every point x in ''D''<sup>''n''</sup>, the points ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') are distinct. Because they're distinct, for every point x in ''D''<sup>''n''</sup>, we can construct a unique ray from ''f''(''x'') to ''x'' and follow the ray until it intersects the boundary ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> (see illustration). By calling this intersection point ''F''(''x''), we define a function ''F''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> sending each point in the disk to its corresponding intersection point on the boundary.  As a special case, whenever x itself is on the boundary, then the intersection point ''F''(''x'') must be ''x''.\n\nConsequently, F is a special type of continuous function known as a [[retract]]ion: every point of the [[codomain]] (in this case ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>) is a fixed point of ''F''.\n\nIntuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> onto ''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, and in the case ''n'' = 1, the impossibility is more basic, because ''S''<sup>0</sup> (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval ''D''<sup>1</sup>) is not even connected. The case ''n'' = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the [[fundamental group]]s of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective [[group homomorphism]] from the fundamental group of ''S''<sup>1</sup> to that of ''D''<sup>2</sup>, but the first group is isomorphic to '''Z''' while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case ''n'' = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing [[vector field]]s.\n\nFor ''n'' > 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]]:  the homology ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''D''<sup>''n''</sup>) is trivial, while ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''S''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>) is infinite [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.\n\n===A proof using Stokes' theorem===\nTo prove that a map has fixed points, one can assume that it is smooth, because if a map has no fixed points then convolving it with a smooth function of sufficiently small support and integral equal to one produces a smooth function with no fixed points. As in the proof using homology, one is reduced to proving that there is no smooth retraction ''F'' from the ball ''B'' onto its boundary ''\u2202B''. If \u03c9 is a volume form on the boundary then by [[Stokes' Theorem]],\n:<math>0<\\int_{\\partial B}\\omega = \\int_{\\partial B}F^*(\\omega) = \\int_BdF^*(\\omega)= \\int_BF^*(d\\omega)=\\int_BF^*(0) = 0</math>\ngiving a contradiction.\n\nMore generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes' theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form \u03c9 generates the de Rham cohomology group ''H''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>(''\u2202B'') used in the cohomology proof.\n\n===A combinatorial proof===\nThe BFPT can be proved using [[Sperner's lemma]]. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which ''f'' is a function from the standard ''n''-[[simplex]], <math>\\Delta^n,</math> to itself, where\n\n:<math>\\Delta^n = \\left\\{P\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\mid\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 \\text{ and } P_i \\ge 0 \\text{ for all } i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nFor every point <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> also <math>f(P)\\in \\Delta^n.</math> Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{f(P)_i}</math>\n\nHence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> there must be an index <math>j \\in \\{0, \\ldots, n\\}</math> such that the <math>j</math>th coordinate of <math>P</math> is greater than or equal to the <math>j</math>th coordinate of its image under ''f'':\n\n:<math>P_j \\geq f(P)_j.</math>\n\nMoreover, if <math>P</math> lies on a ''k''-dimensional sub-face of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> then by the same argument, the index <math>j</math> can be selected from among the {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.\n\nWe now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring.  For every triangulation of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> the color of every vertex <math>P</math> is an index <math>j</math> such that <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j.</math>\n\nBy construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an ''n''-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} available colors.\n\nBecause ''f'' is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point <math>P</math> which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j</math> for all <math>j.</math>\n\nBecause the sum of the coordinates of <math>P</math> and <math>f(P)</math> must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:\n\n:<math>f(P) = P.</math>\n\nThat is, <math>P</math> is a fixed point of <math>f.</math>\n\n===A proof by Hirsch===\nThere is also a quick proof, by [[Morris Hirsch]], based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction.  The [[indirect proof]] starts by noting that the map ''f'' can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], for example.  One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable.  Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by [[Sard's theorem]], which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity).  Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball\u2014which is impossible in a retraction.\n\nR. Bruce Kellogg, Tien-Yien Li, and [[James A. Yorke]] turned Hirsch's proof into a [[Computability|computable]] proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points.{{sfn|Kellogg|Li|Yorke|1976}}  For almost any point, ''q'', on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from ''q'' to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from ''q'' to the fixed point so the method is essentially computable.{{sfn|Chow|Mallet-Paret|Yorke|1978}} gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.\n\n===A proof using the ''oriented area''===\nA variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard's theorem, and goes as follows. If <math>r\\colon B\\to \\partial B</math> is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation <math>g^t(x):=t\\, r(x)+(1-t)x</math>, and the smooth function\n:<math>\\varphi(t):=\\int_B \\operatorname{det} D g^t(x) dx.</math>\nDifferentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that ''{{prime|\u03c6}}''(''t'') = 0 for all ''t'', so ''\u03c6'' is a constant function, which is a contradiction because ''\u03c6''(0) is the ''n''-dimensional volume of the ball, while ''\u03c6''(1) is zero.  The geometric idea is that ''\u03c6''(''t'') is the oriented area of ''g''<sup>''t''</sup>(''B'') (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via ''g''<sup>''t''</sup>, taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter ''t'' passes form 0 to 1 the map ''g''<sup>''t''</sup> transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction ''r'', which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of ''r'' is necessarily 0, as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.\n\n===A proof using the game hex===\nA quite different proof given by [[David Gale]] is based on the game of [[Hex (board game)|Hex]].  The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw.  This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2.  By considering ''n''-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the [[determinacy]] theorem for Hex.<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818\u2013827|doi=10.2307/2320146|jstor=2320146|issue=10}}</ref>\n\n===A proof using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem===\nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map ''f'' from a finite simplicial complex ''B'' to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum_n(-1)^n\\operatorname{Tr}(f|H_n(B))</math>\nand in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then ''f'' must have a fixed point. If ''B'' is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero homology group is :<math>H_0(B)</math> and ''f'' acts as the identity on this group, so ''f'' has a fixed point.\n\n===A proof in a weak logical system===\nIn [[reverse mathematics]], Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system [[Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma|WKL<sub>0</sub>]], and conversely over the base system [[reverse mathematics|RCA<sub>0</sub>]] Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the [[weak K\u00f6nig's lemma]], so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general [[fixed-point theorem]]s.\n\nThe straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary [[Hilbert space]] instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not [[compact space|compact]]. For example, in the Hilbert space [[Lp space|\u2113<sup>2</sup>]] of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map ''f'' : \u2113<sup>2</sup> \u2192 \u2113<sup>2</sup> which sends a sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) from the closed unit ball of \u2113<sup>2</sup> to the sequence (''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) defined by\n:<math>y_0=\\sqrt{1-\\|x\\|_2^2}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad y_n=x_{n-1}\\quad\\text{ for }\\quad n\\geq 1.</math>\nIt is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of \u2113<sup>2</sup>, but does not have a fixed point.\n\nThe generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and also often an assumption of [[Convex set|convexity]]. See [[fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for a discussion of these theorems.\n\nThere is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If <math>X</math> is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function <math>f:X\\rightarrow X</math> has a fixed point,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eldon Dyer |year=1956|title=A fixed point theorem | journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society| volume=7 | pages=662\u2013672|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4|issue=4}}</ref> where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily [[Metric space|metric]]) [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] of which every [[open cover]] has a finite open refinement <math>\\{U_1,\\ldots,U_m\\}</math>, such that <math>U_i \\cap U_j \\neq \\emptyset</math> if and only if <math>|i-j| \\leq 1</math>. Examples of chainable continua include compact connected linearly ordered spaces and in particular closed intervals of real numbers.\n\nThe [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]] generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a different direction: it stays in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, but considers upper [[hemi-continuous]] [[set-valued function]]s (functions that assign to each point of the set a subset of the set). It also requires compactness and convexity of the set.\n\nThe [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] applies to (almost) arbitrary compact topological spaces, and gives a condition in terms of [[singular homology]] that guarantees the existence of fixed points; this condition is trivially satisfied for any map in the case of ''D''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n== Equivalent results ==\n{{Analogous fixed-point theorems}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Banach fixed-point theorem]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n* [[Nash equilibrium#Alternate proof using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem|Nash equilibrium]]\n* [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Miranda theorem]] \u2013 equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem\n* [[Topological combinatorics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |first=Shui Nee |last=Chow |first2=John |last2=Mallet-Paret |first3=James A. |last3=Yorke |author3-link=James A.
