He had first met Costello\u2014who came from [[Coatbridge]], [[Lanarkshire]]{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=88}}\u2014at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=28}} Costello was pregnant by an [[Asian people|Asian]] bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from [[Glasgow]] to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed race child.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=61}} She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=59}} The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver. Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963;{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=61}} to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a [[miscarriage]] and that Charmaine was adopted.

When Rena discovered her husband's [[infidelity]], she began an affair with a man named John McLachlan. On one occasion, Fred discovered the pair in an embrace. He punched Rena, making her scream. In response, McLachlan punched Fred, who drew a knife and grazed McLachlan's stomach. When punched by McLachlan a second time, Fred stopped defending himself. Years later, McLachlan recollected this incident: \"He couldn't tackle a man, but he wasn't so slow in attacking women.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=66}} He and Rena continued their affair, and McLachlan became increasingly aghast at Rena's bruises and black eyes. On each occasion it became apparent Fred had beaten his wife, McLachlan extensively beat Fred.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/> Another time, McLachlan witnessed Charmaine\u2014little older than a toddler\u2014ask Fred for an ice cream from his van; in response, Fred struck her across the head, triggering another beating from McLachlan.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/>\n\nOn 4 November 1965, Fred accidentally ran over and killed a small boy in Glasgow with his van.{{sfn|Sounes|1995}} Fred was cleared of any wrongdoing by police,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=68}} but feared the hostile reaction and potential reprisals for the accident from the locals, whom he relied upon to make his living. In December, he returned to Gloucester with Charmaine and Anna Marie, renting a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park in [[Bishop's Cleeve]]. Rena joined him in February 1966,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=98}} accompanied by Isa McNeill and Anne McFall, who also moved into Fred's caravan. (McNeill and McFall both came from impoverished backgrounds; both hoped to find work in England.){{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=69}} Shortly after the move south, Fred found employment driving a lorry for a local [[abattoir]].\n\nBy early 1966, Fred had begun to exhibit [[Abusive power and control|dominance and control]] over all three women. He was also prone to violent mood swings, and Rena and McNeill typically bore the brunt of his fury; Fred also physically attacked his stepdaughter more than once. He is also reported to have begun [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] Charmaine,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13 }} and to have encouraged Rena to turn to [[prostitution]] to supplement his meagre income.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996||page=12 }}\n\nTo escape Fred's [[domestic abuse]] and increasingly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] sexual demands, Rena phoned McLachlan, begging him to rescue her, McNeill and her children. Together, McLachlan, Rena, and McNeill devised a plan; he and McNeill's boyfriend, John Trotter,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=97}} would secretly drive to Bishop's Cleeve in McLachlan's [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967|Mini]] and discreetly take Rena, her children and McNeill back to Scotland.<ref name=\"Life and Death of a Good Mother\"/> McFall had by this stage become infatuated with Fred, who had promised to marry her. It is likely she informed Fred of the plan,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=71}} as he arrived at the meeting time, and McFall was \"oddly calm\" as she informed McNeill she intended to remain with Fred to work as the children's nanny. An altercation ensued between Fred and McLachlan, resulting in Fred being struck several times as he clutched onto Charmaine and Anna Marie. Police were called and McLachlan, Trotter, McNeill, and Rena left, with Fred threatening to kill Rena should he ever see her again.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=71}}\n\nTo ensure her daughters' well-being, Rena frequently travelled to England to visit Charmaine and Anna Marie while they lived with Fred at Bishop's Cleeve.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13}} Despite initially maintaining her friendship with McFall, Rena soon began to resent her matriarchal presence around her daughters. On 11 October,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=19}} in an act of resentment, Rena stole some belongings from Fred's caravan and returned to Glasgow. She was arrested the following month and returned to Gloucester to face trial. On 29 November, Rena was sentenced to three years' [[probation]]. Fred testified at the hearing, admitting he and McFall were living together, but falsely claiming McFall intended to return to Scotland imminently.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=74}}\n\nAfter the trial, McFall moved into a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park; Rena alternated between living with Fred and returning to Glasgow. Letters McFall posted to her family and McNeill in Glasgow between 1966 and 1967 indicate she believed a relationship with Fred could offer her a better life than that she had experienced in Scotland,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=72}} and she tried to persuade Fred to divorce his wife in order that he could marry her.\n\n===Murder of Anne McFall===\nIn July 1967,{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=72}} McFall, aged 18 and eight months pregnant with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her [[dismemberment|dismembered]] remains were found buried at the edge of a cornfield between Much Marcle and [[Kempley]] in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully [[disarticulation|disarticulated]], and many [[phalanx bone|phalange bones]] were missing from her body\u2014likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=207}} Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=76}}\n\nThe following month, Rena returned to live with Fred, and the couple relocated to the Lake House Caravan Park. Their relationship initially improved, but Rena left the following year, again leaving the children in his care. On these occasions when Fred had no woman to supervise and care for the girls, he temporarily placed them in the [[Child care#Common types|care]] of Gloucester [[social services]].{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=92}} hi\n\n==Rosemary Letts==\nFred first encountered Rosemary Letts in early 1969, shortly after her 15th birthday.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=106\u2013107}} The pair first met at [[Cheltenham]] bus station. Initially, Rose was repulsed by Fred's unkempt appearance, and deduced he was a tramp, but she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred, but allowed him to accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly [[promiscuity|promiscuous]]. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=88}}\n\nHaving discovered Rose worked in a nearby bread shop, a few days after their first encounter, Fred persuaded an unknown woman to enter the premises and present her with a gift accompanied by the explanation that a \"man outside\" had asked her to present this gift to her.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=113}} Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening; an offer she accepted.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=87}} Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the Lake House Caravan Park, and a willing childminder to Charmaine and Anna Marie, whom she noted were [[Child neglect|neglected]] and whom she initially treated with care and affection. On several occasions in the early days of their courtship, Rose insisted she and Fred take the girls on excursions to gather wild flowers.\n\nWithin weeks of her first meeting Fred, Rose left her job at the bread shop in order to become the nanny to Charmaine and Anna Marie; this decision was made with the agreement that Fred would provide her with sufficient money to give to her parents on Fridays to convince them she was still obtaining a salary at the bread shop.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=119}} Several months later, Rose introduced Fred to her family, who were aghast at their daughter's choice of partner. Rose's mother, Daisy Letts, was unimpressed with Fred's braggadocio, and correctly concluded he was a [[pathological lying|pathological liar]]; her father, Bill Letts\u2014a diagnosed [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] who is believed to have molested his daughter\u2014vehemently disapproved of the relationship, threatening Fred directly and promising to call social services if he continued to date his daughter.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=120}}\n\n===Relationship===\nRose's parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was dating an older man, and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at his caravan.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=15 }} In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=96}} and only allowed to leave under controlled conditions. When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=96}}\n\nOn her 16th birthday, Rose left the home for troubled teenagers to return to her parents (Fred at the time serving a 30-day sentence for theft and unpaid fines). Upon Fred's release, Rose left her parents' home to move into the Cheltenham flat Fred then lived in. Shortly thereafter, Fred collected Charmaine and Anna Marie from social services. Bill Letts made one final effort to prevent his daughter from seeing Fred, and Rose was examined by a police surgeon in February 1970, who confirmed she was pregnant. In response, Rose was again placed into care, but was discharged on 6 March on the understanding she would terminate her pregnancy and return to her family. Instead, Rose opted to live with Fred, resulting in her father forbidding his daughter from ever again setting foot in his household.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=99}}\n\nThree months later, the couple vacated the Cheltenham flat and relocated to the ground floor flat of a two-storey house in Midland Road, Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (speculation remains that Heather may have been sired by Rose's own father).{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} Two months later, Fred was imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle [[Vehicle licence#United Kingdom|tax disc]]. He remained imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with Charmaine and Anna Marie being told to refer to Rose as their mother.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=123}}\n\nAccording to Anna Marie West, she and Charmaine were frequently subjected to criticism, beatings, and other forms of punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose's care at Midland Road, but although Anna Marie was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in response to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was physically punished. Despite the years of neglect and abuse, Charmaine's spirit had not been broken,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=91}} and she talked wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held that her \"mummy will come and save me\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=105}} Anna Marie later recollected her sister repeatedly antagonised Rose by making statements such as: \"My real mummy wouldn't swear or shout at us\" in response to Rose's scathing language.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=67}} A childhood friend of Charmaine's named Tracey Giles, who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road, would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests' flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Giles, Charmaine had been \"calm and unconcerned\", while Anna Marie had been standing by the door with a blank expression on her face.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=134}}\n\nHospital records reveal Charmaine had received treatment for a severe [[penetrating trauma|puncture wound]] to her left ankle in the [[Emergency department|casualty unit]] of the [[Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|Gloucester Royal Hospital]] on 28 March 1971. This incident was explained by Rose to have resulted from a household accident.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=138}}\n\n===Murder of Charmaine West===\nRose is believed to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred's prison release date of 24 June 1971. She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June. It is believed to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered. As well as [[forensic science|forensic]] [[dentistry|odontology]] confirmation that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Giles' mother, Shirley, [[corroborating evidence|corroborated]] the fact that Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June. In her later testimony at Rose's trial, Shirley Giles stated she and her family had lived in the upper flat of 25 Midland Road in 1971, and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie. Shirley Giles stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: \"She's gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!\"<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\" /> before Tracey began to weep.\n\nAs with the Giles family, Rose explained Charmaine's disappearance to others who enquired about her whereabouts by claiming that Rena had called and taken her eldest daughter to live with her in [[Bristol]]; she informed staff at Charmaine's primary school that the child had moved with her mother to [[London]].{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=146}} When Fred was released from prison on 24 June, he allayed Anna Marie's concerns for her sister's whereabouts by claiming her mother had collected Charmaine and returned to Scotland. In her autobiography, ''Out of the Shadows'', Anna Marie recollected that when she asked why her mother had collected Charmaine but not her, Fred callously replied: \"She wouldn't want you, love. You're the wrong colour.\"{{sfn|West|1995|page=59}}\n\nCharmaine's body was initially stowed in the coal cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He later buried her naked body in the yard close to the back door of the flat, and he remained adamant he had not dismembered her. A subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip; this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976. Several bones\u2014particularly [[patellae]], finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones\u2014were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this proved to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=114}}\n\n===Murder of Catherine \"Rena\" West===\nRena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated. She is also known to have visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children's whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=114}} Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and extremely anxious about her children's welfare. Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him\u2014likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the final time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by [[strangulation]], possibly in the back seat of Fred's [[Ford Popular#Ford Popular 100E|Ford Popular]] and likely while intoxicated.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=121}} When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a [[sexual assault]] prior to her murder. Rena's body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at Letterbox Field.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=14 }}\n\n==Marriage to Letts==\nOn 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary married. The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself as a [[bachelor]] upon the marriage certificate. No family or friends were invited.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=124}} Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street. Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for \u00a37,000.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=265}} To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms were initially converted into [[bedsit]]s, to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only he and his family were permitted access to the garden of the property. On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter. The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=158}}\n\n===Prostitution===\nShortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at their residence and advertising her services in a local [[classified magazine#contact magazines|contact magazine]]. Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester's [[West Indies|West Indian]]{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=220}} community through these advertisements. In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in [[casual sex]] with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28 }} When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner with acts such as partially suffocating her partner, or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner's body. If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: \"Aren't you woman enough to take it?\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=209}}\n\nTo many of these women, it became apparent Rose and her husband (who regularly participated in [[threesome]]s with his wife and her lovers) took a particular pleasure from seeking to take women beyond their sexual limits\u2014typically via sessions involving [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], as the Wests openly admitted to taking a particular pleasure from any form of sex involving a strong measure of dominance, pain and violence. To cater to these [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]], they amassed a large collection of bondage and restraining devices, magazines and photographs\u2014later expanding this collection to include videos depicting bestiality and graphic [[child sexual abuse]].{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=30 }}\n\nRose controlled the West family finances, Fred giving her his pay packets.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=273}} The room Rose used for prostitution was known throughout the West household as \"Rose's Room\", and had several hidden peepholes allowing Fred\u2014a longtime [[voyeur]]\u2014to watch her entertain her clients. He also installed a [[baby monitor]] in the room, allowing him to listen from elsewhere in the house. The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose was not to be disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room around her neck,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=202}} and Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which Rose's clients were instructed to ring whenever they visited the household. Much of the money earned from Rose's prostitution was spent on home improvements.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=222}}{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=29}}\n\nBy 1977, Rose's father had come to tolerate his daughter's marriage, and to develop a grudging respect for Fred. Together, he and Fred opened a caf\u00e9 they named The Green Lantern, which was soon insolvent. When Bill Letts discovered Rose's prostitution, he would also visit to have sex with his daughter.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,1148300,00.html \"Euan Ferguson on the Legacy of Fred West\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 February 2004</ref> By 1983, she had given birth to eight children, at least three of whom were conceived by clients. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own, and falsely informed them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his great-grandmother was a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/'Men+just+can't+handle+the+fact+that+Fredand+Rose+West+are+my+mum+and...-a061392718 |title=Men Just Can't Handle the Fact that Fred and Rose West are my Mum and Dad|publisher=thefreelibrary.com |date=4 September 2000 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nWhen each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment\u2014almost always physical\u2014being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. The children feared being the recipients of violence from their parents, the vast majority inflicted by Rose, occasionally by Fred. The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose's gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults. Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), ran away from home; both returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends, and both were beaten when they returned home.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=194}} Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency]] department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=344}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/more-questions-than-answers-1583744.html|title=More Questions than Answers|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=18 December 2016 |first1=Tanya |last1=Sillem |first2=Paul |last2=Wandless |date=26 November 1995}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion, as Stephen was mopping the kitchen floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using. In response, Rose hit the boy over the head with the bowl, then repeatedly kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: \"You did that on purpose, you little swine!\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=67}} On another occasion, Rose became furious about a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae screamed, \"No, Mum! No, Mum!\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=69}} as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing.\n\nEven Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in August 1974,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=154-155}} Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand; Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose lunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and three of Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: \"Look what you done, fella. You've got to take me to the hospital now.\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=201}}\n\n==Initial sexual assaults==\n\n===Anna Marie West===\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was ordered to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=70}} She was then stripped naked, bound to a mattress and gagged before Fred [[rape]]d her{{sfn|Wansell|1996}} with Rose's active encouragement. After the rape, Rose explained to the child: \"Everybody does it to every girl. It's a father's job. Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=71}} Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/fred-west-17169706#crimes |title=Freed West Biography |publisher=biography.com |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nRose occasionally sexually abused Anna Marie herself, and later took extreme gratification in degrading her with acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=170}} From the age of 13, Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Rose was always present in the room when these acts occurred,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=170}} to ensure Anna Marie did not reveal her true age.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=178}} On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged 13 or 14, Rose took her to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of [[barley wine]]. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once they had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked her: \"Do you think you could be my friend?\" before she was sexually abused by her father and stepmother.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=214\u2013215}}\n\n===Caroline Owens===\nIn October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children's nanny. They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from [[Tewkesbury]] to her [[Cinderford]] home, having visited her boyfriend. Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, the Wests offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday. Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street, sharing a room with Anna Marie, whom Owens noted was \"very withdrawn\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=133}}\n\nRose, who had begun to engage in prostitution by this time, explained to Owens that she worked as a [[massage|masseuse]] when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her.<ref name=\"CRHH\">{{YouTube|aYp5gKhqJK4|Fred and Rose West- The House of Horrors 3/4}}</ref> According to Owens, Fred also said he was a skilled [[abortion]]ist, who was available should she ever need such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests' overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.{{sfn|Roberts|2005}}\n\nKnowing Owens' habits of hitchhiking along the [[A40 road|A40]] between Cinderford and Tewkesbury, the Wests formulated a plan to abduct her for their shared gratification. Fred later admitted that the specific intent of this abduction was the rape and likely murder of Owens, but that his initial incentive was to determine whether his wife would be willing to at least assist him in an abduction.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=134}} On 6 December 1972, the couple lured Owens into their vehicle with an apology for their conduct and the offer of a lift home.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> Initially, Owens believed the Wests had been sincere in their apologies to her and obliged, believing she had simply mistaken their earlier intentions. Rose joined her in the back seat, with the explanation she wanted a \"girls' chat\" as Fred drove.\n\nShortly thereafter, Rose began to fondle her, as Fred questioned whether she had had sex with her boyfriend that evening.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=135}} When Owens began to protest, Fred stopped the car, referred to Owens as a \"bitch\", and punched her into [[unconsciousness]] before he and Rose bound and gagged her with a scarf and duct tape.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28}} In her subsequent statement to police, Owens stated that, at Cromwell Street, she was given a drugged cup of tea to drink, then again gagged and subjected to a prolonged sexual assault from Fred and Rose. At one stage, Fred remarked that Owens' [[clitoris]] was unusual<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> then lashed her genitals with a leather belt. When Owens screamed, Rose again smothered her with a pillow and further restrained her about the neck, and performed [[cunnilingus]] on her. Quickly realising the gravity of her situation, Owens ceased resisting their sexual assaults.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/>\n\nThe following morning, having noted Owens' screaming when one of his children had knocked on the door of the room in which she was restrained, Fred threatened that he and his wife would keep her locked up in the cellar and allow his \"black friends\" to abuse her, and that when they had finished, he would bury her body beneath \"the paving stones of Gloucester\".<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> Fred then claimed he had killed hundreds of young girls,<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> adding that Owens had primarily been brought to the house for \"Rose's pleasure\". He and Rose then calmly asked Owens whether she would consider returning to work as their nanny. Seeing her escape avenue, Owens agreed, and vacuumed the house to indicate her belief in becoming an extended member of the family. Later that day, Owens escaped from a [[launderette]] she and Rose had entered and returned home. Although initially too ashamed to divulge to her mother what had happened, when her mother noted the welts, bruises and exposed [[subcutaneous tissues]] on her daughter's body, Owens burst into tears and confided what had happened.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=39}}\n\nOwens' mother immediately reported her daughter's ordeal to the police, and the Wests were arrested and charged with [[assault]], [[Indecent assault#England and Wales|indecent assault]], [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]], and rape. The case was tried at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 12 January 1973, but by this date, Owens had decided she could not face the ordeal of testifying in court. All charges pertaining to her sexual abuse were dropped, and the Wests agreed to [[guilt (law)|plead guilty]] to the reduced charges of indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm; each was fined \u00a350, and the couple were allowed to walk free from court.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3509899.stm | title = Surviving Fred and Rose | date = 24 February 2004 | accessdate =1 June 2008 |work=BBC News }}</ref> When Owens heard this news, she attempted suicide.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28}}\n\n==Murders==\nThree months after the Wests' assault trial, the couple committed their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into their home on Cromwell Street. On or about 20 April,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=159}} other tenants were told that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was repeated to Gough's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire about her whereabouts (Rose had been wearing Lynda's clothing when she repeated this claim).\n\nWhen Gough's dismembered body was found, the jaw was completely wrapped in adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] to allow breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Gough had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred later admitted he had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims' bodies, and likely died of either strangulation or suffocation.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=65}} Her dismembered body, missing five [[cervical vertebrae]], the patellae and numerous phalange bones, was buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=71}}\n\nFrom their later investigations, police and [[forensic science|forensic experts]] concluded all the victims found in the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street had been murdered in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=29}} Five victims were murdered and buried in the cellar at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children's Home in [[Worcester]], and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She had been waiting for a bus in [[Warndon]] when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred's car,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=163}} where her face was bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests' address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper died from strangulation or asphyxiation, before her body was dismembered and buried in a shallow, [[cube|cubical]] grave in the cellar.\n\nOver the following 17 months, four further victims between the ages of 15 and 21 suffered a similar fate to that endured by Gough and Cooper, although the disarticulation conducted upon each successive victim, plus the [[paraphernalia]] discovered in each shallow grave, suggests each victim was likely subjected to greater abuse and torture than those previously murdered.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=156}}\n\nFollowing the murder of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted over the floor of the entire cellar. He later converted this section of the household into a bedroom for his oldest children,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=201}} and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred\u2014either with or without Rose's participation but certainly with her knowledge{{sfn|Wilson|1998|pages=184\u2013186}}\u2014murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had taken lodgings with the Wests in April 1977, and was heavily pregnant at the time of her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=179}} Although Rose\u2014herself pregnant at the time\u2014initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband's;{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=294}} she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal of a threat to the stability of the Wests' relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street. It was extensively dismembered, but no restraining devices were found with these remains, making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=175}} The unborn baby had been removed and had several bones missing. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for [[Maternity Allowance|maternity benefit]] in Shirley's name with Gloucester social services.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=185}} As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who asked about Robinson's whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/step-daughter-charmaine-was-first-to-die-1583071.html|title=Step-daughter Charmaine was first to die|access-date=17 November 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=22 November 1995}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|Several weeks after the murder of Shirley Robinson, Fred and Rose informed other lodgers they had received news Robinson had given birth to a baby boy in West Germany, and that she had named her child Barry.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=179}}}}\n\nThe final murder Fred and Rose are known to have committed with a definite sexual motive occurred on 5 August 1979. The victim was a 16-year-old named Alison Chambers, who had run away from a local children's home to become the Wests' live-in nanny in the middle of 1979. Chambers is believed to have lived within their household for several weeks before her murder, and Rose promised Chambers she could live at a rural \"peaceful farm\" she claimed she and Fred owned.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=183-184}} Her body was also buried in the garden of Cromwell Street, close to the bathroom wall, and although Chambers was likely dismembered,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=247}} her skeleton was not marked by striations as the earlier victims' bodies had been. In an effort to allay any concerns from Chambers' family (with whom she maintained regular correspondence), Fred and Rose later posted a letter written by Chambers to her mother prior to her murder from a [[Northamptonshire]] post box.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=194}}\n\n===Abuse===\n[[File:WestFamilyBasementCromwellStreet14Jan1984.jpg|thumb|The West family, pictured in their Cromwell Street home on the date of Anna Marie West's January 1984 marriage. Heather, aged 13 is at the extreme right]]\nHeather and Mae West became the focus of Fred's incestuous{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home in 1979{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=187}} after enduring a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an [[ectopic pregnancy]].{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=234}} The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls reached [[puberty]]. Fred was overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: \"I made you; I can do what I like with you.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=191}} He further referred to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him. As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped. Both girls also developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door. Stephen was also informed by his father that he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (in the event, his parents evicted him from their home when he was 16).{{sfn|Wilson|1998|pages=204\u2013205}}\n\nAlthough the girls were repulsed by their father's behaviour, Mae\u2014having once endured Fred's throwing a vacuum cleaner at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her\u2014developed a [[Defence mechanisms|mechanism]] whereby she would tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her, then jokingly brush aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=205}} whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather \"was affected quite badly by all of this. [Even] more than me.\"{{sfn|West|West|1995|page=79}} A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather had been forced to engage in intercourse with her father,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=6 }} as by the mid-1980s, she developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled;{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=235}} drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through the corner of her eye wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=172}} This distressful behaviour led to Fred and Rose suspecting Heather had [[lesbian]] inclinations, and also resulted in her becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was \"ugly\" and a \"bitch\". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=234}}\n\nHeather also expressed to Mae and Stephen her desire to run away from home and live a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle in the [[Forest of Dean]], and to never again see any human beings.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=236}}\n\n==Murder of Heather West==\nHeather did complain to friends about the abuse she and her siblings endured, and her external signs of [[mental distress|psychological distress]] were noted by several of them. Staff at the [[Hucclecote]] Secondary School, which Heather and her siblings attended, are also known to have expressed concern as to why Heather\u2014a studious and obedient pupil\u2014refused to obey orders either to change her clothing for, or shower after, sporting activities. On one occasion, she was forced to take a shower, resulting in her peers and staff noting her arms, legs and torso were covered in welts and bruises in various stages of healing.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=190}} Heather attempted to excuse these injuries as having been obtained in fights with her siblings, but confided in one close friend that they had been inflicted by her parents, adding that her mother considered her a \"little bitch\" who deserved her beatings.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=196}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose's sex life had reached several of the children's classmates, and although the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather confided to her friends that many of these rumours were true. The father of one of these classmates was a friend of the Wests; as such, word soon reached Fred and Rose that Heather had divulged details of her home life\u2014including details of her mother's promiscuity\u2014to her classmates. Fred was so concerned by these revelations that he began to escort Heather to and from school.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=194}}\n\nAfter Heather left school in 1986, she applied for numerous jobs in an effort to leave Cromwell Street. By June of the following year, she had pinned her hopes on escaping the household via obtaining a job as a [[chalet]] cleaner at a holiday camp in the seaside town of [[Torquay]]; she received notification that this application had been unsuccessful on 18 June. In response, she crumpled into tears before her siblings Mae and Stephen. That same evening, her whole family heard Heather sobbing aloud as she attempted to sleep,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=197}} and according to Mae, she \"cried all the way through the night.\" The following morning, on 19 June,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=206}} Heather was \"back to her usual self, looking miserable, biting her nails and sitting on the couch bouncing back and forth as she sat\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} as her siblings left the house to go to school.\n\nWhen Heather's siblings returned home, they were informed Heather had left to accept the job she had previously been refused in Torquay, although Rose told an enquiring neighbour that she and Heather had had a \"hell of a row\", and that Heather had run away from home. Later, to answer their children's questions about why Heather failed to contact or visit her siblings, the parents claimed that Heather had eloped with a lesbian lover. When Mae and Stephen suggested they report Heather's disappearance to police, Fred changed his story yet again, saying it would be unwise to initiate a search for Heather as she was involved in [[credit card fraud]].{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=487}} On more than one occasion, Fred and Rose persuaded an unknown acquaintance to fake a phone call from Heather to her parents.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=240\u2013241}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I mean Heather, I mean I thought the bloody world of Heather.

With Rose's approval, he later constructed a barbecue pit immediately opposite where Heather had been buried, and placed a pine table on her grave for the children of the family to sit upon whenever the Wests held family gatherings in their garden.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=235}}\n\nHeather's disappearance, Fred and Rose's constantly changing stories about their daughter's whereabouts, plus their allusions to foul play, ultimately led to police enquiries as to Heather's whereabouts. These enquiries culminated in a [[Search warrant#United Kingdom|search warrant]] being issued to excavate the Wests' garden in February 1994.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=227}}\n\n==Arrest==\nIn May 1992, Fred asked his 13-year-old daughter Louise to bring some bottles to a room on the first floor of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, \"No, don't!\" Later, Fred returned downstairs. Louise was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and [[sodomy|sodomised]] her, at one stage partially strangling her.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=18 }} When Rose returned home, Louise confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred; Rose replied, \"Oh well. You were asking for it.\" Over the following weeks, Louise was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, \"Well, what did you expect?\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=244}} Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, Louise garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend told her own mother what had happened on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.\n\nOn 6 August 1992, the police searched the West household on the pretext of searching for stolen property. Although numerous objects of sexual paraphernalia\u2014including 99 pornographic videos of both home-made and commercial nature\u2014were discovered, police did not find the video depicting the rape of Fred's daughter. The 13-year-old made a full statement through a specially-trained [[solicitor#England and Wales|solicitor]], describing her father's actions, the fact the sexual abuse had begun when she was 11, and that her mother had been casually indifferent to her plight. All the children in the household were placed in [[foster care]] the following day.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=19}} Medical examinations revealed evidence of physical and sexual abuse.{{refn|group=n|Journalist and author [[Howard Sounes]] has also claimed the younger West children were \"afflicted with [[Speech disorder|speech impediment]]s and [[Strabismus|squints]].\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=344}}}}\n\nThe West children also divulged their mother had inflicted most of the physical abuse and that their father frequently said that if they told anyone about the goings-on in the household they would be \"buried under the patio\" like their sister Heather.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=22}}\n\n===Investigation===\nPolice began a full-scale investigation, eventually leading to Fred being charged with three counts of rape, and one of [[buggery]], with Rose as an accomplice. She was also charged with [[child abuse|child cruelty]], [[incitement|inciting]] her husband to engage in sex with their daughter,{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=245}} and [[obstructing government administration|obstructing the police]]. Fred and Rose were questioned as to the whereabouts of their eldest daughter, and although Fred claimed Heather was \"alive and well\" and supporting herself via prostitution, Rose initially claimed to have no knowledge of Heather's whereabouts, or why she had left home. She claimed on 11 August that she could \"remember now\" that her daughter had left home at her own persuasion due to Rose's concerns her other children may discover Heather's supposed lesbian inclinations. Rose then added she had also given her daughter \u00a3600 to incentivise her to leave the household, before further claiming to have maintained sporadic telephone contact with her daughter over the years.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=221}} The following day, Rose was granted [[bail]] on the condition she did not maintain contact with her children, her stepdaughter, or her husband prior to her upcoming trial.\n\nAs Fred awaited trial, he was held on remand in [[Birmingham]]. Learning that her father had denied any wrongdoing, Anna Marie also contacted police to offer a full statement detailing her experiences as a child. In a statement given to [[Constable#United Kingdom|Detective Constable]] Hazel Savage, Anna Marie recounted the extensive physical, [[psychological abuse|mental]] and sexual abuse she had endured as a child at the hands of her father and stepmother, before agreeing to testify against both parents at their upcoming trial. Anna Marie also added she had, for several years, been unsuccessfully attempting to trace her mother Rena and half-sisters Charmaine and Heather. Further enquiries conducted with Anna Marie's husband, Chris Davis, revealed that Heather had confided in him just how unhappy she was shortly before her disappearance, and of her desire to leave home. Davis elaborated that although Heather had not divulged any details about her enduring any sexual abuse, he had been so concerned for her welfare he had offered to confront Fred and Rose, and Heather had dissuaded him from doing so, blurting: \"For Christ's sake don't, because they'll kill us both!\" Davis then suggested they might wish to speak with Heather to garner further details of her abuse.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=217}}\n\nIn their efforts to gather further evidence, police and social services also spoke with Mae, who, having spoken with her 13-year-old sister and learned Louise did not wish to see her father charged, initially denied she had endured any molestation as an adolescent.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=26}} Police then focused their attentions on tracing Heather in efforts to corroborate Anna Marie's claims of sexual abuse, but enquiries to the [[Inland Revenue]] and the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Social Security department]] held no records attesting to her being alive. Two months later, Gloucester social services also contacted police to stress their concern over the whereabouts of Heather.\n\nThis case against the Wests collapsed when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister Louise declined to testify at the court case on 7 June 1993, with the child rape victim expressing her desire to return to her family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement because of her noting the misery of her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose's vindictiveness.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=20 }} Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.\n\n===Search warrant===\nAlthough the Wests were [[acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges, all their younger children remained in foster care, albeit with permitted [[supervised visitation]]s to Cromwell Street. Despite Fred and Rose claiming to the few relatives from whom they were not already [[family estrangement|estranged]] by 1993 that the charges had been fabricated by police, almost all of their remaining family members severed contact with them.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=229}} Meanwhile, police continued investigating the disappearance of Heather, noting no records existed indicating she was still alive. When Anna Marie was questioned as to the colloquial \"family joke\" regarding Heather being buried beneath the patio, she confirmed that the sole time she had heard her father recite this claim, he had immediately burst into laughter, leading to her refusing to take this claim seriously.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=28}}\n\nIn retracing Fred's history, police also discovered that although Rena and Charmaine had disappeared in 1971, no [[missing person]] report had ever been filed on either of them. DC Savage and her colleagues were convinced Heather was dead, and that Fred's repeated statement to his children that her body lay beneath the family patio might be true. On 23 February 1994, Gloucester police successfully applied for a search warrant authorising the search of 25 Cromwell Street to locate Heather's remains.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=528}}\n\nWhen police displayed this warrant to Rose on 24 February, she turned pale, before becoming hysterical and shouting over her shoulder to her eldest son, Stephen, \"Get Fred!\"{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=2 }} Rose became contradictory in her informal questioning as to the circumstances surrounding Heather's disappearance. When reminded of these contradictions, she became distraught and abusive, shouting at the officers: \"I can't fucking remember! It's a bloody long time ago! What do you think I am? A bloody computer?\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=32}}\n\nFred had been working in [[Stroud]] at the time; upon hearing of the police's intentions, he assured Stephen he would be home immediately. When Fred arrived three hours later, he informed his family of his intention to voluntarily offer a [[witness statement]] to police regarding his daughter's whereabouts.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3 }} Despite Fred's insistence in this statement that Heather had been \"alive and well\", albeit involved in a [[drug cartel|drugs cartel]], and that the claims he and his wife had made as to Heather being buried beneath the family patio were simply \"rubbish\", police were unassuaged. In response, Fred abruptly changed tactics, claiming they simply held a grudge against him due to his 1993 acquittal of the rape of his daughter.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3}}\n\nThat evening, with the search team having left their premises and a uniformed officer remaining at Cromwell Street to guard the [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation site]], Mae and Stephen observed their parents talking in hushed tones as they repeatedly glanced towards the garden from their kitchen window.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=236}}\n\n==Discoveries==\n\n===Arrest of Fred West===\nIn the early hours of the following morning, as his son Stephen was about to leave for work, Fred informed him: \"Look son, look after mum and sell the house [...] I've done something really bad. I want you to go to the papers and make as much money as you can.\"{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3 }} Shortly thereafter, police returned to Cromwell Street to continue their search for Heather's body. Upon their arrival, Fred indicated his wish to be arrested for Heather's murder and to be taken to Bearland police station to provide a full confession; he was then arrested and formally [[police caution|cautioned]].{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=32}}\n\nAt 11:15 that morning, Fred formally admitted to police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit in an act of [[manslaughter]]. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage, then dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=22 }} Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed [[appropriate adult]], Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]], before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.\n\nThe following day (26 February), police began excavating the section of the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had buried his daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human [[femur|thigh bone]] protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating the section of the garden where Fred had indicated he had buried his daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, with one kneecap and several phalange bones missing.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=244}} The decedent's fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via [[forensic dentistry|dental records]] as being that of Heather West.\n\nThat evening, having been formally charged with his daughter's murder and questioned as to why police had also discovered a third thigh bone, Fred confessed there were two further sets of human remains in his garden, and agreed to return to Cromwell Street to reveal the locations of both graves; one of whom he named as Shirley Robinson, whom he described as being a former tenant and a lesbian who had been heavily pregnant with his child at the time of her 1978 murder;{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=185}} the other victim he described (incorrectly) as being \"Shirley's mate\", but either could not or would not elaborate as to her identity. Both sets of remains were discovered on 28 February, and Fred was charged with both murders two days later.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=249}}\n\nHaving discovered three sets of human remains in the garden, a decision was made to thoroughly search the entire property. Rose was placed into a [[safe house]] in the nearby town of [[Dursley]] as police commenced their search inside 25 Cromwell Street. Informed of this fact, and with the formal interviews conducted by the investigative team lasting up to 16 hours each day and including persistent questioning as to the whereabouts of his first wife Rena and stepdaughter Charmaine,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=249}} Fred authorised his solicitor to pass a note he had written to the leader of the murder investigation: [[Superintendent (police)#United Kingdom|Superintendent]] John Bennett of the Gloucestershire Police. This note read: \"I, Frederick West, authorise my solicitor, Howard Ogden, to advise Superintendent Bennett that I wish to admit a further (approx) nine killings, expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified. F. West.\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=48}}\n\nQuestioned further as to his claims, Fred calmly explained there were a further five bodies buried in his cellar, and a sixth body beneath the ground-floor bathroom. Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls he had murdered in the 1970s after picking them up at bus stops. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, and that he had transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubical graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate precisely where he had buried each victim.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=251}}\n\nBetween 5 and 8 March, police found six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been extensively mutilated, and each body bore evidence of having been subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=167}} Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an effort to allow her to breathe prior to her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=255}} Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones; when questioned, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=549}}\n\n===Arrest of Rose West===\nDespite Fred's insistence that his wife held no knowledge of any of the murders,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=267}} investigators suspected otherwise. Rose was arrested on 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy\u2014both charges dating from the mid-1970s. The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to [[HM Prison Ashfield|Pucklechurch Prison]] to be held in the maximum security wing. Here, she was questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter Heather and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough's murder.\n\nBy 6 May, Fred and Rose were jointly charged with five counts of murder, with Rose simply replying, \"I'm innocent\" upon hearing each formal charge - a response that proved to be a theme throughout each of the 46 interviews investigators held with Rose prior to her trial.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=549}}\n\nAs well as the murders of the victims exhumed from Cromwell Street, Fred had confessed to the murders of his first wife and stepdaughter, and to knowing the location of Anne McFall's remains (although he always denied killing her). Fred agreed to identify each burial location, and the remains were unearthed between 10 April and 7 June.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=22}} He was then transferred to Birmingham's [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green Prison]], where a strict [[suicide watch]] called for his cell to be checked every 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/west-believed-suicide-would-save-rosemary-1328315.html|title=West Believed Suicide Would Save Rosemary|access-date=29 December 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 July 1996}}</ref>\n\n==Formal charges==\nFred and Rose West were brought before a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; he was charged with 11 murders and she with nine.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=276}} This was the first time the couple had seen each other since Fred's February arrest. Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred leaned toward his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose\u2014having ignored her husband's presence\u2014visibly winced in discomfort.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=272}} Both were ordered held on [[detention of suspects|remand]].\n\nAs police attempted to lead Fred from the hearing, he resisted their efforts, and again attempted to move towards Rose, who again winced and attempted to writhe away from his grasp.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=214}}\n\nImmediately after this court appearance, Fred was re-arrested on suspicion of murdering Anne McFall, whose body had been found on 7 June but had not been officially identified until this date; he was formally charged with McFall's murder on 3 July, appearing in court the following morning.{{sfn|Burn|1998|pages=440\u2013441}}\n\n===Diversion of culpability===\nAs he was held on remand at Winson Green Prison in the months following his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed. This became worse after Rose's public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter to her husband and in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him.\n\nFred pleaded with Stephen and Anna Marie (the only children to visit their father while on remand) to convey to Rose that he loved her, but Rose never acknowledged these overtures. In response, Fred withdrew his earlier confessions to having acted alone in the murders, and instead accused his wife of almost total [[culpability]] in all the murders to which he had been charged, excluding that of Anne McFall, which he claimed had been committed by his first wife.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13}}\n\n==Death==\n{{quote box\n| quote = To Rose West, Steve and Mae,\n\nWell Rose it's your birthday on 29 November 1994 and you will be 41 and still beautiful and still lovely and I love you.

He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred's sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner.\n\nAgainst the advice of her counsel, Rose herself testified; her affect sometimes morose and tearful, sometimes upbeat and humorous. She wept while describing herself as a victim of child abuse and rape who naively married a violent and domineering man, but joked about issues such as her \"always being pregnant\",{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=310}} and laughed while describing one victim's \"grandfather glasses\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=310}} She also claimed never to have met six of the victims buried at Cromwell Street, and to recall very little of her assault on Caroline Owens. When shown photographs of the victims buried in the cellar and victim Alison Chambers and asked by Brian Leveson whether she recognised any of their faces, Rose's face turned bright red, and she repeatedly stuttered as she replied, \"No, sir.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=311}}\n\nWhen questioned as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose claimed she and Fred had lived separate lives, which was inconsistent with the earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at their address.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996 |page=36}} In reference to her relationship with her eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained, before claiming to the court that her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after she had left home.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe defence next called a succession of women who claimed to have been attacked or assaulted by a lone male whose physical description matched that of Fred West between 1966 and 1975. These seven women each testified they had recognised their attacker as Fred West when his photograph appeared in the media in 1994. The intention of this testimony was to illustrate to the jury that Fred was capable of abducting, assaulting or attempting to attack women without Rose, which the prosecution had never disputed. The physical recollections of several of these women varied greatly.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Independent |location=UK | last = Bennett | first = Will | date = 3 November 1995 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/young-women-tell-of-attacks-by-fred-west-1537011.html | title = Young Women Tell of Attacks by Fred West | accessdate =16 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe final witness to testify at Rose's trial was Fred's appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, whom the prosecution had called to testify on 7 November in [[rebuttal]] to the tape recordings of Fred's confession which had been played to the court on 3 November and in which he had stressed Rose had \"known nothing at all\" about any of the murders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/chilling-tapes-let-court-into-mind-of-killer-1537155.html|title=Chilling Tapes Let Court into Mind of Killer|access-date=29 December 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 November 1995}}</ref> Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a [[confidant]]e, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a [[pact]] whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being \"some of Rose's mistakes\". He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. Fred had also confided that he had dismembered the victims, and Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, having personally removed Robinson's unborn child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had \"played a major part\" in these murders.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=324}}\n\nUpon cross examination, Leach did concede to Richard Ferguson she had earlier [[perjury|lied under oath]] about having sold her story to a national newspaper for \u00a3100,000, although she was adamant as to the sincerity of her testimony.

Much of this information was disjointed or told in a [[Third-person narrative|third party]] manner; Fred claimed that he had extensively tortured the victims prior to their murder, but had not raped them, instead engaging in acts of [[necrophilia]] with their bodies at or shortly after the point of death.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=204}} He also claimed the reason many phalange bones had been missing from the victims' bodies was because the removal of their fingers and toes had been one of the forms of torture the victims had endured, with other torture methods including the extraction of their nails,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=199}} acts of mutilation, and cigarettes being stubbed out on their bodies. Furthermore, the locations of almost all the burial sites of victims\u2014both discovered and undiscovered\u2014was symbolic to Fred, as each had been buried at or very close to the location he had lived in or worked at the time of the victim's murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=79}}\n\n===1967===\n* '''July''': Anne McFall, (18).

It is believed Fred killed Rena to avoid any investigation into Charmaine's whereabouts. She is believed to have been strangled to death by Fred before her extensively mutilated body was buried in Letterbox Field.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=119}}\n\n===1973===\n* c. '''20 April''': Lynda Gough, (19). The first sexually motivated killing the Wests are known to have committed together. Gough was a lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, and shared sex partners with Rose. Following her disappearance, Gough's mother called at Cromwell Street to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts, only to note Rose had been wearing her daughter's clothes and slippers. She was informed Lynda had moved to find work in [[Weston-super-Mare]]. Her remains were buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage, which was later converted into a bathroom.\n* '''10 November''': Carol Ann Cooper, (15). Cooper had been placed into care following her mother's death in 1966. She was last seen alive by her boyfriend in the suburb of Warndon boarding a bus to her grandmother's home. Cooper was the final victim unearthed from the cellar. Her skull was bound with surgical tape and her dismembered limbs bound with cord and braiding cloth.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|pages=145\u2013146}}\n* '''27 December''': [[Lucy Partington]], (21). Partington was an [[University of Exeter|Exeter University]] student and the cousin{{sfn|Amis|2000|page=5}} of novelist [[Martin Amis]]. She was abducted from a bus stop along the [[A435 road|A435]]. Her precise date of death may have been one week after her disappearance, as Fred admitted himself into the casualty unit of the Gloucester Royal Hospital with a serious laceration of his right hand on 3 January, possibly sustained as he dismembered Partington's body. Her body was discovered in the Cromwell Street cellar on 6 March 1994.<ref>\"Amis pays tribute to victim\", ''The Times'', 17 April 1995.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/may/11/features11.g2|title=When Darkness met Light|access-date=24 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 May 2000}}</ref>\n\n===1974===\n* '''16 April''': Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Siegenthaler, (21). A [[sociology]] student at [[Greenwich Community College]]. Siegenthaler was abducted by the Wests as she hitchhiked from [[South London]] to [[Holyhead]]. Fred mistook her Swiss accent to be a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] one, and always referred to her as either \"the Dutch girl\" or \"Tulip\". She was reported missing to [[Scotland Yard]] by her family in Switzerland when communication from their daughter ceased.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=154}} Fred later further concealed Siegenthaler's remains by building a false [[chimney breast]] on her grave.\n* '''15 November''': Shirley Hubbard, (15). A foster child abducted from a [[Droitwich Spa|Droitwich]] bus stop close to the [[River Severn]] as she travelled home from a date.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=156}} Aged 15 when murdered, Hubbard had been attending work experience in Worcester, and was last seen by her boyfriend, having promised to meet him the next day. When her dismembered remains were found in a section of the cellar known to the family as the \"[[Marilyn Monroe]] area\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=157}} Her head had been completely covered in tape, with a one-eighth-of-an-inch diameter rubber tube inserted three inches into her nasal cavity to enable her to breathe.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=156}}\n\n===1975===\n* '''12 April''': Juanita Mott, (18). Mott had been a former lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, but was living with a family friend in [[Newent]] when she disappeared. Mott is believed to have been abducted by the Wests as she hitchhiked along the [[B4215]]. In his subsequent confessions to police, Fred would refer to Mott as \"the girl from Newent\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=160}}\n\n===1978===\n* '''10 May''': Shirley Robinson, (18). Another former lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, Robinson had been [[bisexual]] and had engaged in casual sex with Fred and Rose. At the time of her disappearance, she had been eight months pregnant with Fred's child, and her baby had been due to be born on 11 June. No sexual motive existed for this murder, and the prosecution contended at Rose's trial that Robinson had been murdered as her pregnancy threatened the stability of the Wests' relationship.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=262}} Fred had originally planned to sell their baby to a childless couple and had photographs taken with Robinson for this purpose.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=178}}\n\n===1979===\n* '''5 August''': Alison Chambers, (16). Chambers had been placed into foster care at the age of 14, and had repeatedly absconded from Jordan's Brook House. She became acquainted with the Wests in mid-1979, and Fred later claimed to his solicitor that Chambers had died as a result of Rose becoming \"too bloody vicious\" with her. Her dismembered body, missing several bones and with a leather belt looped beneath her jaw and tied at the top of her head, was buried in the garden of Cromwell Street. This was the final murder where a sexual motive was established.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=254}}\n\n===1987===\n* '''19 June''': Heather West, (16). Heather was likely to have been murdered because Fred and Rose considered her efforts to leave the household as a threat, as she divulged to her classmates the extensive physical and sexual abuse which occurred at Cromwell Street.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} Fred claimed he had not intended to kill his daughter, but carpet fibres found on two lengths of rope, discovered with her remains, suggested that she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Her body was dismembered with a heavy serrated knife and later buried in a hole in the garden which Fred had his son dig, under the pretence of installing a fish pond.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=199}} The 1994 police investigation into Heather's disappearance led to the discovery of her body, and the arrest of both her parents.\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n* As well as the 12 confirmed victims, police firmly believe Fred is also responsible for the 1968 disappearance of 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, but to date no body has been found.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fred West 'murder victim' petition rejected |date=6 January 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-16439869 |newspaper=BBC}}</ref> West's son, Stephen, has said he firmly believes the missing teenager was an early victim of his father, as Fred had openly boasted of having committed Bastholm's murder while on remand. Police were unable to charge Fred with this crime as they had no evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/69928.stm |title=Fred West 'admitted killing waitress'|work=BBC News |date= 25 March 1998}}</ref>\n* No [[forensic evidence]] linked Fred to the murder of Anne McFall, and he always denied killing her. Her body had been extensively dismembered, and was missing several phalange bones, and the cubic dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of Fred's later murders.{{sfn|Burn|1998|pages=146\u2013147}}\n\n==Possible additional victims==\nPolice firmly believe the Wests were responsible for further unsolved murders and disappearances. They believed they committed ten murders between 1971 and 1979, at least seven of which were for sexual purposes. Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978. They committed one further murder in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until they murdered their daughter in 1987. Police do not know of any further murders they committed before their 1994 arrest.\n\nDuring formal questioning, Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, indicating up to 18 other undiscovered victims.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/how-many-more-did-they-kill-1583214.html |title=How Many More did they Kill?|newspaper=The Independent |date= 23 November 1995|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nFred's remarkably relaxed, emotionally sterile attitude towards all aspects of his crimes startled many members of the enquiry team. This prompted Superintendent John Bennett to seek the assistance of a [[criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] for an expert opinion on Fred's state of mind. After analysing Fred's behaviour throughout the extensive 1994 interviews, psychologist Paul Britton advised Superintendent Bennett that Fred's blas\u00e9 manner indicated he had committed so many offences over such a long period that he was now indifferent to the acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Britton added that although an offender of this nature may come to offend less frequently, he would be unlikely to cease killing altogether.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=252}}\n\nOne theory which may explain the sudden lull in the frequency of their murders is the fact that by the mid-1970s, the Wests had begun a practice of befriending teenage girls from nearby care homes, many of whom they sexually abused, with others encouraged to engage in prostitution within their home.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=412}} The Wests established acquaintances\u2014including several of their lodgers\u2014willing to partake in their shared fetishes, which may have satiated the couple to a degree.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/pasts-sadistic-gloucester-serial-killers-fred/story-24272090-detail/story.html |title=Pasts of Sadistic Gloucester Serial Killers Fred and Rose West to be Shown in Channel 5 Documentary |publisher=Somerset Live |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nCaroline Owens, Anna Marie West, and several other survivors of sexual assaults at the Wests' hands each testified at Rose's trial that she had been by far the more calculating, aggressive and controlling of the two. Owens stated that, at one stage in her ordeal, Fred said that they had abducted Owens primarily for Rose's gratification.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|pages=137\u2013138}} It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts\u2014willing or unwilling\u2014to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for their satisfaction.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=138}}\n\nFour young girls similar in age and physical characteristics to those Fred was later charged with murdering in Gloucestershire are known to have disappeared during the time Fred lived in Glasgow\u2014one of whom, Margaret McAvoy, Fred had been acquainted with. He had also rented a garden allotment adjacent to his house and which he frequently visited, although only a small section of this plot was ever [[horticulture|cultivated]]. To one neighbour, Fred remarked that he used the remainder for \"something special\", about which he refused to elaborate. Much of the supposed cultivation of this allotment occurred in the early hours of the morning.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/>\n\nPolice were unable to investigate whether any further bodies were buried at this location, as these allotments were built over in the 1970s as a section of the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]].{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=11}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nFred's body was [[cremation|cremated]] in [[Coventry]] on 29 March 1995. This service was held with only four family members present. In a five-minute service, in which no hymns were sung, the [[The Reverend|Reverend]] Robert Simpson quoted sections of [[Psalm 23]], then added a solemn reminder to those present that they must \"also remember everyone else who has also suffered because of these tragic events\". His ashes were scattered at the Welsh seaside resort of [[Barry Island]], a location he had regularly visited both as a child and as an adult with his family.<ref>''The Devil in Detail'' p. 24</ref>\n\nAfter the 1994 arrest of their parents, the four youngest West children (born between 1978 and 1983), were given new identities to protect them from the notoriety of their family. Each child remained in foster care.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=37}}\n\nThe remains of Charmaine and Rena were cremated in [[Kettering]]. At the insistence of Anna Marie West, mother and daughter shared the same coffin, and no roses were to be brought to the service by any mourners.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=288}}\n\nAs a direct result of her tenacity in investigating the Wests, DC Hazel Savage was placed upon the annual [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year's honours list]].

(29 September 1941&nbsp;\u2013 1 January 1995) was an English [[serial killer]] who committed at least 12 murders between 1967 and 1987 in [[Gloucestershire]], the majority with his second wife, [[Rosemary West]].\n\nAll the victims were young women. At least eight of these murders involved the Wests' sexual gratification and included [[rape]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[torture]] and [[mutilation]]; the victims' [[dismemberment|dismembered]] bodies were typically buried in the cellar or garden of the Wests' Cromwell Street home in [[Gloucester]], which became known as the \"House of Horrors\". Fred is known to have committed at least two murders on his own, while Rose is known to have murdered Fred's stepdaughter, Charmaine. The couple were apprehended and charged in 1994.\n\nFred West fatally [[asphyxia|asphyxiated himself]] while on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] at [[HM Prison Birmingham]] on 1 January 1995, at which time he and Rose were jointly charged with nine murders, and he with three further murders. In November 1995, Rose was convicted of ten murders and sentenced to ten [[life imprisonment|life terms]] with a [[whole life order]].\n<!-- PER WP:LEADCITE NOTHING CITED IN THE BODY NEEDS TO BE CITED HERE -->\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nFrederick Walter Stephen West was born on 29 September 1941{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=13}} at Bickerton Cottage, [[Much Marcle]], [[Herefordshire]],{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=151}} the first surviving child born to Walter Stephen West (5 July 1914 \u2013 28 March 1992) and Daisy Hannah Hill (20 May 1922 \u2013 6 February 1968).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV3H-YM4B |title=Daisy H Hill: England and Wales Birth Registration Index |publisher=familysearch.org |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref> His was a poor family of farm workers, close-knit and mutually protective; his father was a [[discipline|disciplinarian]] and his mother overprotective.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|pages=7\u20138}}\n[[File:Great Moorcourt Farm - geograph.org.uk - 1069609.jpg|thumb|Moorcourt Farm, [[Much Marcle]], where West lived, in Moorcourt Cottage, 1946{{ndash}}1961]]\nIn 1946, the family moved to Moorcourt Cottage at Moorcourt Farm, where Fred's father worked as a [[Pastoral farming|milking herdsman]] and harvest hand. The cottage had no electricity and was heated by a log fireplace.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=98}} By 1951, Fred's mother had given birth to eight children, six of whom survived, but Fred was always his mother's favourite.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=17}} He was seen as a [[mother's boy]], and relied mostly on his siblings for companionship.\n\nThe West children were expected to perform assigned chores,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=17}} and all six did seasonal work, the three girls picking hops and strawberries, the three boys harvesting wheat and hunting rabbits. The necessity of working to earn a living, or even just to survive, instilled a strong [[work ethic]] in Fred,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=19}} who also developed a lifelong habit of petty theft.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=169}}\n\nClassmates recall Fred as scruffy, dim, lethargic, and regularly in trouble.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=17}} Throughout his life, he remained scarcely [[literacy|literate]], yet displayed an aptitude for woodwork and artwork.

He aggressively pestered women and girls, whom he [[Objectification|objectified]] as sources of pleasure to be used as he saw fit, and would abruptly approach and fondle them.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=23}} When a girl acquiesced to his advances, she would find his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=29}}\n\nShortly after his 17th birthday, Fred bought a motorcycle, and two months later suffered a [[skull fracture|fractured skull]], a broken arm, and a broken leg in an accident. He was unconscious for seven days and walked with [[orthotics|braces]] for several months;{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=25}} because of this incident, he developed an extreme fear of hospitals and became prone to fits of rage. Two years later, he suffered a further head injury when a girl he groped on a fire escape outside the Ledbury Youth Club punched him, sending him falling two floors.<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1632:1923/1/Fred_West.htm |website=The Biography Channel |title=Fred West |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829144623/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1632%3A1923/1/Fred_West.htm |archive-date=29 August 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1961,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=90}} Fred's 13-year-old sister, Kitty, told her mother that Fred had been raping her since the previous December, and had impregnated her.

He had first met Costello\u2014who came from [[Coatbridge]], [[Lanarkshire]]{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=88}}\u2014at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=28}} Costello was pregnant by an [[Asian people|Asian]] bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from [[Glasgow]] to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed race child.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=61}} She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=59}} The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver. Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963;{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=61}} to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a [[miscarriage]] and that Charmaine was adopted. Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] district of Glasgow.\n\nIn July 1964, Rena bore Fred a daughter, Anna Marie.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=136}} The child was born at the couple's Savoy Street home.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=13}}<ref name=\"Life and Death of a Good Mother\">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12062252.Life_and_death_of_a_good_mother/ |title=Life and Death of a Good Mother|access-date=26 October 2016|newspaper=The Herald|date=22 November 1995}}</ref> The family nanny, Isa McNeill, and neighbours of the Wests, recall Rena as a considerate mother \"struggling to bring up two children\";<ref name=\"Life and Death of a Good Mother\"/> Fred treated the children harshly.

When Rena discovered her husband's [[infidelity]], she began an affair with a man named John McLachlan. On one occasion, Fred discovered the pair in an embrace. He punched Rena, making her scream. In response, McLachlan punched Fred, who drew a knife and grazed McLachlan's stomach. When punched by McLachlan a second time, Fred stopped defending himself. Years later, McLachlan recollected this incident: \"He couldn't tackle a man, but he wasn't so slow in attacking women.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=66}} He and Rena continued their affair, and McLachlan became increasingly aghast at Rena's bruises and black eyes. On each occasion it became apparent Fred had beaten his wife, McLachlan extensively beat Fred.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/> Another time, McLachlan witnessed Charmaine\u2014little older than a toddler\u2014ask Fred for an ice cream from his van; in response, Fred struck her across the head, triggering another beating from McLachlan.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/>\n\nOn 4 November 1965, Fred accidentally ran over and killed a small boy in Glasgow with his van.{{sfn|Sounes|1995}} Fred was cleared of any wrongdoing by police,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=68}} but feared the hostile reaction and potential reprisals for the accident from the locals, whom he relied upon to make his living. In December, he returned to Gloucester with Charmaine and Anna Marie, renting a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park in [[Bishop's Cleeve]]. Rena joined him in February 1966,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=98}} accompanied by Isa McNeill and Anne McFall, who also moved into Fred's caravan. (McNeill and McFall both came from impoverished backgrounds; both hoped to find work in England.){{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=69}} Shortly after the move south, Fred found employment driving a lorry for a local [[abattoir]].\n\nBy early 1966, Fred had begun to exhibit [[Abusive power and control|dominance and control]] over all three women. He was also prone to violent mood swings, and Rena and McNeill typically bore the brunt of his fury; Fred also physically attacked his stepdaughter more than once. He is also reported to have begun [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] Charmaine,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13 }} and to have encouraged Rena to turn to [[prostitution]] to supplement his meagre income.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996||page=12 }}\n\nTo escape Fred's [[domestic abuse]] and increasingly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] sexual demands, Rena phoned McLachlan, begging him to rescue her, McNeill and her children. Together, McLachlan, Rena, and McNeill devised a plan; he and McNeill's boyfriend, John Trotter,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=97}} would secretly drive to Bishop's Cleeve in McLachlan's [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967|Mini]] and discreetly take Rena, her children and McNeill back to Scotland.<ref name=\"Life and Death of a Good Mother\"/> McFall had by this stage become infatuated with Fred, who had promised to marry her. It is likely she informed Fred of the plan,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=71}} as he arrived at the meeting time, and McFall was \"oddly calm\" as she informed McNeill she intended to remain with Fred to work as the children's nanny. An altercation ensued between Fred and McLachlan, resulting in Fred being struck several times as he clutched onto Charmaine and Anna Marie. Police were called and McLachlan, Trotter, McNeill, and Rena left, with Fred threatening to kill Rena should he ever see her again.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=71}}\n\nTo ensure her daughters' well-being, Rena frequently travelled to England to visit Charmaine and Anna Marie while they lived with Fred at Bishop's Cleeve.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13}} Despite initially maintaining her friendship with McFall, Rena soon began to resent her matriarchal presence around her daughters. On 11 October,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=19}} in an act of resentment, Rena stole some belongings from Fred's caravan and returned to Glasgow. She was arrested the following month and returned to Gloucester to face trial. On 29 November, Rena was sentenced to three years' [[probation]]. Fred testified at the hearing, admitting he and McFall were living together, but falsely claiming McFall intended to return to Scotland imminently.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=74}}\n\nAfter the trial, McFall moved into a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park; Rena alternated between living with Fred and returning to Glasgow. Letters McFall posted to her family and McNeill in Glasgow between 1966 and 1967 indicate she believed a relationship with Fred could offer her a better life than that she had experienced in Scotland,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=72}} and she tried to persuade Fred to divorce his wife in order that he could marry her.\n\n===Murder of Anne McFall===\nIn July 1967,{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=72}} McFall, aged 18 and eight months pregnant with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her [[dismemberment|dismembered]] remains were found buried at the edge of a cornfield between Much Marcle and [[Kempley]] in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully [[disarticulation|disarticulated]], and many [[phalanx bone|phalange bones]] were missing from her body\u2014likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=207}} Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=76}}\n\nThe following month, Rena returned to live with Fred, and the couple relocated to the Lake House Caravan Park. Their relationship initially improved, but Rena left the following year, again leaving the children in his care. On these occasions when Fred had no woman to supervise and care for the girls, he temporarily placed them in the [[Child care#Common types|care]] of Gloucester [[social services]].{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=92}}\n\n==Rosemary Letts==\nFred first encountered Rosemary Letts in early 1969, shortly after her 15th birthday.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=106\u2013107}} The pair first met at [[Cheltenham]] bus station. Initially, Rose was repulsed by Fred's unkempt appearance, and deduced he was a tramp, but she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred, but allowed him to accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly [[promiscuity|promiscuous]]. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=88}}\n\nHaving discovered Rose worked in a nearby bread shop, a few days after their first encounter, Fred persuaded an unknown woman to enter the premises and present her with a gift accompanied by the explanation that a \"man outside\" had asked her to present this gift to her.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=113}} Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening; an offer she accepted.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=87}} Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the Lake House Caravan Park, and a willing childminder to Charmaine and Anna Marie, whom she noted were [[Child neglect|neglected]] and whom she initially treated with care and affection. On several occasions in the early days of their courtship, Rose insisted she and Fred take the girls on excursions to gather wild flowers.\n\nWithin weeks of her first meeting Fred, Rose left her job at the bread shop in order to become the nanny to Charmaine and Anna Marie; this decision was made with the agreement that Fred would provide her with sufficient money to give to her parents on Fridays to convince them she was still obtaining a salary at the bread shop.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=119}} Several months later, Rose introduced Fred to her family, who were aghast at their daughter's choice of partner. Rose's mother, Daisy Letts, was unimpressed with Fred's braggadocio, and correctly concluded he was a [[pathological lying|pathological liar]]; her father, Bill Letts\u2014a diagnosed [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] who is believed to have molested his daughter\u2014vehemently disapproved of the relationship, threatening Fred directly and promising to call social services if he continued to date his daughter.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=120}}\n\n===Relationship===\nRose's parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was dating an older man, and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at his caravan.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=15 }} In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=96}} and only allowed to leave under controlled conditions. When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=96}}\n\nOn her 16th birthday, Rose left the home for troubled teenagers to return to her parents (Fred at the time serving a 30-day sentence for theft and unpaid fines). Upon Fred's release, Rose left her parents' home to move into the Cheltenham flat Fred then lived in. Shortly thereafter, Fred collected Charmaine and Anna Marie from social services. Bill Letts made one final effort to prevent his daughter from seeing Fred, and Rose was examined by a police surgeon in February 1970, who confirmed she was pregnant. In response, Rose was again placed into care, but was discharged on 6 March on the understanding she would terminate her pregnancy and return to her family. Instead, Rose opted to live with Fred, resulting in her father forbidding his daughter from ever again setting foot in his household.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=99}}\n\nThree months later, the couple vacated the Cheltenham flat and relocated to the ground floor flat of a two-storey house in Midland Road, Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (speculation remains that Heather may have been sired by Rose's own father).{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} Two months later, Fred was imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle [[Vehicle licence#United Kingdom|tax disc]]. He remained imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with Charmaine and Anna Marie being told to refer to Rose as their mother.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=123}}\n\nAccording to Anna Marie West, she and Charmaine were frequently subjected to criticism, beatings, and other forms of punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose's care at Midland Road, but although Anna Marie was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in response to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was physically punished. Despite the years of neglect and abuse, Charmaine's spirit had not been broken,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=91}} and she talked wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held that her \"mummy will come and save me\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=105}} Anna Marie later recollected her sister repeatedly antagonised Rose by making statements such as: \"My real mummy wouldn't swear or shout at us\" in response to Rose's scathing language.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=67}} A childhood friend of Charmaine's named Tracey Giles, who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road, would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests' flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Giles, Charmaine had been \"calm and unconcerned\", while Anna Marie had been standing by the door with a blank expression on her face.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=134}}\n\nHospital records reveal Charmaine had received treatment for a severe [[penetrating trauma|puncture wound]] to her left ankle in the [[Emergency department|casualty unit]] of the [[Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|Gloucester Royal Hospital]] on 28 March 1971. This incident was explained by Rose to have resulted from a household accident.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=138}}\n\n===Murder of Charmaine West===\nRose is believed to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred's prison release date of 24 June 1971. She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June. It is believed to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered. As well as [[forensic science|forensic]] [[dentistry|odontology]] confirmation that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Giles' mother, Shirley, [[corroborating evidence|corroborated]] the fact that Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June. In her later testimony at Rose's trial, Shirley Giles stated she and her family had lived in the upper flat of 25 Midland Road in 1971, and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie. Shirley Giles stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: \"She's gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!\"<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\" /> before Tracey began to weep.\n\nAs with the Giles family, Rose explained Charmaine's disappearance to others who enquired about her whereabouts by claiming that Rena had called and taken her eldest daughter to live with her in [[Bristol]]; she informed staff at Charmaine's primary school that the child had moved with her mother to [[London]].{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=146}} When Fred was released from prison on 24 June, he allayed Anna Marie's concerns for her sister's whereabouts by claiming her mother had collected Charmaine and returned to Scotland. In her autobiography, ''Out of the Shadows'', Anna Marie recollected that when she asked why her mother had collected Charmaine but not her, Fred callously replied: \"She wouldn't want you, love. You're the wrong colour.\"{{sfn|West|1995|page=59}}\n\nCharmaine's body was initially stowed in the coal cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He later buried her naked body in the yard close to the back door of the flat, and he remained adamant he had not dismembered her. A subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip; this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976. Several bones\u2014particularly [[patellae]], finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones\u2014were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this proved to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=114}}\n\n===Murder of Catherine \"Rena\" West===\nRena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated. She is also known to have visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children's whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=114}} Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and extremely anxious about her children's welfare. Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him\u2014likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the final time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by [[strangulation]], possibly in the back seat of Fred's [[Ford Popular#Ford Popular 100E|Ford Popular]] and likely while intoxicated.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=121}} When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a [[sexual assault]] prior to her murder. Rena's body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at Letterbox Field.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=14 }}\n\n==Marriage to Letts==\nOn 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary married. The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself as a [[bachelor]] upon the marriage certificate. No family or friends were invited.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=124}} Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street. Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for \u00a37,000.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=265}} To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms were initially converted into [[bedsit]]s, to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only he and his family were permitted access to the garden of the property. On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter. The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=158}}\n\n===Prostitution===\nShortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at their residence and advertising her services in a local [[classified magazine#contact magazines|contact magazine]]. Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester's [[West Indies|West Indian]]{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=220}} community through these advertisements. In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in [[casual sex]] with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28 }} When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner with acts such as partially suffocating her partner, or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner's body. If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: \"Aren't you woman enough to take it?\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=209}}\n\nTo many of these women, it became apparent Rose and her husband (who regularly participated in [[threesome]]s with his wife and her lovers) took a particular pleasure from seeking to take women beyond their sexual limits\u2014typically via sessions involving [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], as the Wests openly admitted to taking a particular pleasure from any form of sex involving a strong measure of dominance, pain and violence. To cater to these [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]], they amassed a large collection of bondage and restraining devices, magazines and photographs\u2014later expanding this collection to include videos depicting bestiality and graphic [[child sexual abuse]].{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=30 }}\n\nRose controlled the West family finances, Fred giving her his pay packets.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=273}} The room Rose used for prostitution was known throughout the West household as \"Rose's Room\", and had several hidden peepholes allowing Fred\u2014a longtime [[voyeur]]\u2014to watch her entertain her clients. He also installed a [[baby monitor]] in the room, allowing him to listen from elsewhere in the house. The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose was not to be disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room around her neck,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=202}} and Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which Rose's clients were instructed to ring whenever they visited the household. Much of the money earned from Rose's prostitution was spent on home improvements.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=222}}{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=29}}\n\nBy 1977, Rose's father had come to tolerate his daughter's marriage, and to develop a grudging respect for Fred. Together, he and Fred opened a caf\u00e9 they named The Green Lantern, which was soon insolvent. When Bill Letts discovered Rose's prostitution, he would also visit to have sex with his daughter.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,1148300,00.html \"Euan Ferguson on the Legacy of Fred West\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 February 2004</ref> By 1983, she had given birth to eight children, at least three of whom were conceived by clients. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own, and falsely informed them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his great-grandmother was a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/'Men+just+can't+handle+the+fact+that+Fredand+Rose+West+are+my+mum+and...-a061392718 |title=Men Just Can't Handle the Fact that Fred and Rose West are my Mum and Dad|publisher=thefreelibrary.com |date=4 September 2000 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nWhen each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment\u2014almost always physical\u2014being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. The children feared being the recipients of violence from their parents, the vast majority inflicted by Rose, occasionally by Fred. The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose's gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults. Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), ran away from home; both returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends, and both were beaten when they returned home.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=194}} Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency]] department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=344}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/more-questions-than-answers-1583744.html|title=More Questions than Answers|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=18 December 2016 |first1=Tanya |last1=Sillem |first2=Paul |last2=Wandless |date=26 November 1995}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion, as Stephen was mopping the kitchen floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using. In response, Rose hit the boy over the head with the bowl, then repeatedly kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: \"You did that on purpose, you little swine!\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=67}} On another occasion, Rose became furious about a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae screamed, \"No, Mum! No, Mum!\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=69}} as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing.\n\nEven Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in August 1974,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=154-155}} Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand; Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose lunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and three of Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: \"Look what you done, fella. You've got to take me to the hospital now.\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=201}}\n\n==Initial sexual assaults==\n\n===Anna Marie West===\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was ordered to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=70}} She was then stripped naked, bound to a mattress and gagged before Fred [[rape]]d her{{sfn|Wansell|1996}} with Rose's active encouragement. After the rape, Rose explained to the child: \"Everybody does it to every girl. It's a father's job. Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=71}} Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/fred-west-17169706#crimes |title=Freed West Biography |publisher=biography.com |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nRose occasionally sexually abused Anna Marie herself, and later took extreme gratification in degrading her with acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=170}} From the age of 13, Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Rose was always present in the room when these acts occurred,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=170}} to ensure Anna Marie did not reveal her true age.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=178}} On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged 13 or 14, Rose took her to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of [[barley wine]]. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once they had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked her: \"Do you think you could be my friend?\" before she was sexually abused by her father and stepmother.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=214\u2013215}}\n\n===Caroline Owens===\nIn October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children's nanny. They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from [[Tewkesbury]] to her [[Cinderford]] home, having visited her boyfriend. Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, the Wests offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday. Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street, sharing a room with Anna Marie, whom Owens noted was \"very withdrawn\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=133}}\n\nRose, who had begun to engage in prostitution by this time, explained to Owens that she worked as a [[massage|masseuse]] when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her.<ref name=\"CRHH\">{{YouTube|aYp5gKhqJK4|Fred and Rose West- The House of Horrors 3/4}}</ref> According to Owens, Fred also said he was a skilled [[abortion]]ist, who was available should she ever need such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests' overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.{{sfn|Roberts|2005}}\n\nKnowing Owens' habits of hitchhiking along the [[A40 road|A40]] between Cinderford and Tewkesbury, the Wests formulated a plan to abduct her for their shared gratification. Fred later admitted that the specific intent of this abduction was the rape and likely murder of Owens, but that his initial incentive was to determine whether his wife would be willing to at least assist him in an abduction.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=134}} On 6 December 1972, the couple lured Owens into their vehicle with an apology for their conduct and the offer of a lift home.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> Initially, Owens believed the Wests had been sincere in their apologies to her and obliged, believing she had simply mistaken their earlier intentions. Rose joined her in the back seat, with the explanation she wanted a \"girls' chat\" as Fred drove.\n\nShortly thereafter, Rose began to fondle her, as Fred questioned whether she had had sex with her boyfriend that evening.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=135}} When Owens began to protest, Fred stopped the car, referred to Owens as a \"bitch\", and punched her into [[unconsciousness]] before he and Rose bound and gagged her with a scarf and duct tape.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28}} In her subsequent statement to police, Owens stated that, at Cromwell Street, she was given a drugged cup of tea to drink, then again gagged and subjected to a prolonged sexual assault from Fred and Rose. At one stage, Fred remarked that Owens' [[clitoris]] was unusual<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> then lashed her genitals with a leather belt. When Owens screamed, Rose again smothered her with a pillow and further restrained her about the neck, and performed [[cunnilingus]] on her. Quickly realising the gravity of her situation, Owens ceased resisting their sexual assaults.<ref name=\"CRHH\"/>\n\nThe following morning, having noted Owens' screaming when one of his children had knocked on the door of the room in which she was restrained, Fred threatened that he and his wife would keep her locked up in the cellar and allow his \"black friends\" to abuse her, and that when they had finished, he would bury her body beneath \"the paving stones of Gloucester\".<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> Fred then claimed he had killed hundreds of young girls,<ref name=\"CRHH\"/> adding that Owens had primarily been brought to the house for \"Rose's pleasure\". He and Rose then calmly asked Owens whether she would consider returning to work as their nanny. Seeing her escape avenue, Owens agreed, and vacuumed the house to indicate her belief in becoming an extended member of the family. Later that day, Owens escaped from a [[launderette]] she and Rose had entered and returned home. Although initially too ashamed to divulge to her mother what had happened, when her mother noted the welts, bruises and exposed [[subcutaneous tissues]] on her daughter's body, Owens burst into tears and confided what had happened.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=39}}\n\nOwens' mother immediately reported her daughter's ordeal to the police, and the Wests were arrested and charged with [[assault]], [[Indecent assault#England and Wales|indecent assault]], [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]], and rape. The case was tried at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 12 January 1973, but by this date, Owens had decided she could not face the ordeal of testifying in court. All charges pertaining to her sexual abuse were dropped, and the Wests agreed to [[guilt (law)|plead guilty]] to the reduced charges of indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm; each was fined \u00a350, and the couple were allowed to walk free from court.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3509899.stm | title = Surviving Fred and Rose | date = 24 February 2004 | accessdate =1 June 2008 |work=BBC News }}</ref> When Owens heard this news, she attempted suicide.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=28}}\n\n==Murders==\nThree months after the Wests' assault trial, the couple committed their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into their home on Cromwell Street. On or about 20 April,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=159}} other tenants were told that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was repeated to Gough's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire about her whereabouts (Rose had been wearing Lynda's clothing when she repeated this claim).\n\nWhen Gough's dismembered body was found, the jaw was completely wrapped in adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] to allow breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Gough had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred later admitted he had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims' bodies, and likely died of either strangulation or suffocation.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=65}} Her dismembered body, missing five [[cervical vertebrae]], the patellae and numerous phalange bones, was buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=71}}\n\nFrom their later investigations, police and [[forensic science|forensic experts]] concluded all the victims found in the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street had been murdered in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=29}} Five victims were murdered and buried in the cellar at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children's Home in [[Worcester]], and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She had been waiting for a bus in [[Warndon]] when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred's car,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=163}} where her face was bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests' address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper died from strangulation or asphyxiation, before her body was dismembered and buried in a shallow, [[cube|cubical]] grave in the cellar.\n\nOver the following 17 months, four further victims between the ages of 15 and 21 suffered a similar fate to that endured by Gough and Cooper, although the disarticulation conducted upon each successive victim, plus the [[paraphernalia]] discovered in each shallow grave, suggests each victim was likely subjected to greater abuse and torture than those previously murdered.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=156}}\n\nFollowing the murder of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted over the floor of the entire cellar. He later converted this section of the household into a bedroom for his oldest children,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=201}} and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred\u2014either with or without Rose's participation but certainly with her knowledge{{sfn|Wilson|1998|pages=184\u2013186}}\u2014murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had taken lodgings with the Wests in April 1977, and was heavily pregnant at the time of her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=179}} Although Rose\u2014herself pregnant at the time\u2014initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband's;{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=294}} she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal of a threat to the stability of the Wests' relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street. It was extensively dismembered, but no restraining devices were found with these remains, making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=175}} The unborn baby had been removed and had several bones missing. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for [[Maternity Allowance|maternity benefit]] in Shirley's name with Gloucester social services.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=185}} As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who asked about Robinson's whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/step-daughter-charmaine-was-first-to-die-1583071.html|title=Step-daughter Charmaine was first to die|access-date=17 November 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=22 November 1995}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|Several weeks after the murder of Shirley Robinson, Fred and Rose informed other lodgers they had received news Robinson had given birth to a baby boy in West Germany, and that she had named her child Barry.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=179}}}}\n\nThe final murder Fred and Rose are known to have committed with a definite sexual motive occurred on 5 August 1979. The victim was a 16-year-old named Alison Chambers, who had run away from a local children's home to become the Wests' live-in nanny in the middle of 1979. Chambers is believed to have lived within their household for several weeks before her murder, and Rose promised Chambers she could live at a rural \"peaceful farm\" she claimed she and Fred owned.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=183-184}} Her body was also buried in the garden of Cromwell Street, close to the bathroom wall, and although Chambers was likely dismembered,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=247}} her skeleton was not marked by striations as the earlier victims' bodies had been. In an effort to allay any concerns from Chambers' family (with whom she maintained regular correspondence), Fred and Rose later posted a letter written by Chambers to her mother prior to her murder from a [[Northamptonshire]] post box.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=194}}\n\n===Abuse===\n[[File:WestFamilyBasementCromwellStreet14Jan1984.jpg|thumb|The West family, pictured in their Cromwell Street home on the date of Anna Marie West's January 1984 marriage. Heather, aged 13 is at the extreme right]]\nHeather and Mae West became the focus of Fred's incestuous{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home in 1979{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=187}} after enduring a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an [[ectopic pregnancy]].{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=234}} The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls reached [[puberty]]. Fred was overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: \"I made you; I can do what I like with you.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=191}} He further referred to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him. As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped. Both girls also developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door. Stephen was also informed by his father that he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (in the event, his parents evicted him from their home when he was 16).{{sfn|Wilson|1998|pages=204\u2013205}}\n\nAlthough the girls were repulsed by their father's behaviour, Mae\u2014having once endured Fred's throwing a vacuum cleaner at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her\u2014developed a [[Defence mechanisms|mechanism]] whereby she would tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her, then jokingly brush aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=205}} whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather \"was affected quite badly by all of this. [Even] more than me.\"{{sfn|West|West|1995|page=79}} A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather had been forced to engage in intercourse with her father,{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=6 }} as by the mid-1980s, she developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled;{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=235}} drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through the corner of her eye wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=172}} This distressful behaviour led to Fred and Rose suspecting Heather had [[lesbian]] inclinations, and also resulted in her becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was \"ugly\" and a \"bitch\". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=234}}\n\nHeather also expressed to Mae and Stephen her desire to run away from home and live a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle in the [[Forest of Dean]], and to never again see any human beings.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=236}}\n\n==Murder of Heather West==\nHeather did complain to friends about the abuse she and her siblings endured, and her external signs of [[mental distress|psychological distress]] were noted by several of them. Staff at the [[Hucclecote]] Secondary School, which Heather and her siblings attended, are also known to have expressed concern as to why Heather\u2014a studious and obedient pupil\u2014refused to obey orders either to change her clothing for, or shower after, sporting activities. On one occasion, she was forced to take a shower, resulting in her peers and staff noting her arms, legs and torso were covered in welts and bruises in various stages of healing.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=190}} Heather attempted to excuse these injuries as having been obtained in fights with her siblings, but confided in one close friend that they had been inflicted by her parents, adding that her mother considered her a \"little bitch\" who deserved her beatings.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=196}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose's sex life had reached several of the children's classmates, and although the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather confided to her friends that many of these rumours were true. The father of one of these classmates was a friend of the Wests; as such, word soon reached Fred and Rose that Heather had divulged details of her home life\u2014including details of her mother's promiscuity\u2014to her classmates. Fred was so concerned by these revelations that he began to escort Heather to and from school.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=194}}\n\nAfter Heather left school in 1986, she applied for numerous jobs in an effort to leave Cromwell Street. By June of the following year, she had pinned her hopes on escaping the household via obtaining a job as a [[chalet]] cleaner at a holiday camp in the seaside town of [[Torquay]]; she received notification that this application had been unsuccessful on 18 June. In response, she crumpled into tears before her siblings Mae and Stephen. That same evening, her whole family heard Heather sobbing aloud as she attempted to sleep,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=197}} and according to Mae, she \"cried all the way through the night.\" The following morning, on 19 June,{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=206}} Heather was \"back to her usual self, looking miserable, biting her nails and sitting on the couch bouncing back and forth as she sat\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} as her siblings left the house to go to school.\n\nWhen Heather's siblings returned home, they were informed Heather had left to accept the job she had previously been refused in Torquay, although Rose told an enquiring neighbour that she and Heather had had a \"hell of a row\", and that Heather had run away from home. Later, to answer their children's questions about why Heather failed to contact or visit her siblings, the parents claimed that Heather had eloped with a lesbian lover. When Mae and Stephen suggested they report Heather's disappearance to police, Fred changed his story yet again, saying it would be unwise to initiate a search for Heather as she was involved in [[credit card fraud]].{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=487}} On more than one occasion, Fred and Rose persuaded an unknown acquaintance to fake a phone call from Heather to her parents.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|pages=240\u2013241}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I mean Heather, I mean I thought the bloody world of Heather.

With Rose's approval, he later constructed a barbecue pit immediately opposite where Heather had been buried, and placed a pine table on her grave for the children of the family to sit upon whenever the Wests held family gatherings in their garden.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=235}}\n\nHeather's disappearance, Fred and Rose's constantly changing stories about their daughter's whereabouts, plus their allusions to foul play, ultimately led to police enquiries as to Heather's whereabouts. These enquiries culminated in a [[Search warrant#United Kingdom|search warrant]] being issued to excavate the Wests' garden in February 1994.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=227}}\n\n==Arrest==\nIn May 1992, Fred asked his 13-year-old daughter Louise to bring some bottles to a room on the first floor of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, \"No, don't!\" Later, Fred returned downstairs. Louise was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and [[sodomy|sodomised]] her, at one stage partially strangling her.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=18 }} When Rose returned home, Louise confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred; Rose replied, \"Oh well. You were asking for it.\" Over the following weeks, Louise was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, \"Well, what did you expect?\"{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=244}} Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, Louise garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend told her own mother what had happened on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.\n\nOn 6 August 1992, the police searched the West household on the pretext of searching for stolen property. Although numerous objects of sexual paraphernalia\u2014including 99 pornographic videos of both home-made and commercial nature\u2014were discovered, police did not find the video depicting the rape of Fred's daughter. The 13-year-old made a full statement through a specially-trained [[solicitor#England and Wales|solicitor]], describing her father's actions, the fact the sexual abuse had begun when she was 11, and that her mother had been casually indifferent to her plight. All the children in the household were placed in [[foster care]] the following day.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=19}} Medical examinations revealed evidence of physical and sexual abuse.{{refn|group=n|Journalist and author [[Howard Sounes]] has also claimed the younger West children were \"afflicted with [[Speech disorder|speech impediment]]s and [[Strabismus|squints]].\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=344}}}}\n\nThe West children also divulged their mother had inflicted most of the physical abuse and that their father frequently said that if they told anyone about the goings-on in the household they would be \"buried under the patio\" like their sister Heather.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=22}}\n\n===Investigation===\nPolice began a full-scale investigation, eventually leading to Fred being charged with three counts of rape, and one of [[buggery]], with Rose as an accomplice. She was also charged with [[child abuse|child cruelty]], [[incitement|inciting]] her husband to engage in sex with their daughter,{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=245}} and [[obstructing government administration|obstructing the police]]. Fred and Rose were questioned as to the whereabouts of their eldest daughter, and although Fred claimed Heather was \"alive and well\" and supporting herself via prostitution, Rose initially claimed to have no knowledge of Heather's whereabouts, or why she had left home. She claimed on 11 August that she could \"remember now\" that her daughter had left home at her own persuasion due to Rose's concerns her other children may discover Heather's supposed lesbian inclinations. Rose then added she had also given her daughter \u00a3600 to incentivise her to leave the household, before further claiming to have maintained sporadic telephone contact with her daughter over the years.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=221}} The following day, Rose was granted [[bail]] on the condition she did not maintain contact with her children, her stepdaughter, or her husband prior to her upcoming trial.\n\nAs Fred awaited trial, he was held on remand in [[Birmingham]]. Learning that her father had denied any wrongdoing, Anna Marie also contacted police to offer a full statement detailing her experiences as a child. In a statement given to [[Constable#United Kingdom|Detective Constable]] Hazel Savage, Anna Marie recounted the extensive physical, [[psychological abuse|mental]] and sexual abuse she had endured as a child at the hands of her father and stepmother, before agreeing to testify against both parents at their upcoming trial. Anna Marie also added she had, for several years, been unsuccessfully attempting to trace her mother Rena and half-sisters Charmaine and Heather. Further enquiries conducted with Anna Marie's husband, Chris Davis, revealed that Heather had confided in him just how unhappy she was shortly before her disappearance, and of her desire to leave home. Davis elaborated that although Heather had not divulged any details about her enduring any sexual abuse, he had been so concerned for her welfare he had offered to confront Fred and Rose, and Heather had dissuaded him from doing so, blurting: \"For Christ's sake don't, because they'll kill us both!\" Davis then suggested they might wish to speak with Heather to garner further details of her abuse.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=217}}\n\nIn their efforts to gather further evidence, police and social services also spoke with Mae, who, having spoken with her 13-year-old sister and learned Louise did not wish to see her father charged, initially denied she had endured any molestation as an adolescent.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=26}} Police then focused their attentions on tracing Heather in efforts to corroborate Anna Marie's claims of sexual abuse, but enquiries to the [[Inland Revenue]] and the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Social Security department]] held no records attesting to her being alive. Two months later, Gloucester social services also contacted police to stress their concern over the whereabouts of Heather.\n\nThis case against the Wests collapsed when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister Louise declined to testify at the court case on 7 June 1993, with the child rape victim expressing her desire to return to her family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement because of her noting the misery of her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose's vindictiveness.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=20 }} Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.\n\n===Search warrant===\nAlthough the Wests were [[acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges, all their younger children remained in foster care, albeit with permitted [[supervised visitation]]s to Cromwell Street. Despite Fred and Rose claiming to the few relatives from whom they were not already [[family estrangement|estranged]] by 1993 that the charges had been fabricated by police, almost all of their remaining family members severed contact with them.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=229}} Meanwhile, police continued investigating the disappearance of Heather, noting no records existed indicating she was still alive. When Anna Marie was questioned as to the colloquial \"family joke\" regarding Heather being buried beneath the patio, she confirmed that the sole time she had heard her father recite this claim, he had immediately burst into laughter, leading to her refusing to take this claim seriously.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=28}}\n\nIn retracing Fred's history, police also discovered that although Rena and Charmaine had disappeared in 1971, no [[missing person]] report had ever been filed on either of them. DC Savage and her colleagues were convinced Heather was dead, and that Fred's repeated statement to his children that her body lay beneath the family patio might be true. On 23 February 1994, Gloucester police successfully applied for a search warrant authorising the search of 25 Cromwell Street to locate Heather's remains.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=528}}\n\nWhen police displayed this warrant to Rose on 24 February, she turned pale, before becoming hysterical and shouting over her shoulder to her eldest son, Stephen, \"Get Fred!\"{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=2 }} Rose became contradictory in her informal questioning as to the circumstances surrounding Heather's disappearance. When reminded of these contradictions, she became distraught and abusive, shouting at the officers: \"I can't fucking remember! It's a bloody long time ago! What do you think I am? A bloody computer?\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=32}}\n\nFred had been working in [[Stroud]] at the time; upon hearing of the police's intentions, he assured Stephen he would be home immediately. When Fred arrived three hours later, he informed his family of his intention to voluntarily offer a [[witness statement]] to police regarding his daughter's whereabouts.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3 }} Despite Fred's insistence in this statement that Heather had been \"alive and well\", albeit involved in a [[drug cartel|drugs cartel]], and that the claims he and his wife had made as to Heather being buried beneath the family patio were simply \"rubbish\", police were unassuaged. In response, Fred abruptly changed tactics, claiming they simply held a grudge against him due to his 1993 acquittal of the rape of his daughter.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3}}\n\nThat evening, with the search team having left their premises and a uniformed officer remaining at Cromwell Street to guard the [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation site]], Mae and Stephen observed their parents talking in hushed tones as they repeatedly glanced towards the garden from their kitchen window.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=236}}\n\n==Discoveries==\n\n===Arrest of Fred West===\nIn the early hours of the following morning, as his son Stephen was about to leave for work, Fred informed him: \"Look son, look after mum and sell the house [...] I've done something really bad. I want you to go to the papers and make as much money as you can.\"{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=3 }} Shortly thereafter, police returned to Cromwell Street to continue their search for Heather's body. Upon their arrival, Fred indicated his wish to be arrested for Heather's murder and to be taken to Bearland police station to provide a full confession; he was then arrested and formally [[police caution|cautioned]].{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=32}}\n\nAt 11:15 that morning, Fred formally admitted to police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit in an act of [[manslaughter]]. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage, then dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=22 }} Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed [[appropriate adult]], Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]], before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.\n\nThe following day (26 February), police began excavating the section of the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had buried his daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human [[femur|thigh bone]] protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating the section of the garden where Fred had indicated he had buried his daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, with one kneecap and several phalange bones missing.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=244}} The decedent's fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via [[forensic dentistry|dental records]] as being that of Heather West.\n\nThat evening, having been formally charged with his daughter's murder and questioned as to why police had also discovered a third thigh bone, Fred confessed there were two further sets of human remains in his garden, and agreed to return to Cromwell Street to reveal the locations of both graves; one of whom he named as Shirley Robinson, whom he described as being a former tenant and a lesbian who had been heavily pregnant with his child at the time of her 1978 murder;{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=185}} the other victim he described (incorrectly) as being \"Shirley's mate\", but either could not or would not elaborate as to her identity. Both sets of remains were discovered on 28 February, and Fred was charged with both murders two days later.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=249}}\n\nHaving discovered three sets of human remains in the garden, a decision was made to thoroughly search the entire property. Rose was placed into a [[safe house]] in the nearby town of [[Dursley]] as police commenced their search inside 25 Cromwell Street. Informed of this fact, and with the formal interviews conducted by the investigative team lasting up to 16 hours each day and including persistent questioning as to the whereabouts of his first wife Rena and stepdaughter Charmaine,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=249}} Fred authorised his solicitor to pass a note he had written to the leader of the murder investigation: [[Superintendent (police)#United Kingdom|Superintendent]] John Bennett of the Gloucestershire Police. This note read: \"I, Frederick West, authorise my solicitor, Howard Ogden, to advise Superintendent Bennett that I wish to admit a further (approx) nine killings, expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified. F. West.\"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=48}}\n\nQuestioned further as to his claims, Fred calmly explained there were a further five bodies buried in his cellar, and a sixth body beneath the ground-floor bathroom. Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls he had murdered in the 1970s after picking them up at bus stops. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, and that he had transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubical graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate precisely where he had buried each victim.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=251}}\n\nBetween 5 and 8 March, police found six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been extensively mutilated, and each body bore evidence of having been subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=167}} Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an effort to allow her to breathe prior to her murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=255}} Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones; when questioned, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=549}}\n\n===Arrest of Rose West===\nDespite Fred's insistence that his wife held no knowledge of any of the murders,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=267}} investigators suspected otherwise. Rose was arrested on 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy\u2014both charges dating from the mid-1970s. The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to [[HM Prison Ashfield|Pucklechurch Prison]] to be held in the maximum security wing. Here, she was questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter Heather and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough's murder.\n\nBy 6 May, Fred and Rose were jointly charged with five counts of murder, with Rose simply replying, \"I'm innocent\" upon hearing each formal charge - a response that proved to be a theme throughout each of the 46 interviews investigators held with Rose prior to her trial.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=549}}\n\nAs well as the murders of the victims exhumed from Cromwell Street, Fred had confessed to the murders of his first wife and stepdaughter, and to knowing the location of Anne McFall's remains (although he always denied killing her). Fred agreed to identify each burial location, and the remains were unearthed between 10 April and 7 June.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=22}} He was then transferred to Birmingham's [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green Prison]], where a strict [[suicide watch]] called for his cell to be checked every 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/west-believed-suicide-would-save-rosemary-1328315.html|title=West Believed Suicide Would Save Rosemary|access-date=29 December 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 July 1996}}</ref>\n\n==Formal charges==\nFred and Rose West were brought before a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; he was charged with 11 murders and she with nine.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=276}} This was the first time the couple had seen each other since Fred's February arrest. Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred leaned toward his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose\u2014having ignored her husband's presence\u2014visibly winced in discomfort.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=272}} Both were ordered held on [[detention of suspects|remand]].\n\nAs police attempted to lead Fred from the hearing, he resisted their efforts, and again attempted to move towards Rose, who again winced and attempted to writhe away from his grasp.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|page=214}}\n\nImmediately after this court appearance, Fred was re-arrested on suspicion of murdering Anne McFall, whose body had been found on 7 June but had not been officially identified until this date; he was formally charged with McFall's murder on 3 July, appearing in court the following morning.{{sfn|Burn|1998|pages=440\u2013441}}\n\n===Diversion of culpability===\nAs he was held on remand at Winson Green Prison in the months following his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed. This became worse after Rose's public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter to her husband and in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him.\n\nFred pleaded with Stephen and Anna Marie (the only children to visit their father while on remand) to convey to Rose that he loved her, but Rose never acknowledged these overtures. In response, Fred withdrew his earlier confessions to having acted alone in the murders, and instead accused his wife of almost total [[culpability]] in all the murders to which he had been charged, excluding that of Anne McFall, which he claimed had been committed by his first wife.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=13}}\n\n==Death==\n{{quote box\n| quote = To Rose West, Steve and Mae,\n\nWell Rose it's your birthday on 29 November 1994 and you will be 41 and still beautiful and still lovely and I love you.

He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred's sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner.\n\nAgainst the advice of her counsel, Rose herself testified; her affect sometimes morose and tearful, sometimes upbeat and humorous. She wept while describing herself as a victim of child abuse and rape who naively married a violent and domineering man, but joked about issues such as her \"always being pregnant\",{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=310}} and laughed while describing one victim's \"grandfather glasses\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=310}} She also claimed never to have met six of the victims buried at Cromwell Street, and to recall very little of her assault on Caroline Owens. When shown photographs of the victims buried in the cellar and victim Alison Chambers and asked by Brian Leveson whether she recognised any of their faces, Rose's face turned bright red, and she repeatedly stuttered as she replied, \"No, sir.\"{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=311}}\n\nWhen questioned as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose claimed she and Fred had lived separate lives, which was inconsistent with the earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at their address.{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996 |page=36}} In reference to her relationship with her eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained, before claiming to the court that her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after she had left home.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe defence next called a succession of women who claimed to have been attacked or assaulted by a lone male whose physical description matched that of Fred West between 1966 and 1975. These seven women each testified they had recognised their attacker as Fred West when his photograph appeared in the media in 1994. The intention of this testimony was to illustrate to the jury that Fred was capable of abducting, assaulting or attempting to attack women without Rose, which the prosecution had never disputed. The physical recollections of several of these women varied greatly.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Independent |location=UK | last = Bennett | first = Will | date = 3 November 1995 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/young-women-tell-of-attacks-by-fred-west-1537011.html | title = Young Women Tell of Attacks by Fred West | accessdate =16 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe final witness to testify at Rose's trial was Fred's appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, whom the prosecution had called to testify on 7 November in [[rebuttal]] to the tape recordings of Fred's confession which had been played to the court on 3 November and in which he had stressed Rose had \"known nothing at all\" about any of the murders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/chilling-tapes-let-court-into-mind-of-killer-1537155.html|title=Chilling Tapes Let Court into Mind of Killer|access-date=29 December 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 November 1995}}</ref> Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a [[confidant]]e, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a [[pact]] whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being \"some of Rose's mistakes\". He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. Fred had also confided that he had dismembered the victims, and Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, having personally removed Robinson's unborn child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had \"played a major part\" in these murders.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=324}}\n\nUpon cross examination, Leach did concede to Richard Ferguson she had earlier [[perjury|lied under oath]] about having sold her story to a national newspaper for \u00a3100,000, although she was adamant as to the sincerity of her testimony.

On several occasions, Fred made cryptic hints he had claimed several other victims, but refused to divulge any further information beyond that he had murdered 15-year-old Mary Bastholm in 1968 and buried the body on farmland near Bishop's Cleeve.

Much of this information was disjointed or told in a [[Third-person narrative|third party]] manner; Fred claimed that he had extensively tortured the victims prior to their murder, but had not raped them, instead engaging in acts of [[necrophilia]] with their bodies at or shortly after the point of death.{{sfn|Masters|1996|page=204}} He also claimed the reason many phalange bones had been missing from the victims' bodies was because the removal of their fingers and toes had been one of the forms of torture the victims had endured, with other torture methods including the extraction of their nails,{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=199}} acts of mutilation, and cigarettes being stubbed out on their bodies. Furthermore, the locations of almost all the burial sites of victims\u2014both discovered and undiscovered\u2014was symbolic to Fred, as each had been buried at or very close to the location he had lived in or worked at the time of the victim's murder.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=79}}\n\n===1967===\n* '''July''': Anne McFall, (18).

Costello is believed to have called on the Wests at 25 Midland Road to either enquire about or obtain custody of her two daughters in mid-to-late-August 1971. It is believed Fred killed Rena to avoid any investigation into Charmaine's whereabouts. She is believed to have been strangled to death by Fred before her extensively mutilated body was buried in Letterbox Field.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=119}}\n\n===1973===\n* c.

Following her disappearance, Gough's mother called at Cromwell Street to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts, only to note Rose had been wearing her daughter's clothes and slippers. She was informed Lynda had moved to find work in [[Weston-super-Mare]]. Her remains were buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage, which was later converted into a bathroom.\n* '''10 November''': Carol Ann Cooper, (15). Cooper had been placed into care following her mother's death in 1966. She was last seen alive by her boyfriend in the suburb of Warndon boarding a bus to her grandmother's home.

Her precise date of death may have been one week after her disappearance, as Fred admitted himself into the casualty unit of the Gloucester Royal Hospital with a serious laceration of his right hand on 3 January, possibly sustained as he dismembered Partington's body.

Fred mistook her Swiss accent to be a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] one, and always referred to her as either \"the Dutch girl\" or \"Tulip\". She was reported missing to [[Scotland Yard]] by her family in Switzerland when communication from their daughter ceased.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=154}} Fred later further concealed Siegenthaler's remains by building a false [[chimney breast]] on her grave.\n* '''15 November''': Shirley Hubbard, (15).

In his subsequent confessions to police, Fred would refer to Mott as \"the girl from Newent\".{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=160}}\n\n===1978===\n* '''10 May''': Shirley Robinson, (18). Another former lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, Robinson had been [[bisexual]] and had engaged in casual sex with Fred and Rose. At the time of her disappearance, she had been eight months pregnant with Fred's child, and her baby had been due to be born on 11 June. No sexual motive existed for this murder, and the prosecution contended at Rose's trial that Robinson had been murdered as her pregnancy threatened the stability of the Wests' relationship.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=262}} Fred had originally planned to sell their baby to a childless couple and had photographs taken with Robinson for this purpose.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=178}}\n\n===1979===\n* '''5 August''': Alison Chambers, (16). Chambers had been placed into foster care at the age of 14, and had repeatedly absconded from Jordan's Brook House. She became acquainted with the Wests in mid-1979, and Fred later claimed to his solicitor that Chambers had died as a result of Rose becoming \"too bloody vicious\" with her. Her dismembered body, missing several bones and with a leather belt looped beneath her jaw and tied at the top of her head, was buried in the garden of Cromwell Street. This was the final murder where a sexual motive was established.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011|page=254}}\n\n===1987===\n* '''19 June''': Heather West, (16). Heather was likely to have been murdered because Fred and Rose considered her efforts to leave the household as a threat, as she divulged to her classmates the extensive physical and sexual abuse which occurred at Cromwell Street.{{sfn|Woodrow|2011}} Fred claimed he had not intended to kill his daughter, but carpet fibres found on two lengths of rope, discovered with her remains, suggested that she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Her body was dismembered with a heavy serrated knife and later buried in a hole in the garden which Fred had his son dig, under the pretence of installing a fish pond.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=199}} The 1994 police investigation into Heather's disappearance led to the discovery of her body, and the arrest of both her parents.\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n* As well as the 12 confirmed victims, police firmly believe Fred is also responsible for the 1968 disappearance of 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, but to date no body has been found.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fred West 'murder victim' petition rejected |date=6 January 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-16439869 |newspaper=BBC}}</ref> West's son, Stephen, has said he firmly believes the missing teenager was an early victim of his father, as Fred had openly boasted of having committed Bastholm's murder while on remand.

They believed they committed ten murders between 1971 and 1979, at least seven of which were for sexual purposes. Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978. They committed one further murder in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until they murdered their daughter in 1987. Police do not know of any further murders they committed before their 1994 arrest.\n\nDuring formal questioning, Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, indicating up to 18 other undiscovered victims.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/how-many-more-did-they-kill-1583214.html |title=How Many More did they Kill?|newspaper=The Independent |date= 23 November 1995|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nFred's remarkably relaxed, emotionally sterile attitude towards all aspects of his crimes startled many members of the enquiry team. This prompted Superintendent John Bennett to seek the assistance of a [[criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] for an expert opinion on Fred's state of mind. After analysing Fred's behaviour throughout the extensive 1994 interviews, psychologist Paul Britton advised Superintendent Bennett that Fred's blas\u00e9 manner indicated he had committed so many offences over such a long period that he was now indifferent to the acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Britton added that although an offender of this nature may come to offend less frequently, he would be unlikely to cease killing altogether.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=252}}\n\nOne theory which may explain the sudden lull in the frequency of their murders is the fact that by the mid-1970s, the Wests had begun a practice of befriending teenage girls from nearby care homes, many of whom they sexually abused, with others encouraged to engage in prostitution within their home.{{sfn|Burn|1998|page=412}} The Wests established acquaintances\u2014including several of their lodgers\u2014willing to partake in their shared fetishes, which may have satiated the couple to a degree.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/pasts-sadistic-gloucester-serial-killers-fred/story-24272090-detail/story.html |title=Pasts of Sadistic Gloucester Serial Killers Fred and Rose West to be Shown in Channel 5 Documentary |publisher=Somerset Live |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nCaroline Owens, Anna Marie West, and several other survivors of sexual assaults at the Wests' hands each testified at Rose's trial that she had been by far the more calculating, aggressive and controlling of the two. Owens stated that, at one stage in her ordeal, Fred said that they had abducted Owens primarily for Rose's gratification.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|pages=137\u2013138}} It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts\u2014willing or unwilling\u2014to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for their satisfaction.{{sfn|Sounes|1995|page=138}}\n\nFour young girls similar in age and physical characteristics to those Fred was later charged with murdering in Gloucestershire are known to have disappeared during the time Fred lived in Glasgow\u2014one of whom, Margaret McAvoy, Fred had been acquainted with. He had also rented a garden allotment adjacent to his house and which he frequently visited, although only a small section of this plot was ever [[horticulture|cultivated]]. To one neighbour, Fred remarked that he used the remainder for \"something special\", about which he refused to elaborate. Much of the supposed cultivation of this allotment occurred in the early hours of the morning.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/>\n\nPolice were unable to investigate whether any further bodies were buried at this location, as these allotments were built over in the 1970s as a section of the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]].{{sfn|Murder in Mind|1996|page=11}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nFred's body was [[cremation|cremated]] in [[Coventry]] on 29 March 1995.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). Reinforcements arrived on 4 November 1999 comprising 37 members of 3AFDS,<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.86.</ref> an integrated permanent and reserve squadron headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley (subsequently disbanded in December 2006). The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

ADGs continue to be deployed to the [[Middle East Area of Operations]] (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order.

These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

The U.S. and a coalition of six Caribbean nations attacked the island nation of [[Grenada]], {{convert|100|mi}} north of [[Venezuela]]. Codenamed '''Operation Urgent Fury''', the multinational intervention resulted in an allied victory within a matter of days. It was triggered by the strife within the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada [[Maurice Bishop]], and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with [[Hudson Austin]] as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.\n\nGrenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The Communist [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under [[Maurice Bishop]], suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September, 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's leadership performance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadapapers00ssou|title=The Grenada papers|date=1984|publisher=Institute for Contemporary Studies|others=Seabury, Paul., McDougall, Walter A., 1946-|isbn=0-917616-68-5|location=San Francisco, Calif.|oclc=11233840|url-access=registration}}</ref> Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed, but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party's Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known, Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still-disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop, his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. \n\nThe [[Reagan Administration]] in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]]. In addition, Grenada's Governor General [[Paul Scoon]] secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention, but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Survival for service : my experiences as Governor General of Grenada|last=Scoon, Paul, Sir, 1935-2013.|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=0-333-97064-0|location=Oxford, England|pages=136 and 145|oclc=54489557}}</ref> Reagan also acted due to \"concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island\" and fears of a repeat of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nThe invasion began on the morning of 25 October 1983, just two days after the bombing of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut]].

Austin's military government was deposed and replaced, with Scoon as Governor-General, by an interim advisory council until the 1984 elections.\n\nThe invasion was criticized by many countries including Canada.

The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The American government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean based on the {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]]. Such a facility would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet), and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31|title=Grenada : revolution and invasion|last=Payne, Anthony, 1952-|date=1984|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Sutton, Paul K., Thorndike, Tony.|isbn=0-312-35042-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31 31]|oclc=10548141}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Point Salines International Airport, Grenada]]\n\nIn 1983, Representative [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister. He described his findings before Congress:\n\n<blockquote>Based on my personal observations, discussion, and analysis of the new international airport under construction in Grenada, it is my conclusion that this project is specifically now and has always been for the purpose of economic development and is not for military use\u2026.

He said that the runway and the numerous fuel storage tanks were unnecessary for commercial flights, and that evidence indicated that the airport was to become a Cuban-Soviet forward military airbase.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12F6385D0C758EDDAA0894DB484D81&scp=20&sq=grenada&st=nyt|title=Grenada|last=Gailey|first=Phil|date=26 March 1983|work=New York Times|author2=Warren Weaver Jr.|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2009, the Grenadian government changed the name of Point Salines International Airport to [[Maurice Bishop International Airport]].<ref name=\"airport_rename1\">\n{{cite web\n | title= St. Vincent's Prime Minister to officiate at renaming of Grenada international airport\n | date= 26 May 2009\n | publisher= Caribbean Net News newspaper\n | url= http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-16694--32-32--.html\n}}\n{{dead link|date=November 2016}}\n</ref><ref name=\"airport_rename2\">\n{{cite web\n | title= Bishop's Honour: Grenada airport renamed after ex-PM\n | date= 30 May 2009\n | publisher= [[Caribbean News Agency]] (CANA)\n | url= http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html\n | url-status= dead\n | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090612200521/http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html\n | archive-date= 12 June 2009\n | df= dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== October 1983 ===\nOn 16 October 1983, Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power and placed Bishop under house arrest.

But the Rangers had to switch abruptly to a parachute landing when they learned mid-flight that the runway was obstructed. The air drop began at 05:30 on 25 October in the face of moderate resistance from [[ZU-23]] anti-aircraft guns and several BTR-60 APCs, which were knocked out by [[M67 recoilless rifle]] fire. [[AC-130]] gunships provided support for the landing. Cuban construction vehicles were commandeered to help clear the airfield, and one was even used to provide mobile cover for the Rangers as they moved to seize the heights surrounding the airfield.<ref name=Stuart>{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Richard W.|title=Operation Urgent Fury: The Invasion of Grenada, October 1983|date=2008|publisher=U.S. Army|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/grenada/urgent_fury.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThey cleared the airstrip of obstructions by 10 AM, and transport planes were able to land and unload additional reinforcements, including [[M151]] Jeeps and members of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]] who were assigned to guard the perimeter and detainees. Starting at 14:00, units began landing at Point Salines from the [[82nd Airborne Division]] under [[Edward Trobaugh]], including battalions of the [[325th Infantry Regiment]]. At 15:30, three BTR-60s of the Grenadian Army Motorized Company counter-attacked, but the Americans repelled them with recoilless rifles and an AC-130.<ref name=CombatReform>{{cite web|title=Turning the Tide: Operation Urgent Fury|url=http://www.combatreform.org/grenada.htm|website=Combat Reform|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers fanned out and secured the surrounding area, including negotiating the surrender of more than 100 Cubans in an aviation hangar. However, a Jeep-mounted Ranger patrol became lost searching for [[Saint George's University|True Blue Campus]] and was ambushed, with four killed. The Rangers eventually secured True Blue campus and its students, where they found only 140 students and were told that more were at another campus in Grand Anse. In all, the Rangers lost five men on the first day, but succeeded in securing Point Salines and the surrounding area.<ref name=Stuart />\n\n===Capture of Pearls Airport===\nA platoon of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 4 under Lieutenant Mike Walsh approached the beach near [[Pearls Airport]] around midnight on 24 October after evading patrol boats and overcoming stormy weather. They found that the beach was undefended but unsuitable for an amphibious landing. The 2nd Battalion of the [[8th Marine Regiment]] then landed south of Pearls Airport using [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] and [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters at 05:30 on 25 October; they captured Pearls Airport, encountering only light resistance, including a [[DShK]] machine gun which a Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] destroyed.<ref name=Kreisher>{{cite web|last1=Kreisher|first1=Otto|title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation}}</ref>\n\n===Raid on Radio Free Grenada===\n[[UH-60 Blackhawk]] helicopters delivered [[SEAL Team 6]] operators in the early morning of 25 October to Radio Free Grenada with the purpose of using the radio station for [[PsyOps|psychological operations]]. They captured the station unopposed and destroyed the radio transmitter. However, they were attacked by Grenadian forces in cars and an armored personnel carrier (APC), which forced the lightly armed SEALs to cut a fence and retreat into the ocean as they received fire from the APC. The SEALs swam to the [[USS Caron]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public2.nhhcaws.local/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/caron--dd-970-.html|title=Caron (DD-970)|website=public2.nhhcaws.local|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref> At least two were seriously wounded and bleeding, one with a shoulder injury and the other with a calf injury.

The raid on Richmond Hill Prison lacked vital intelligence, including the fact that several anti-aircraft guns defended it, and that the prison was on a steep hill without room for a helicopter to land. Anti-aircraft fire wounded passengers and crew and forced one MH-60 helicopter to crash land, causing another helicopter to land next to it to protect the survivors. One pilot was killed, and the Delta Force operators had to be relieved by a Navy Sea King helicopter.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada : legacy of a flawed victory|last=Kukielski|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=66\u201368|oclc=1123182247}}</ref> The raid on Fort Rupert, however, was successful in capturing several leaders of the People's Revolutionary Government.<ref name=\"CombatReform\"/>\n\n===Mission to rescue Governor General Scoon===\n[[File:AH-1S firing cannon Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|A U.S. Army AH-1S Cobra attack helicopter opens fire on an enemy position]]\n\nThe last major special operation was a mission to rescue Governor General Scoon from his mansion in [[Saint George, Grenada]]. The mission departed late at 05:30 on 25 October from Barbados, resulting in the Grenadian forces being already aware of the invasion and they guarded Scoon closely. The SEAL team entered the mansion without opposition, but [[BTR-60]] armored personnel carriers counter-attacked and trapped the SEALs and the governor inside. [[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.\n\nAt 19:00 on 25 October, 250 Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.<ref name=\"Russell\" /> G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n=== Airstrikes ===\nNavy [[A-7 Corsair]]s and Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.<ref name=\"dtic\" />{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n==Second day of the invasion==\n[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Initial troop invasion areas]]\n\nGeneral Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.\n\n===Attack on the Cuban compound===\nEarly on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon who were mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\n===Rescue at Grand Anse===\nOn the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the Ranger Regiment mounted Marine [[CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus guards offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" /> A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by {{USS|Caron}} at 23:00.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\n==Third day of the invasion and after==\n[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]\n\nBy 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single [[BTR-60]] during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\nThe Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and USS ''Caron''. However, the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\nIn the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] {{convert|17|mi}} northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Outcome==\n[[File:CH46SeaKnight Grenada 1983.JPG|thumb|A Marine Corps [[Sea Knight]] helicopter sits on the beach after being disabled during the Grand Anse rescue on 26 October 1983]]\nOfficial U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October.

It was triggered by the strife within the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada [[Maurice Bishop]], and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with [[Hudson Austin]] as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.\n\nGrenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The Communist [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under [[Maurice Bishop]], suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September, 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's leadership performance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadapapers00ssou|title=The Grenada papers|date=1984|publisher=Institute for Contemporary Studies|others=Seabury, Paul., McDougall, Walter A., 1946-|isbn=0-917616-68-5|location=San Francisco, Calif.|oclc=11233840|url-access=registration}}</ref> Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed, but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party's Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known, Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still-disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop, his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. \n\nThe [[Reagan Administration]] in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]]. In addition, Grenada's Governor General [[Paul Scoon]] secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention, but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Survival for service : my experiences as Governor General of Grenada|last=Scoon, Paul, Sir, 1935-2013.|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=0-333-97064-0|location=Oxford, England|pages=136 and 145|oclc=54489557}}</ref> Reagan also acted due to \"concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island\" and fears of a repeat of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nThe invasion began on the morning of 25 October 1983, just two days after the bombing of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut]].

Austin's military government was deposed and replaced, with Scoon as Governor-General, by an interim advisory council until the 1984 elections.\n\nThe invasion was criticized by many countries including Canada.

The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The American government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean based on the {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]]. Such a facility would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet), and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31|title=Grenada : revolution and invasion|last=Payne, Anthony, 1952-|date=1984|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Sutton, Paul K., Thorndike, Tony.|isbn=0-312-35042-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31 31]|oclc=10548141}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Point Salines International Airport, Grenada]]\n\nIn 1983, Representative [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister.

[[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.\n\nAt 19:00 on 25 October, 250 Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.<ref name=\"Russell\" /> G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n=== Airstrikes ===\nNavy [[A-7 Corsair]]s and Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.<ref name=\"dtic\" />{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n==Second day of the invasion==\n[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Initial troop invasion areas]]\n\nGeneral Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.\n\n===Attack on the Cuban compound===\nEarly on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon who were mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\n===Rescue at Grand Anse===\nOn the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the Ranger Regiment mounted Marine [[CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus guards offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" /> A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by {{USS|Caron}} at 23:00.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\n==Third day of the invasion and after==\n[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]\n\nBy 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single [[BTR-60]] during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\nThe Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and USS ''Caron''. However, the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\nIn the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] {{convert|17|mi}} northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Outcome==\n[[File:CH46SeaKnight Grenada 1983.JPG|thumb|A Marine Corps [[Sea Knight]] helicopter sits on the beach after being disabled during the Grand Anse rescue on 26 October 1983]]\nOfficial U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October.

The Soviet Union said that Grenada had been the object of United States threats, that the invasion violated international law, and that no small nation would find itself safe if the aggression were not rebuffed.

The show ran from 1969 to 1982 on [[BBC2]]. There were six series in all, the first five numbered from ''Q5'' to ''Q9'', and a final series titled ''There's a Lot of It About''. The first and third series ran for seven episodes, and the others for six episodes, each of which was 30 minutes long.\n\nVarious reasons have been suggested for the title. One possibility is that it was inspired by the project to construct the Cunard liner [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|QE2]], launched in September 1967, which was previously codenamed ''Q4''. Another theory is that Milligan was inspired by the BBC 6-point technical quality scale of the time, where \"Q5\" was severe degradation to picture or sound, and \"Q6\" was complete loss of sound or vision. This was extended by some engineering departments to a 9-point scale, finishing at \"Q9\".

Spike Milligan's ''Q5'' was missed...when we first saw ''Q5'' we were very depressed because we thought it was what we wanted to do and Milligan was doing it brilliantly. But nobody really noticed ''Q5''\". [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Terry Gilliam]] concurred. Jones noted that \"watching ''Q5'', we almost felt as if our guns had been Spiked! We had been writing quickies or sketches for some three years and they always had a beginning, a middle and a tag line. Suddenly, watching Spike Milligan, we realized that they didn't have to be like that\".<ref name=\"ScudamoresMilliganbio\"/>\n\nAlso, in the Pythons' (2004) autobiography, Cleese cites a conversation between himself and Terry Jones: \"We both happened to watch Spike Milligan's ''Q5'', and one or the other of us phoned up and said kind of jokingly but also rather anxiously, 'I thought that's what we were supposed to be doing?' And the other one said, 'That's what I thought too.' We felt that Spike had got to where we were trying to get to, but if you'd asked us the previous day, we couldn't have described very well what that was. However, when we saw it on the screen we recognised it, and in a way the fact that Spike had gone there probably enabled us to go a little bit further than we would otherwise have gone\" (p.&nbsp;191).<ref name=\"PythonsbythePythons\">Chapman, G., Cleese, J., Gilliam, T., Idle, E., Jones, T., & Palin, M.

London: Orion. {{ISBN|0-7528-6425-4}} Chapman's posthumous input via collateral sources</ref>\n\nIn the Python autobiography, Michael Palin mentions meeting their directors. \"One was [[Ian MacNaughton]], director of the Spike Milligan ''Q5'' series which we all thought was one of the best comedy shows on TV and certainly the most far ahead...\" (p.&nbsp;218).<ref name= PythonsbythePythons/> He describes himself and Terry Jones as being so impressed with the ''Q...'' show that they specifically sought out McNaughton to direct their own series.<ref name=\" MilliganHisPartInOurLives\" /><ref name= PythonsbythePythons />\n\n==Development==\nWhile ''Flying Circus'' had four series between 1969\u20131974, because of Milligan's tempestuous relationship with the BBC, he had to wait until 1975 for his second series, '''''Q6''''', to be commissioned. The series continued sporadically after this. '''''Q7''''' appeared in 1977, '''''Q8''''' shortly after in 1978 (two years before the [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]] registered the trademark; the TV series' opening credits showed the characters 'Q8' being formed from the word 'Kuwait'), '''''Q9''''' in 1980 and '''''There's a Lot of It About''''' in 1982. Milligan resented the BBC for the cold attitude they took towards the series in comparison with series like ''Flying Circus'', and always maintained that, given the opportunity, he would have produced more.  The shows were written by Milligan and his writing collaborator [[Neil Shand]], with occasional episodes (especially in later years) giving \"additional contribution\" credit to any or all of [[David Renwick]], [[Andrew Marshall (screenwriter)|Andrew Marshall]] and [[John Antrobus]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n''Q'' gave centre stage to Milligan's freeform surreal wit. The sketches came thick and fast, running into one another, making outrageous leaps from one subject or location to another and often stopping with no apparent conclusion. Even the costumes were madcap and contradictory \u2014 in some episodes each of them still bore its BBC Wardrobe Department tag \u2014 and Milligan seemed to have a fondness for large noses and hats.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nHowever, Milligan was criticised for his tendency to make [[Race (human classification)|racially]] charged jokes, especially regarding [[Jew]]s and [[Pakistan]]is, and the series as a whole was decidedly risqu\u00e9 even by the standards of the 1970s \u2014 almost every episode featured an appearance by the scantily-clad, huge-breasted \"glamour stooge\" [[Julia Breck]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Surviving episodes==\n34 of the 38 \"Q\" episodes still exist.  Through the mid-1970s, the BBC had a policy of [[wiping]] master copies of previously aired shows in order to reuse the videotape, or disposing of master videotapes altogether in order to reduce storage costs.  This affected series ''Q5'', as four of the seven episodes are now lost, and another two exist as black-and-white telerecordings only.  However, all of ''Q6'' exists, as does all of ''Q7, Q8, Q9'' and ''There's A Lot of It About''.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nOnly three episodes of ''Q5'' still exist. Episodes 2 and 3 both survive as 16mm black and white tele-recordings. Episode 4 exists in colour in its original form, and a few short clips from this colour episode appeared on the documentary ''Heroes of Comedy: Spike Milligan'', and again on BBC4's \"Assorted Q\" in December 2014.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Guests==\nMost of the episodes featured a relatively 'straight' musical interlude, sometimes performed by Milligan himself, or his collaborators [[Ed Welch]] or [[Alan Clare]] at the piano. There were also appearances by jazz groups, ragtime bands, singer-songwriters and the Mike Sammes Singers, who received custard pies in their faces at the end of one performance. Some of the musical clips were included in the [[BBC Four]] series ''Jazz Britannia''.\n\n==Regular cast members==\n*[[Julia Breck]]\n*[[John Bluthal]]\n*[[Alan Clare]]\n*[[Jeannette Charles]]\n*[[Robert Dorning]]\n*[[Linzi Drew]]\n*[[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]\n*[[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]]\n*[[Chris Langham]]\n*[[David Rappaport]]\n*[[Keith Smith (actor)|Keith Smith]]\n*[[Stella Tanner]]\n*[[Bob Todd]]\n*[[Rita Webb]]\n*[[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]]\n\n==DVD releases==\nVolume One (containing the first three series) was released on 21 November 2016,<ref>{{Citation|title=Q Volume 1 Series 1-3|date=2016-11-21|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/1-3-Q5-Q6-Q7-DVD/dp/B01LYSRT1V|publisher=Simply Media|accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> Followed by Volume Two (containing the fourth and fifth series) which was released on 27 February 2017.\n\nA 5-disc DVD Collection (consisting the complete second to fifth series, along with all 3 surviving episodes of the first) was released on 20 November 2017.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Carpenter, Humphrey.

Spike Milligan's ''Q5'' was missed...when we first saw ''Q5'' we were very depressed because we thought it was what we wanted to do and Milligan was doing it brilliantly. But nobody really noticed ''Q5''\". [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Terry Gilliam]] concurred. Jones noted that \"watching ''Q5'', we almost felt as if our guns had been Spiked! We had been writing quickies or sketches for some three years and they always had a beginning, a middle and a tag line. Suddenly, watching Spike Milligan, we realized that they didn't have to be like that\".<ref name=\"ScudamoresMilliganbio\"/>\n\nAlso, in the Pythons' (2004) autobiography, Cleese cites a conversation between himself and Terry Jones: \"We both happened to watch Spike Milligan's ''Q5'', and one or the other of us phoned up and said kind of jokingly but also rather anxiously, 'I thought that's what we were supposed to be doing?' And the other one said, 'That's what I thought too.' We felt that Spike had got to where we were trying to get to, but if you'd asked us the previous day, we couldn't have described very well what that was. However, when we saw it on the screen we recognised it, and in a way the fact that Spike had gone there probably enabled us to go a little bit further than we would otherwise have gone\" (p.&nbsp;191).<ref name=\"PythonsbythePythons\">Chapman, G., Cleese, J., Gilliam, T., Idle, E., Jones, T., & Palin, M. (2004). Edited by Bob McCabe. ''The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons''. London: Orion. {{ISBN|0-7528-6425-4}} Chapman's posthumous input via collateral sources</ref>\n\nIn the Python autobiography, Michael Palin mentions meeting their directors. \"One was [[Ian MacNaughton]], director of the Spike Milligan ''Q5'' series which we all thought was one of the best comedy shows on TV and certainly the most far ahead...\" (p.&nbsp;218).<ref name= PythonsbythePythons/> He describes himself and Terry Jones as being so impressed with the ''Q...'' show that they specifically sought out McNaughton to direct their own series.<ref name=\" MilliganHisPartInOurLives\" /><ref name= PythonsbythePythons />\n\n==Development==\nWhile ''Flying Circus'' had four series between 1969\u20131974, because of Milligan's tempestuous relationship with the BBC, he had to wait until 1975 for his second series, '''''Q6''''', to be commissioned. The series continued sporadically after this. '''''Q7''''' appeared in 1977, '''''Q8''''' shortly after in 1978 (two years before the [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]] registered the trademark; the TV series' opening credits showed the characters 'Q8' being formed from the word 'Kuwait'), '''''Q9''''' in 1980 and '''''There's a Lot of It About''''' in 1982. Milligan resented the BBC for the cold attitude they took towards the series in comparison with series like ''Flying Circus'', and always maintained that, given the opportunity, he would have produced more.  The shows were written by Milligan and his writing collaborator [[Neil Shand]], with occasional episodes (especially in later years) giving \"additional contribution\" credit to any or all of [[David Renwick]], [[Andrew Marshall (screenwriter)|Andrew Marshall]] and [[John Antrobus]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n''Q'' gave centre stage to Milligan's freeform surreal wit. The sketches came thick and fast, running into one another, making outrageous leaps from one subject or location to another and often stopping with no apparent conclusion. Even the costumes were madcap and contradictory \u2014 in some episodes each of them still bore its BBC Wardrobe Department tag \u2014 and Milligan seemed to have a fondness for large noses and hats.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nHowever, Milligan was criticised for his tendency to make [[Race (human classification)|racially]] charged jokes, especially regarding [[Jew]]s and [[Pakistan]]is, and the series as a whole was decidedly risqu\u00e9 even by the standards of the 1970s \u2014 almost every episode featured an appearance by the scantily-clad, huge-breasted \"glamour stooge\" [[Julia Breck]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Surviving episodes==\n34 of the 38 \"Q\" episodes still exist.  Through the mid-1970s, the BBC had a policy of [[wiping]] master copies of previously aired shows in order to reuse the videotape, or disposing of master videotapes altogether in order to reduce storage costs.  This affected series ''Q5'', as four of the seven episodes are now lost, and another two exist as black-and-white telerecordings only.  However, all of ''Q6'' exists, as does all of ''Q7, Q8, Q9'' and ''There's A Lot of It About''.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nOnly three episodes of ''Q5'' still exist. Episodes 2 and 3 both survive as 16mm black and white tele-recordings. Episode 4 exists in colour in its original form, and a few short clips from this colour episode appeared on the documentary ''Heroes of Comedy: Spike Milligan'', and again on BBC4's \"Assorted Q\" in December 2014.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Guests==\nMost of the episodes featured a relatively 'straight' musical interlude, sometimes performed by Milligan himself, or his collaborators [[Ed Welch]] or [[Alan Clare]] at the piano. There were also appearances by jazz groups, ragtime bands, singer-songwriters and the Mike Sammes Singers, who received custard pies in their faces at the end of one performance. Some of the musical clips were included in the [[BBC Four]] series ''Jazz Britannia''.\n\n==Regular cast members==\n*[[Julia Breck]]\n*[[John Bluthal]]\n*[[Alan Clare]]\n*[[Jeannette Charles]]\n*[[Robert Dorning]]\n*[[Linzi Drew]]\n*[[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]\n*[[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]]\n*[[Chris Langham]]\n*[[David Rappaport]]\n*[[Keith Smith (actor)|Keith Smith]]\n*[[Stella Tanner]]\n*[[Bob Todd]]\n*[[Rita Webb]]\n*[[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]]\n\n==DVD releases==\nVolume One (containing the first three series) was released on 21 November 2016,<ref>{{Citation|title=Q Volume 1 Series 1-3|date=2016-11-21|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/1-3-Q5-Q6-Q7-DVD/dp/B01LYSRT1V|publisher=Simply Media|accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> Followed by Volume Two (containing the fourth and fifth series) which was released on 27 February 2017.\n\nA 5-disc DVD Collection (consisting the complete second to fifth series, along with all 3 surviving episodes of the first) was released on 20 November 2017.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Carpenter, Humphrey.
