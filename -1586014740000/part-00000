GCSEs were the brainchild of Sir [[Keith Joseph]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]], believing they lacked rigour, fiercely opposed them. However, opposition to the new exams from the teaching unions persuaded her to introduce them immediately, purely so as not to appear weak. Although Gove had sought but failed to replace them, his special advisor, [[Dominic Cummings]], described the 1986 decision as catastrophic, leading to a collapse in the integrity of the exam system.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4309304.ece |title=Thatcher introduced GCSEs to spite the teaching unions |newspaper=The Times |last= Sanderson|first= David |date=30 December 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2015 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|primary and secondary-school national curricula]] for England would be restructured, and that study of authors such as [[Byron]], [[Keats]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] would be reinstated in English lessons as part of a plan to improve children's grasp of [[English literature]] and [[English language|language]]. [[Academy (English school)|Academies]] are not required to follow the national curriculum, and so would not be affected by the reforms. Children who fail to write coherently and grammatically, and who are weak in spelling, would be penalised under new examinations. Historian [[Simon Schama]] would give advice to government to ensure that pupils learnt Britain's \"island story\". Standards in mathematics and science would also be strengthened. He said that this was needed because [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideologues had undermined education. Theirs was the view, he thought, that schools \"shouldn't be doing anything so old-fashioned as passing on knowledge, requiring children to work hard, or immersing them in anything like dates in history or times tables in mathematics. These ideologues may have been inspired by generous ideals but the result of their approach has been countless children condemned to a prison house of ignorance\".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8043872/Conservative-Part-Conference-schoolchildren-ignorant-of-the-past-says-Gove.html |title=Conservative Party Conference: schoolchildren 'ignorant of the past', says Gove |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |first=Graeme |last=Paton}}</ref>\n\nIn a November 2010 [[white paper]], Gove declared reforms would include the compulsory study of foreign languages up to the age of sixteen years, a shake-up of league tables in which schools are ranked higher for the number of pupils taking GCSEs<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12914964 |work=BBC News |title= 'Gaming' the school league tables? |date=31 March 2011}}</ref> in five core subjects (English, mathematics, science, a language and one of the humanities), and the introduction of targets for primary schools.

However, opposition to the new exams from the teaching unions persuaded her to introduce them immediately, purely so as not to appear weak. Although Gove had sought but failed to replace them, his special advisor, [[Dominic Cummings]], described the 1986 decision as catastrophic, leading to a collapse in the integrity of the exam system.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4309304.ece |title=Thatcher introduced GCSEs to spite the teaching unions |newspaper=The Times |last= Sanderson|first= David |date=30 December 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2015 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|primary and secondary-school national curricula]] for England would be restructured, and that study of authors such as [[Byron]], [[Keats]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] would be reinstated in English lessons as part of a plan to improve children's grasp of [[English literature]] and [[English language|language]]. [[Academy (English school)|Academies]] are not required to follow the national curriculum, and so would not be affected by the reforms. Children who fail to write coherently and grammatically, and who are weak in spelling, would be penalised under new examinations. Historian [[Simon Schama]] would give advice to government to ensure that pupils learnt Britain's \"island story\". Standards in mathematics and science would also be strengthened. He said that this was needed because [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideologues had undermined education. Theirs was the view, he thought, that schools \"shouldn't be doing anything so old-fashioned as passing on knowledge, requiring children to work hard, or immersing them in anything like dates in history or times tables in mathematics. These ideologues may have been inspired by generous ideals but the result of their approach has been countless children condemned to a prison house of ignorance\".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8043872/Conservative-Part-Conference-schoolchildren-ignorant-of-the-past-says-Gove.html |title=Conservative Party Conference: schoolchildren 'ignorant of the past', says Gove |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |first=Graeme |last=Paton}}</ref>\n\nIn a November 2010 [[white paper]], Gove declared reforms would include the compulsory study of foreign languages up to the age of sixteen years, a shake-up of league tables in which schools are ranked higher for the number of pupils taking GCSEs<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12914964 |work=BBC News |title= 'Gaming' the school league tables? |date=31 March 2011}}</ref> in five core subjects (English, mathematics, science, a language and one of the humanities), and the introduction of targets for primary schools.

Many Caucasian nations united in resistance to Russian imperial aspirations in what became known as the [[Caucasian War]]. Some of the earlier leaders of [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resistance were [[Sheikh Mansur]] and [[Ghazi Mollah]]. Shamil was actually childhood friends with the Mollah, and would become his disciple and counsellor.\n\nShamil had multiple wives including one of Russian and Armenian heritage named [[Anna Ivanovna Ulykhanova]] (1828-1877).<ref name=\"Barrett\">Thomas M.

During this fight he was stabbed with a bayonet. After jumping from an elevated stoop \"clean over the heads of the very line of soldiers about to fire on him.  Landing behind them, whirling his sword in his left hand he cut down three of them, but was bayoneted by the fourth, the steel plunging deep in his chest. He seized the bayonet, pulled it out of his own flesh, cut down the man, and with another superhuman leap, cleared the wall and vanished in the darkness\".<ref>Invisible armies: Blanch, sabres(\"bare\":70; \"wild beast\"; al-Qarakhi, shining (pulled out sword: 22);</ref> He went into hiding and both Russia and Murids assumed him dead. Once recovered, he emerged from hiding and rejoined the Murids, led by the second [[Imam]], [[Gamzat-bek]]. He would wage unremitting warfare on the Russians for the next quarter century and become one of the legendary guerrilla commanders of the century. When Gamzat-bek was murdered by [[Hadji Murad]] in 1834, Shamil took his place as the prime leader of the Caucasian resistance and the third Imam of the Caucasian Imamate.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1839 (June\u2013August), Shamil and his followers, numbering about 4000 men, women and children, found themselves under siege in their mountain [[fortification|stronghold]] of [[Siege of Akhoulgo|Akhoulgo]], nestled in the bend of the [[Andi Koysu]], about ten miles east of [[Gimry]]. Under the command of General [[Pavel Grabbe]], the Russian army trekked through lands devoid of supplies because of Shamil's [[scorched-earth strategy]]. The geography of the stronghold protected it from three sides, adding to the difficulty of conducting the siege. Eventually the two sides agreed to negotiate. Complying with Grabbe's demands, Shamil gave his son, Jamaldin in a sign of good faith, as a hostage. Shamil rejected Grabbe's proposal that Shamil command his forces to surrender and for him to accept exile from the region. The Russian army attacked the stronghold, after 2 days of fighting, the Russian troops had secured it. Shamil escaped the siege during the first night of the attack. Shamil's forces had been broken and many Dagestani and Chechen chieftains proclaimed loyalty to the Tsar. Shamil fled Dagestan for Chechnya. There he made quick work of extending his influence over the clans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ghost of Freedom|last=King|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\nShamil was effective at uniting the many, quarrelsome Caucasian tribes to fight against the Russians, by the force of his charisma, piety and fairness in applying Sharia law. One Russian source commented on him as \"a man of great tact and a subtle politician.\" He believed the Russian introduction of alcohol in the area corrupted traditional values. Against the large regular Russian military, Shamil made effective use of irregular and guerrilla tactics. In 1845 an 8-10,000 strong column under the command of Count Michael Vorontsov followed the Imamate's forces into the forests of Chechnya. The Imamte's forces surround the Russian column, destroying it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gammer|first=Moshe|date=September 2013|title=Empire and Mountains: The Case of Russia and the Caucasus|url=|journal=Social Evolution & History|volume=|pages=124\u2013125|via=}}</ref>\n\nHis fortunes as a military leader rose after he was joined by Hadji Murad, who defected from the Russians in 1841 and tripled by his fighting the area under Shamil's control within a short time. Hadji Murad, who was to become the subject of [[Hadji Murat (novel)|a famous novella]] by [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1904), turned against Shamil a decade later, apparently disappointed by his failure to be anointed Shamil's successor as imam.

Many Caucasian nations united in resistance to Russian imperial aspirations in what became known as the [[Caucasian War]]. Some of the earlier leaders of [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resistance were [[Sheikh Mansur]] and Ghazi Mollah. Shamil was actually childhood friends with the Mollah, and would become his disciple and counsellor.\n\nShamil had multiple wives including one of Russian and Armenian heritage named Anna Ivanovna Ulykhanova (1828-1877).<ref name=\"Barrett\">Thomas M.

During this fight he was stabbed with a bayonet. After jumping from an elevated stoop \"clean over the heads of the very line of soldiers about to fire on him.  Landing behind them, whirling his sword in his left hand he cut down three of them, but was bayoneted by the fourth, the steel plunging deep in his chest.

Once recovered, he emerged from hiding and rejoined the Murids, led by the second [[Imam]], [[Gamzat-bek]]. He would wage unremitting warfare on the Russians for the next quarter century and become one of the legendary guerrilla commanders of the century. When Gamzat-bek was murdered by [[Hadji Murad]] in 1834, Shamil took his place as the prime leader of the Caucasian resistance and the third Imam of the [[Caucasian Imamate]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1839 (June\u2013August), Shamil and his followers, numbering about 4000 men, women and children, found themselves under siege in their mountain [[fortification|stronghold]] of [[Siege of Akhoulgo|Akhoulgo]], nestled in the bend of the [[Andi Koysu]], about ten miles east of Gimry.  Under the command of General Pavel Grabbe, the Russian army trekked through lands devoid of supplies because of Shamil's scorched-earth strategy. The geography of the stronghold protected it from three sides, adding to the difficulty of conducting the siege. Eventually the two sides agreed to negotiate. Complying with Grabbe's demands, Shamil gave his son, Jamaldin in a sign of good faith, as a hostage. Shamil rejected Grabbe's proposal that Shamil command his forces to surrender and for him to accept exile from the region. The Russian army attacked the stronghold, after 2 days of fighting, the Russian troops had secured it. Shamil escaped the siege during the first night of the attack. Shamil's forces had been broken and many Dagestani and Chechen chieftains proclaimed loyalty to the Tsar. Shamil fled Dagestan for Chechnya. There he made quick work of extending his influence over the clans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ghost of Freedom|last=King|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\nShamil was effective at uniting the many, quarrelsome Caucasian tribes to fight against the Russians, by the force of his charisma, piety and fairness in applying Sharia law. One Russian source commented on him as \"a man of great tact and a subtle politician.\" He believed the Russian introduction of alcohol in the area corrupted traditional values. Against the large regular Russian military, Shamil made effective use of irregular and guerrilla tactics. In 1845 an 8-10,000 strong column under the command of Count Michael Vorontsov followed the Imamate's forces into the forests of Chechnya. The Imamte's forces surround the Russian column, destroying it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gammer|first=Moshe|date=September 2013|title=Empire and Mountains: The Case of Russia and the Caucasus|url=|journal=Social Evolution & History|volume=|pages=124\u2013125|via=}}</ref>\n\nHis fortunes as a military leader rose after he was joined by Hadji Murad, who defected from the Russians in 1841 and tripled by his fighting the area under Shamil's control within a short time. Hadji Murad, who was to become the subject of [[Hadji Murat (novel)|a famous novella]] by Leo Tolstoy (1904), turned against Shamil a decade later, apparently disappointed by his failure to be anointed Shamil's successor as imam.

The song uncharacteristically was adopted by the [[Chabad]] movement (who usually compose their own melodies), as they take the deeper meaning of its stanzas as an analogy for the soul, which descends to a world of mortality and physicality, trapped in a body, knowing that it will one day return to its maker.<ref name=\":0\" /> (Another song uncharacteristically adapted by the [[Chabad]] movement is the tune of the [[La Marseillaise]], which was put to the tune of the prayer Ho'aderes V'hoemunah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2465274/jewish/The-Spiritual-French-Revolution-A-Miracle-in-Our-Times-5752-1992.htm#footnote20a2465274|title=The Spiritual French Revolution: A Miracle in Our Times, 5752(1992)|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> The French government altered the tune shortly later, in 1974, only to change it back in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marseillaise.org/english/background.html|title=La Marseillaise - background|website=www.marseillaise.org|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Grigol Robakidze]]. \"Imam Shamil\".

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThere were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe situation with the writers is more complex. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThere were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor). Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966. Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''. After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''. Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began early 1967.\n\nThe situation with the writers is more complex. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?
