They had intense dispassion for the world. \n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates if the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were Pravrajika Bharatiprana, Pravrajika Mokshaprana, Pravrajika Muktiprana, Pravrajika Dayaprana, Pravrajika Vidyaprana, Pravrajika Shraddhaprana, Pravrajika Bhaktiprana, and Pravrajika Medhaprana. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But by his love and grace, [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961.

Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines.

The latter refers to the large-scale abduction of women by groups of men, most frequently in a time of war (see also [[war rape]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The Latin term ''raptio'' refers to abduction of women, either for marriage (by [[kidnapping]] or [[elopement]]) or [[enslavement]] (particularly sexual slavery). In [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of [[matrimony]] if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|CIC]]).\n\nThe practice of ''raptio'' is surmised to have existed since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of a [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], unearthed the remains of numerous slain victims. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that perhaps the attackers had killed the men but abducted the young females.<ref>\nEisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die f\u00fcnf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in S\u00fcdwestdeutschland.''

It was particularly associated with accounts of women enslaved in Middle Eastern [[harem]]s, such as the so-called [[Circassian beauties]].<ref>Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850\u20131877'', University of Minnesota Press, 2005, pp. 68\u201388.</ref> The phrase gradually came to be used as a euphemism for prostitution.<ref>In the US this usage became prominent around 1909: \"a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or 'white slavery.' These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.\" Mark Thomas Connelly, ''The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era'', University of North Carolina Press, 1980, p. 114</ref> The phrase was especially common in the context of the exploitation of minors, with the implication that children and young women in such circumstances were not free to decide their own fates.\n\n[[File:The White Slave statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue entitled ''The White Slave'' by [[Abastenia St. Leger Eberle]], a controversial sculpture meant to depict modern western sexual enslavement]]\nIn [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], campaigning journalist [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', procured a 13-year-old girl for \u00a35, an amount then equal to a labourer's monthly wage (''see'' the [[Eliza Armstrong case]]). [[Moral panic]] over the \"traffic in women\" rose to a peak in England in the 1880s. At the time, \"white slavery\" was a natural target for defenders of public morality and crusading journalists. The ensuing outcry led to the passage of antislavery legislation in Parliament. Parliament passed the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act]], raising the [[age of consent]] from thirteen to sixteen in that year.<ref>\nCecil Adeams, \"The Straight Dope: [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1302/was-there-really-such-a-thing-as-white-slavery Was there really such a thing as \"white slavery\"?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020040134/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1302/was-there-really-such-a-thing-as-white-slavery |date=20 October 2008 }}\" 15 January 1999.\n</ref>\n\nA subsequent scare occurred in the United States in the early twentieth century, peaking in 1910, when [[Chicago]]'s [[U.S. attorney]] announced (without giving details) that an international crime ring was abducting young girls in Europe, importing them, and forcing them to work in Chicago [[brothel]]s. These claims, and the [[Moral panic|panic]] they inflamed, led to the passage of the United States [[Mann Act|White-Slave Traffic Act]] of 1910, generally known as the \"Mann Act\". It also banned the interstate transport of females for immoral purposes. Its primary intent was to address prostitution and immorality.<ref>Cecil Adams, ''op. cit.''</ref>\n\nImmigration inspectors at [[Ellis Island]] in New York City were held responsible for questioning and screening European prostitutes from the U.S. Immigration inspectors expressed frustration at the ineffectiveness of questioning in determining if a European woman was a prostitute, and claimed that many were \"lying\" and \"framing skillful responses\" to their questions. They were also accused of negligence should they accept a fictitious address from an immigrant or accept less-than-complete responses. Inspector Helen Bullis investigated several homes of assignment in the Tenderloin district of New York, and found brothels existed in the early 20th century in New York City.

As populations increased, slave women might be taken advantage of by white overseers, planter's younger sons before they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some were sold into brothels outright.\n\n''[[Pla\u00e7age]]'', a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or [[free people of color]], developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century. Young mixed-race women (considered highly desirable) would receive a dowry or property as part of an associated settlement negotiated by their mothers with white men. The fathers would often pay for education of their mixed-race children born of these unions, especially sons, who might be educated in France and enter the army. In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of quadroon balls and have referred to the institution of Pla\u00e7age as \"a myth\".<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies \u00bb quadroon balls|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002073440/http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark - Huffington Post|first1=Stacy Parker Le Melle Communications Director for the Afghan Women's Writing|last1=Project|first2=Author of 'Government Girl|last2=Young|first3=Female in the White|last3=House'|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002043533/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nBut Paul Heinegg's research showed that most mixed-race, [[free people of color|free black]] families in the censuses of 1790\u20131810 were descended from unions between free white women and African men, whether free, indentured servant or slave, that took place in colonial Virginia. It had half the slaves in the colonies at the time of the Revolution. In the early colonial years, the working class of indentured servants and slaves often worked and lived together.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995\u20132005</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th century, Virginia and other colonies passed laws determining the social status of children born in the colonies. Under English common law in England, children of two English subjects took the status of the father. But Africans were never considered English subjects. To settle the issue of the status of children born in the colony, Virginia passed a law in 1662 that ruled that children would take the status of their mother at birth, under the Roman legal principle known as ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]].'' Thus all children born to enslaved mothers were legally slaves, regardless of the paternity or ancestry of their fathers. They were bound for life and could be sold like any slave unless formally freed.\n\nThe term \"white slaves\" was sometimes used for those [[mixed-race]] or mulatto slaves who had a visibly high proportion of European ancestry. Among the most notable at the turn of the 19th century was [[Sally Hemings]], who was 3/4 white and believed by historians to be a half sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]] by their common father [[John Wayles]]. Hemings is known for having four surviving children from her decades-long concubinage with President [[Thomas Jefferson]]; they were 7/8 European by ancestry. Three of these mixed-race children passed easily into white society as adults (Jefferson freed them all \u2013 two informally and two in his will). Three of his Hemings grandsons served as white men in the Union Regular Army in the American Civil War; [[John Wayles Jefferson]] advanced to the rank of colonel.\n\nNot all white fathers abandoned their slave children; some provided them with education, apprenticeships, or capital; some wealthy planters sent their mixed-race children to the North for education and sometimes for freedom. Some men freed both their slave mistresses and their mixed-race children, especially in the 20 years after the American Revolution, but southern legislatures made such manumissions more difficult. Both [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote in the 19th century about the scandal of white men having their mistresses and natural [[mixed-race]] children as part of their extended households. Numerous mixed-race families were begun before the Civil War, and many originated in the Upper South.\n\nAfter slaves were emancipated, many states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], which prohibited [[interracial marriage]] between whites and non-whites. \n\n[[Zora Neale Hurston]] wrote about contemporary sexual practices in her [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies in the 1930s of the turpentine camps of North [[Florida]]. She noted that white men with power often forced black women into sexual relationships.\n\nAlthough she never named the practice as \"paramour rights,\" author C. Arthur Ellis ascribed this term to the fictionalized Hurston in his book, ''Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum.''<ref>Ellis, C. Arthur (Jr.). ''Zora Hurston And The Strange Case Of Ruby McCollum'' (Chattanooga, TN: Gadfly Publishing, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-9820940-0-6}}.</ref> The same character asserted that the death knell of paramour rights was sounded by the trial of [[Ruby McCollum]], a black woman who murdered Dr. C. Leroy Adams, in [[Live Oak, Florida]], in 1952. McCollum had testified that Adams forced her into sex and bearing his child. Journalist Hurston covered McCollum's trial in 1952 for the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''. McCollum's case was further explored in the 2015 documentary ''[[You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South]].''\n\nThe Chinese [[Tanka people|Tanka females]] were sold from [[Guangzhou]] to work as prostitutes for the overseas Chinese male community in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew |author2=Katharine Caroline Bushnell |title=Heathen Slaves and Christian Rulers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vv_qNljtPtUC&pg=PA13&dq=It+is+among+these+Tanka+women,+and+especially+under+the+protection+of+these+'+protected'+Tanka+women,+that+private+prostitution+and+the+sale+of+girls+for+concubinage+flourishes,+being+looked+upon+as+a+legitimate+profession#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20among%20these%20Tanka%20women%2C%20and%20especially%20under%20the%20protection%20of%20these%20'%20protected'%20Tanka%20women%2C%20that%20private%20prostitution%20and%20the%20sale%20of%20girls%20for%20concubinage%20flourishes%2C%20being%20looked%20upon%20as%20a%20legitimate%20profession&f=false |accessdate=31 October 2011  |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Echo Library |isbn=978-1-4068-0431-7 |page=13 |chapter= |quote= or among Chinese residents as their concubines, or to be sold for export to Singapore, San Francisco, or Australia. }}</ref> During the [[California Gold Rush]] in the late 1840s, Chinese merchants transported thousands of young Chinese girls, including babies, from China to the United States.

Until recently, very little was known about this apart from testimonies of retired generals and soldiers who had fought in the war. In February 2002, Korean sociologist [[Kim Kwi-ok]] wrote the first scholarly work on Korea's comfort women through official records.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 347</ref>\n\nThe South Korean \"comfort\" system was organized around three operations. First, there were \"special comfort units\" called T'uksu Wiandae (\ud2b9\uc218\uc704\uc548\ub300, \u7279\u6b8a\u6170\u5b89\u968a), which operated from seven different stations. Second, there were mobile units of comfort women that visited barracks. Third, there were prostitutes who worked in private brothels that were hired by the military. Although it is still not clear how recruitment of these comfort women were organized in the South, South Korean agents were known to have kidnapped some of the women from the North.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 215</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist [[Chunghee Sarah Soh]], the South Korean military's use of comfort women has produced \"virtually no societal response,\" despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean comfort women within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh argue that this system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these comfort women as \"military supplies\" in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of comfort women, viewing them as a \"necessary social evil\" that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 216</ref>\n\n==Present day==\nOfficial estimates of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary.

The latter refers to the large-scale abduction of women by groups of men, most frequently in a time of war (see also [[war rape]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The Latin term ''raptio'' refers to abduction of women, either for marriage (by [[kidnapping]] or [[elopement]]) or [[enslavement]] (particularly sexual slavery). In [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of [[matrimony]] if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|CIC]]).\n\nThe practice of ''raptio'' is surmised to have existed since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of a [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], unearthed the remains of numerous slain victims. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that perhaps the attackers had killed the men but abducted the young females.<ref>\nEisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die f\u00fcnf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in S\u00fcdwestdeutschland.''

It was particularly associated with accounts of women enslaved in Middle Eastern [[harem]]s, such as the so-called [[Circassian beauties]].<ref>Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850\u20131877'', University of Minnesota Press, 2005, pp. 68\u201388.</ref> The phrase gradually came to be used as a euphemism for prostitution.<ref>In the US this usage became prominent around 1909: \"a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or 'white slavery.' These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.\" Mark Thomas Connelly, ''The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era'', University of North Carolina Press, 1980, p. 114</ref> The phrase was especially common in the context of the exploitation of minors, with the implication that children and young women in such circumstances were not free to decide their own fates.\n\n[[File:The White Slave statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue entitled ''The White Slave'' by [[Abastenia St. Leger Eberle]], a controversial sculpture meant to depict modern western sexual enslavement]]\nIn [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], campaigning journalist [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', procured a 13-year-old girl for \u00a35, an amount then equal to a labourer's monthly wage (''see'' the [[Eliza Armstrong case]]). [[Moral panic]] over the \"traffic in women\" rose to a peak in England in the 1880s. At the time, \"white slavery\" was a natural target for defenders of public morality and crusading journalists. The ensuing outcry led to the passage of antislavery legislation in Parliament. Parliament passed the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act]], raising the [[age of consent]] from thirteen to sixteen in that year.<ref>\nCecil Adeams, \"The Straight Dope: [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1302/was-there-really-such-a-thing-as-white-slavery Was there really such a thing as \"white slavery\"?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020040134/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1302/was-there-really-such-a-thing-as-white-slavery |date=20 October 2008 }}\" 15 January 1999.\n</ref>\n\nA subsequent scare occurred in the United States in the early twentieth century, peaking in 1910, when [[Chicago]]'s [[U.S. attorney]] announced (without giving details) that an international crime ring was abducting young girls in Europe, importing them, and forcing them to work in Chicago [[brothel]]s. These claims, and the [[Moral panic|panic]] they inflamed, led to the passage of the United States [[Mann Act|White-Slave Traffic Act]] of 1910, generally known as the \"Mann Act\". It also banned the interstate transport of females for immoral purposes. Its primary intent was to address prostitution and immorality.<ref>Cecil Adams, ''op. cit.''</ref>\n\nImmigration inspectors at [[Ellis Island]] in New York City were held responsible for questioning and screening European prostitutes from the U.S. Immigration inspectors expressed frustration at the ineffectiveness of questioning in determining if a European woman was a prostitute, and claimed that many were \"lying\" and \"framing skillful responses\" to their questions. They were also accused of negligence should they accept a fictitious address from an immigrant or accept less-than-complete responses. Inspector Helen Bullis investigated several homes of assignment in the Tenderloin district of New York, and found brothels existed in the early 20th century in New York City.

As populations increased, slave women might be taken advantage of by white overseers, planter's younger sons before they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some were sold into brothels outright.\n\n''[[Pla\u00e7age]]'', a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or [[free people of color]], developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century. Young mixed-race women (considered highly desirable) would receive a dowry or property as part of an associated settlement negotiated by their mothers with white men. The fathers would often pay for education of their mixed-race children born of these unions, especially sons, who might be educated in France and enter the army. In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of quadroon balls and have referred to the institution of Pla\u00e7age as \"a myth\".<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies \u00bb quadroon balls|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002073440/http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark - Huffington Post|first1=Stacy Parker Le Melle Communications Director for the Afghan Women's Writing|last1=Project|first2=Author of 'Government Girl|last2=Young|first3=Female in the White|last3=House'|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002043533/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nBut Paul Heinegg's research showed that most mixed-race, [[free people of color|free black]] families in the censuses of 1790\u20131810 were descended from unions between free white women and African men, whether free, indentured servant or slave, that took place in colonial Virginia. It had half the slaves in the colonies at the time of the Revolution. In the early colonial years, the working class of indentured servants and slaves often worked and lived together.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995\u20132005</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th century, Virginia and other colonies passed laws determining the social status of children born in the colonies. Under English common law in England, children of two English subjects took the status of the father. But Africans were never considered English subjects. To settle the issue of the status of children born in the colony, Virginia passed a law in 1662 that ruled that children would take the status of their mother at birth, under the Roman legal principle known as ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]].'' Thus all children born to enslaved mothers were legally slaves, regardless of the paternity or ancestry of their fathers. They were bound for life and could be sold like any slave unless formally freed.\n\nThe term \"white slaves\" was sometimes used for those [[mixed-race]] or mulatto slaves who had a visibly high proportion of European ancestry. Among the most notable at the turn of the 19th century was [[Sally Hemings]], who was 3/4 white and believed by historians to be a half sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]] by their common father [[John Wayles]]. Hemings is known for having four surviving children from her decades-long concubinage with President [[Thomas Jefferson]]; they were 7/8 European by ancestry. Three of these mixed-race children passed easily into white society as adults (Jefferson freed them all \u2013 two informally and two in his will). Three of his Hemings grandsons served as white men in the Union Regular Army in the American Civil War; [[John Wayles Jefferson]] advanced to the rank of colonel.\n\nNot all white fathers abandoned their slave children; some provided them with education, apprenticeships, or capital; some wealthy planters sent their mixed-race children to the North for education and sometimes for freedom. Some men freed both their slave mistresses and their mixed-race children, especially in the 20 years after the American Revolution, but southern legislatures made such manumissions more difficult. Both [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote in the 19th century about the scandal of white men having their mistresses and natural [[mixed-race]] children as part of their extended households. Numerous mixed-race families were begun before the Civil War, and many originated in the Upper South.\n\nAfter slaves were emancipated, many states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], which prohibited [[interracial marriage]] between whites and non-whites. \n\n[[Zora Neale Hurston]] wrote about contemporary sexual practices in her [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies in the 1930s of the turpentine camps of North [[Florida]]. She noted that white men with power often forced black women into sexual relationships.\n\nAlthough she never named the practice as \"paramour rights,\" author C. Arthur Ellis ascribed this term to the fictionalized Hurston in his book, ''Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum.''<ref>Ellis, C. Arthur (Jr.). ''Zora Hurston And The Strange Case Of Ruby McCollum'' (Chattanooga, TN: Gadfly Publishing, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-9820940-0-6}}.</ref> The same character asserted that the death knell of paramour rights was sounded by the trial of [[Ruby McCollum]], a black woman who murdered Dr. C. Leroy Adams, in [[Live Oak, Florida]], in 1952. McCollum had testified that Adams forced her into sex and bearing his child. Journalist Hurston covered McCollum's trial in 1952 for the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''. McCollum's case was further explored in the 2015 documentary ''[[You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South]].''\n\nThe Chinese [[Tanka people|Tanka females]] were sold from [[Guangzhou]] to work as prostitutes for the overseas Chinese male community in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew |author2=Katharine Caroline Bushnell |title=Heathen Slaves and Christian Rulers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vv_qNljtPtUC&pg=PA13&dq=It+is+among+these+Tanka+women,+and+especially+under+the+protection+of+these+'+protected'+Tanka+women,+that+private+prostitution+and+the+sale+of+girls+for+concubinage+flourishes,+being+looked+upon+as+a+legitimate+profession#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20among%20these%20Tanka%20women%2C%20and%20especially%20under%20the%20protection%20of%20these%20'%20protected'%20Tanka%20women%2C%20that%20private%20prostitution%20and%20the%20sale%20of%20girls%20for%20concubinage%20flourishes%2C%20being%20looked%20upon%20as%20a%20legitimate%20profession&f=false |accessdate=31 October 2011  |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Echo Library |isbn=978-1-4068-0431-7 |page=13 |chapter= |quote= or among Chinese residents as their concubines, or to be sold for export to Singapore, San Francisco, or Australia. }}</ref> During the [[California Gold Rush]] in the late 1840s, Chinese merchants transported thousands of young Chinese girls, including babies, from China to the United States.

Until recently, very little was known about this apart from testimonies of retired generals and soldiers who had fought in the war. In February 2002, Korean sociologist [[Kim Kwi-ok]] wrote the first scholarly work on Korea's comfort women through official records.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 347</ref>\n\nThe South Korean \"comfort\" system was organized around three operations. First, there were \"special comfort units\" called T'uksu Wiandae (\ud2b9\uc218\uc704\uc548\ub300, \u7279\u6b8a\u6170\u5b89\u968a), which operated from seven different stations. Second, there were mobile units of comfort women that visited barracks. Third, there were prostitutes who worked in private brothels that were hired by the military. Although it is still not clear how recruitment of these comfort women were organized in the South, South Korean agents were known to have kidnapped some of the women from the North.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 215</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist [[Chunghee Sarah Soh]], the South Korean military's use of comfort women has produced \"virtually no societal response,\" despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean comfort women within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh argue that this system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these comfort women as \"military supplies\" in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of comfort women, viewing them as a \"necessary social evil\" that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.<ref>[[#Soh|Soh]], 216</ref>\n\n==Present day==\nOfficial estimates of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary.

Wrestling as a heel and managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], Boss Man's post-match routine often included handcuffing his defeated opponents to the ring ropes and beating them with a nightstick or ball and chain.\n\nAfter defeating [[Koko B. Ware]] at [[SummerSlam (1988)|the inaugural SummerSlam]], Boss Man began his first major WWF angle by attacking [[Hulk Hogan]] on [[Bruce Prichard#Brother Love Show|\"The Brother Love Show\"]]. During this feud, he also challenged [[Randy Poffo|Randy Savage]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]], and formed a team with [[One Man Gang|Akeem]] (formerly billed as One Man Gang, his UWF opponent) to form [[The Twin Towers (professional wrestling)|The Twin Towers]]. They feuded with Hogan and Savage (who had formed [[The Mega Powers]]), and were a key part in the top storyline of Savage turning on Hogan, leading to the [[WrestleMania V]] main event; in the later part of a tag match between the four on ''[[The Main Event II]]'', Hogan abandoned Savage to attend to the hurt [[Miss Elizabeth]] and went backstage. After being double-teamed for a while, Savage eventually rallied until Hogan returned to the match. After Savage tagged Hogan in, he slapped Hogan and left him to defeat The Twin Towers on his own. This led to The Mega Powers' demise as Savage beat Hulk in the backstage medical room where fellow wrestlers, managers and staff had to break them up.\n\nAt WrestleMania V, The Twin Towers defeated [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]) and then, for most of spring and early summer 1989, feuded with [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) over the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Championship]]. Meanwhile, Boss Man concluded his feud with Hogan in a series of [[Steel Cage match]]es; one of the most memorable aired on the May 27 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXI]]'', with Hogan's WWF Championship on the line. During the match, Hogan [[superplex]]ed Boss Man off the top of the cage.\n\n[[File:Big Bossman and Slick.jpg|thumb|right|Boss Man became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] after he refused to do the bidding of his villainous manager [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] (left)]]\nThe Big Boss Man turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] on the February 24, 1990 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars|Superstars]]'', when [[Ted DiBiase]] had paid Slick to have Boss Man retrieve the [[Million Dollar Championship]] belt from [[Jake Roberts]], who had stolen it. Boss Man retrieved a bag containing both the belt and Roberts' pet python, Damien. On ''[[Brother Love (wrestler)|The Brother Love Show]]'', he refused to accept DiBiase's money for the bag, and returned it to Roberts.<ref>{{Citation|last=|title=WWF History \u2013 Big Boss Man (from heel to face) YouTube video|date=March 17, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsK_EJuE_a4|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBoss Man then feuded with former partner Akeem, defeating him in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|less than two minutes]] at [[WrestleMania VI]]. As part of his face turn, he later stopped handcuffing and beating jobbers after matches. He made peace with Hogan, appearing in his corner in his match against [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] at Summerslam 1990, and teaming with him at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], along with [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] and [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]], to defeat Earthquake's team.\n\n==== Singles competition (1990&ndash;1993) ====\nIn the fall of 1990, Boss Man began feuding with [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[The Heenan Family]] after Heenan continually insulted Boss Man's mother. He won a series of matches against Heenan Family members in 1991, including [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|Royal Rumble]] and [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] (via disqualification) at [[WrestleMania VII]] in an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match, which featured the return of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]. At [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]], he defeated [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] in a Jailhouse Match, a match in which the loser must spend a night in jail. This was the only such match ever held by the promotion. Boss Man then briefly feuded with [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]].\n\nIn 1992, Boss Man began feuding with [[Kevin Wacholz|Nailz]], an ex-convict character who, in a series of promos aired before his debut, claimed Boss Man had been his abusive Officer in prison, and warned he was seeking revenge. On the May 30 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', Nailz \u2013 clad in an orange prison jumpsuit \u2013 ran into the ring and attacked Boss Man, handcuffing him to the top rope and repeatedly choking and beating him with the nightstick. Boss Man took time off TV to sell his ([[kayfabe]]) injuries, eventually returning and having a series of matches with Nailz in the latter half of 1992. The feud culminated at [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]], when Boss Man defeated Nailz in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Nightstick on a Pole match]]. This was the final push for the Boss Man during this run, as he was subsequently used as [[enhancement talent]] against [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] on the house show circuit.\n\nThe Big Boss Man's last [[pay-per-view]] match of this run came at the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], where he lost to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]. He left the WWF shortly after a [[house show]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] defeating [[Doink the Clown]] on March 14.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&wrestler=104&bild=1&details=7&liga=3&jahr=1993&seite=2 Big Boss Man's 1993 WWF matches, from].

A face, he received a title match against Rude at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade '93: 10th Anniversary]], but lost. In light of legal complaints from the WWF regarding the similarity of \"The Boss\" to \"Big Boss Man\", Traylor was renamed \"The Guardian Angel\", and wore similar attire to those in the [[Guardian Angels|organization he was named after]]. He feuded with [[Big Van Vader]] for most of 1994. In early 1995, he turned heel, and became again known as \"Big Bubba Rogers\". He defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] at [[Uncensored 1995|Uncensored]] in 1995.\n\n==== Dungeon of Doom and feud with nWo (1996&ndash;1998) ====\nIn 1996, Rogers joined [[The Dungeon of Doom]]. He feuded with former Dungeon of Doom member [[John Tenta]], and newcomer [[Glacier (wrestler)|Glacier]]. By the end of the year, he had turned on the Dungeon of Doom and joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. His stay in the nWo was brief, with Traylor knocked out by an unknown assailant at the start of the February 17, 1997 edition of Nitro, with Traylor later explaining Eric Bischoff fired him from the nWo while he was temporarily paralyzed.  Traylor returned on September 1, now using his real name and vowing to rip Bischoff's head off. He feuded with the nWo, defeating members such as [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], Curt Hennig, and [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Vincent]]. He formed an alliance with [[The Steiner Brothers]], who also sought DiBiase as their manager. The union abruptly ended when Scott Steiner turned on them to join the nWo in February 1998. After losing his final WCW Nitro match to [[Bill Goldberg]] on the March 30 episode of ''[[WCW Nitro|Nitro]]'', Traylor won his final match defeating Bret Hammer on the following ''Saturday Night'' after that he was sent home and WCW let his contract expire.\n\n===Return to WWF/E===\n====Hardcore Championship pursuit (1998&ndash;2000)====\n{{See also|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}\n[[File:1999 Big Bossman WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|220px|Big Boss Man on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in 1999]]\nTraylor rejoined the WWF shortly after his WCW release and once again became \"Big Boss Man\". On October 12, 1998, he returned to television with a new look, abandoning his blue police shirt for an all-black [[SWAT]]-style uniform, including a tactical vest and gloves. He served as [[Vince McMahon]]'s bodyguard during his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and his later feud with [[D-Generation X]]. He briefly wore a mask, before his identity was revealed.\n\nBoss Man was one of the first members of McMahon's heel stable, [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], and served as a bodyguard for other members, such as Vince's son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]]. While in The Corporation, Boss Man won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Championship]] with [[Ken Shamrock]], won the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] four times, and lost to [[The Undertaker]] at [[WrestleMania XV]] in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match. After this match, [[The Undertaker]] hanged him from the roof of the cage (an illusion made possible by a body harness concealed under Traylor's outfit).\n\nIn the WWF's Hardcore division, Boss Man's major feud was with [[Al Snow]], a feud that eventually involved Snow's pet chihuahua, Pepper. At [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], the two had a Falls Count Anywhere match that spilled into the backstage area, the street and, finally, into a nearby bar. Just prior to the match, Snow had set Pepper's [[pet carrier]] near the entranceway. Minutes into the match, Boss Man picked it up, taunted Pepper, struck Snow with the carrier and carelessly tossed it behind him. Commentator [[Jim Ross]] immediately apologized to viewers for the act, and stated that Pepper had been removed from the box before the match.\n\nTwo weeks later, Boss Man kidnapped and ransomed Pepper, arranging a meeting in which he fed Snow a meat dish supposedly made from Pepper's remains. The two settled their feud in a [[Hell in a Cell#Legacy|Kennel from Hell match]] at [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]], in which a blue solid steel cage surrounded the ring, itself and ringside surrounded by the chain-link fenced \"cell\". The object of the match was to escape from the cage and the cell while avoiding \"attack dogs\" (which turned out to be disappointingly docile) positioned outside the ring. Snow won the match and retained the Hardcore title, which had been returned to him by [[Davey Boy Smith]], who had defeated Boss Man for it.  Boss Man would later win back the Hardcore title in a triple threat match involving [[Al Snow]] and [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], and would hold it until January 2000, when he lost it to [[Test (wrestler)|Test]].\n\nBoss Man then feuded with [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] over the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]]. During the feud, Boss Man showed up at Big Show's father's funeral, made some disrespectful remarks, then chained the casket to the back of his car and drove off. The Big Show attempted to save the coffin by jumping on it, riding it for a few yards before losing his grip and tumbling off, the feud also included a segment in which Boss Man invaded the home of Big Show's mother and forced her on camera to admit her son was born an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child. Boss Man became the #1 contender for the WWF Championship by defeating [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] on the November 15, 1999 episode of ''Raw''. At [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]], The Big Show defeated him to retain the title and end the feud.\n\n==== Various feuds and departure (2000&ndash;2003) ====\nBoss Man entered the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble match]], where he eliminated [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] (with the help of five other wrestlers), [[Chyna]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]], before being eliminated by The Rock.\n\nOn the March 19 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', he introduced [[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]] as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. They teamed to defeat [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] and [[D'Lo Brown]] at [[WrestleMania 2000]], and the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]] the next month at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]]. On the June 5 ''Raw is War'', after losing to [[The Hardy Boyz]] and subsequently arguing, Boss Man knocked Buchanan out with his nightstick when his back was turned and the team split up.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Boss Man disappeared from the WWF's primary television shows, wrestling mainly on ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' and ''Heat'', where he had a minor feud with [[Crash Holly]] until suffering a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legit]] injury in January 2001. When he returned on the December 20, 2001 of ''SmackDown!'', he formed a team with [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], after Vince McMahon ordered him to be Booker's enforcer. On the December 27 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man and Booker T defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a handicap match. On the January 7, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Boss Man and Booker T were defeated by Austin and The Rock. On the January 17 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man lost to Diamond Dallas Page. At the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], Boss Man competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]. On the January 24 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man lost to Rikishi. The team quietly split in late January 2002, and Boss Man returned to ''Jakked/Metal'' and ''Heat''. On the February 2 episode of ''Metal'', Boss Man defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]]. On the February 9 episode of ''Metal'', Boss Man defeated [[Perry Saturn]]. On the March 23 episode of ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|WWF Jakked]]'', Boss Man and Mr. Perfect lost to [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The APA]]. In April, he formed a short-lived tag team with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] after both were [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to the Raw [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. On the April 1 episode of ''Raw'', Boss Man and Mr. Perfect lost to [[The Hardy Boyz]]. On the April 14 episode of ''Heat'', Boss Man lost to Bradshaw. On the April 28 episode of ''Heat'', Boss Man defeated [[Crash Holly]]. On the May 12 episode of ''Heat'', Boss Man lost to [[D'Lo Brown]]. On the May 26 episode of ''Heat'', he lost his final WWE match to [[Tommy Dreamer]].\n\nTraylor was assigned to train developmental wrestlers in [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], before being released from WWE in 2003.\n\n===International Wrestling Association of Japan (2004)===\nTraylor's final matches were in the [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]], where he competed in a tournament for the vacant [[IWA World Heavyweight Championship (IWA Japan)|IWA World Heavyweight Championship]].

He debuted on March 26, 1988, teaming with [[Bruiser Brody]] against [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] and [[John Tenta]] which went to a double countout. Throughout the tour, Traylor would mostly team with Brody as well as [[Jimmy Snuka]] while taking on stars like Tsuruta, [[Genichiro Tenryu]], [[Yoshiaki Yatsu]], [[Giant Baba]], and [[Ashura Hara]] as well as future stars like [[Mitsuharu Misawa|Tiger Mask]] and [[Akira Taue]].

Wrestling as a heel and managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], Boss Man's post-match routine often included handcuffing his defeated opponents to the ring ropes and beating them with a nightstick or ball and chain.\n\nAfter defeating [[Koko B. Ware]] at [[SummerSlam (1988)|the inaugural SummerSlam]], Boss Man began his first major WWF angle by attacking [[Hulk Hogan]] on [[Bruce Prichard#Brother Love Show|\"The Brother Love Show\"]]. During this feud, he also challenged [[Randy Poffo|Randy Savage]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]], and formed a team with [[One Man Gang|Akeem]] (formerly billed as One Man Gang, his UWF opponent) to form [[The Twin Towers (professional wrestling)|The Twin Towers]]. They feuded with Hogan and Savage (who had formed [[The Mega Powers]]), and were a key part in the top storyline of Savage turning on Hogan, leading to the [[WrestleMania V]] main event; in the later part of a tag match between the four on ''[[The Main Event II]]'', Hogan abandoned Savage to attend to the hurt [[Miss Elizabeth]] and went backstage. After being double-teamed for a while, Savage eventually rallied until Hogan returned to the match. After Savage tagged Hogan in, he slapped Hogan and left him to defeat The Twin Towers on his own. This led to The Mega Powers' demise as Savage beat Hulk in the backstage medical room where fellow wrestlers, managers and staff had to break them up.\n\nAt WrestleMania V, The Twin Towers defeated [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]])  and then, for most of spring and early summer 1989, feuded with [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) over the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Championship]]. Meanwhile, Boss Man concluded his feud with Hogan in a series of [[Steel Cage match|steel cage matches]]; one of the most memorable aired on the May 27 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXI]]'', with Hogan's WWF Championship on the line. During the match, Hogan [[superplex]]ed Boss Man off the top of the cage.\n\n[[File:Big Bossman and Slick.jpg|thumb|right|Boss Man became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] after he refused to do the bidding of his villainous manager [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] (left)]]\nThe Big Boss Man turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] on the February 24, 1990 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars|Superstars]]'', when [[Ted DiBiase]] had paid Slick to have Boss Man retrieve the [[Million Dollar Championship]] belt from [[Jake Roberts]], who had stolen it. Boss Man retrieved a bag containing both the belt and Roberts' pet python, Damien. On ''[[Brother Love (wrestler)|The Brother Love Show]]'', he refused to accept DiBiase's money for the bag, and returned it to Roberts.<ref>{{Citation|last=|title=WWF History \u2013 Big Boss Man (from heel to face) YouTube video|date=March 17, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsK_EJuE_a4|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBoss Man then feuded with former partner Akeem, defeating him in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|less than two minutes]] at [[WrestleMania VI]]. As part of his face turn, he later stopped handcuffing and beating jobbers after matches. He made peace with Hogan, appearing in his corner in his match against [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] at Summerslam 1990, and teaming with him at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], along with [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] and [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]], to defeat Earthquake's team.\n\n==== Singles competition (1990&ndash;1993) ====\nIn the fall of 1990, Boss Man began feuding with [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[The Heenan Family]] after Heenan continually insulted Boss Man's mother. He won a series of matches against Heenan Family members in 1991, including [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|Royal Rumble]] and [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] (via disqualification) at [[WrestleMania VII]] in an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match, which featured the return of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]. At [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]], he defeated [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] in a Jailhouse Match, a match in which the loser must spend a night in jail. This was the only such match ever held by the promotion. Boss Man then briefly feuded with [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]].\n\nIn 1992, Boss Man began feuding with [[Kevin Wacholz|Nailz]], an ex-convict character who, in a series of promos aired before his debut, claimed Boss Man had been his abusive Officer in prison, and warned he was seeking revenge. On the May 30 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', Nailz \u2014 clad in an orange prison jumpsuit \u2014 ran into the ring and attacked Boss Man, handcuffing him to the top rope and repeatedly choking and beating him with the nightstick. Boss Man took time off TV to sell his ([[kayfabe]]) injuries, eventually returning and having a series of matches with Nailz in the latter half of 1992. The feud culminated at [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]], when Boss Man defeated Nailz in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Nightstick on a Pole match]]. This was the final push for the Boss Man during this run, as he was subsequently used as [[enhancement talent]] against [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] on the house show circuit.\n\nThe Big Boss Man's last [[pay-per-view]] match of this run came at the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], where he lost to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]. He left the WWF shortly after a [[house show]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] defeating [[Doink the Clown]] on March 14.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&wrestler=104&bild=1&details=7&liga=3&jahr=1993&seite=2 Big Boss Man's 1993 WWF matches, from].

Due to not owning the Big Boss Man gimmick, he again used his \"Big Bubba\" name but still wore the Big Boss Man attire and carried the nightstick. He returned on July 2 defeating Mighty Inoue in a little over three minutes.<ref>[http://www.purolove.com/ajpw/results/93summeraction.php All Japan Pro Wrestling - \"Summer Action Series 1993\"] purolove.com retrieved on May 4, 2019</ref> As was the case with his previous run, he mainly worked tag matches, often with [[Stan Hansen]], [[Kendall Windham]] or \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, but also defeated Mighty Inoue, [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] and [[Tamon Honda]] in singles matches.

A face, he received a title match against Rude at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade '93: 10th Anniversary]], but lost. In light of legal complaints from the WWF regarding the similarity of \"The Boss\" to \"Big Boss Man\", Traylor was renamed \"The Guardian Angel\", and wore similar attire to those in the [[Guardian Angels|organization he was named after]]. He feuded with [[Big Van Vader]] for most of 1994. In early 1995, he turned heel, and became again known as \"Big Bubba Rogers\". He defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] at [[Uncensored 1995|Uncensored]] in 1995.\n\n==== Dungeon of Doom and feud with nWo (1996&ndash;1998) ====\nIn 1996, Rogers joined [[The Dungeon of Doom]]. He feuded with former Dungeon of Doom member [[John Tenta]], and newcomer [[Glacier (wrestler)|Glacier]]. By the end of the year, he had turned on the Dungeon of Doom and joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. His stay in the nWo was brief, with Traylor knocked out by an unknown assailant at the start of the February 17, 1997 edition of Nitro, with Traylor later explaining Eric Bischoff fired him from the nWo while he was temporarily paralyzed.  Traylor returned on September 1, now using his real name and vowing to rip Bischoff's head off. He feuded with the nWo, defeating members such as [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], Curt Hennig, and [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Vincent]]. He formed an alliance with [[The Steiner Brothers]], who also sought DiBiase as their manager. The union abruptly ended when Scott Steiner turned on them to join the nWo in February 1998. After losing his final WCW Nitro match to [[Bill Goldberg]] on the March 30 episode of ''[[WCW Nitro|Nitro]]'', Traylor won his final match defeating Bret Hammer on the following ''Saturday Night'' after that he was sent home and WCW let his contract expire.\n\n===Return to WWF/E===\n====Hardcore Championship pursuit (1998&ndash;2000)====\n{{See also|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}\n[[File:1999 Big Bossman WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|220px|Big Boss Man on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in 1999]]\nTraylor rejoined the WWF shortly after his WCW release and once again became \"Big Boss Man\". On October 12, 1998, he returned to television with a new look, abandoning his blue police shirt for an all-black [[SWAT]]-style uniform, including a tactical vest and gloves. He served as [[Vince McMahon]]'s bodyguard during his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and his later feud with [[D-Generation X]]. He briefly wore a mask, before his identity was revealed.\n\nBoss Man was one of the first members of McMahon's heel stable, [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], and served as a bodyguard for other members, such as Vince's son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]]. While in The Corporation, Boss Man won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Championship]] with [[Ken Shamrock]], won the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] four times, and lost to [[The Undertaker]] at [[WrestleMania XV]] in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match. After this match, [[The Undertaker]] hanged him from the roof of the cage (an illusion made possible by a body harness concealed under Traylor's outfit).\n\nIn the WWF's Hardcore division, Boss Man's major feud was with [[Al Snow]], a feud that eventually involved Snow's pet chihuahua, Pepper. At [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], the two had a Falls Count Anywhere match that spilled into the backstage area, the street and, finally, into a nearby bar. Just prior to the match, Snow had set Pepper's [[pet carrier]] near the entranceway. Minutes into the match, Boss Man picked it up, taunted Pepper, struck Snow with the carrier and carelessly tossed it behind him. Commentator [[Jim Ross]] immediately apologized to viewers for the act, and stated that Pepper had been removed from the box before the match.\n\nTwo weeks later, Boss Man kidnapped and ransomed Pepper, arranging a meeting in which he fed Snow a meat dish supposedly made from Pepper's remains. The two settled their feud in a [[Hell in a Cell#Legacy|Kennel from Hell match]] at [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]], in which a blue solid steel cage surrounded the ring, itself and ringside surrounded by the chain-link fenced \"cell\". The object of the match was to escape from the cage and the cell while avoiding \"attack dogs\" (which turned out to be disappointingly docile) positioned outside the ring. Snow won the match and retained the Hardcore title, which had been returned to him by [[Davey Boy Smith]], who had defeated Boss Man for it.  Boss Man would later win back the Hardcore title in a triple threat match involving [[Al Snow]] and [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], and would hold it until January 2000, when he lost it to [[Test (wrestler)|Test]].\n\nBoss Man then feuded with [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] over the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]]. During the feud, Boss Man showed up at Big Show's father's funeral, made some disrespectful remarks, then chained the casket to the back of his car and drove off. The Big Show attempted to save the coffin by jumping on it, riding it for a few yards before losing his grip and tumbling off, the feud also included a segment in which Boss Man invaded the home of Big Show's mother and forced her on camera to admit her son was born an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child. Boss Man became the #1 contender for the WWF Championship by defeating [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] on the November 15, 1999 episode of ''Raw''. At [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]], The Big Show defeated him to retain the title and end the feud.\n\n==== Various feuds and departure (2000&ndash;2003) ====\nBoss Man entered the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble match]], where he eliminated [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] (with the help of five other wrestlers), [[Chyna]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]], before being eliminated by The Rock.\n\nOn the March 19 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', he introduced [[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]] as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. They teamed to defeat [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] and [[D'Lo Brown]] at [[WrestleMania 2000]], and the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]] the next month at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]]. On the June 5 ''Raw is War'', after losing to [[The Hardy Boyz]] and subsequently arguing, Boss Man knocked Buchanan out with his nightstick when his back was turned and the team split up.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Boss Man disappeared from the WWF's primary television shows, wrestling mainly on ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' and ''Heat'', where he had a minor feud with [[Crash Holly]] until suffering a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legit]] injury in January 2001. When he returned on the December 20, 2001 of ''SmackDown!'', he formed a team with [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], after Vince McMahon ordered him to be Booker's enforcer. On the December 27 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man and Booker T defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a handicap match. On the January 7, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Boss Man and Booker T were defeated by Austin and The Rock. On the January 17 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man lost to Diamond Dallas Page. At the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], Boss Man competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]. On the January 24 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Boss Man lost to Rikishi. The team quietly split in late January 2002, and Boss Man returned to ''Jakked/Metal'' and ''Heat''. On the February 2 episode of ''Metal'', Boss Man defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]]. On the February 9 episode of ''Metal'', Boss Man defeated [[Perry Saturn]]. On the March 23 episode of ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|WWF Jakked]]'', Boss Man and Mr. Perfect lost to [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The APA]]. In April, he formed a short-lived tag team with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] after both were [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to the Raw [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]].

The song reached number one in Canada, Germany, Poland and Switzerland, number two in Austria, and became Enya's only top-ten single as a solo artist in the United States, peaking at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n==Release==\nIn 2001, \"Only Time\" was released again as a [[remix]]. The track was remixed by the Swiss American Federation (S.A.F.) (Christian B. and Marc Dold) with a final remix by Enya's producer, [[Nicky Ryan]]. Enya donated the earnings from the sale of that single to the Uniform Firefighters Association's Widows' and Children's Fund to help the families of fire fighters in the aftermath of [[9/11]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/music/day-without-rain/only-time/|title=Only Time|publisher=}}</ref> The song was also featured in the soundtrack of the motion picture ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]''. Following the September 2001 attacks, sales of the album and its lead single, \"Only Time\", skyrocketed after it was used by several radio and television networks in their coverage and aftermath of the attacks. As a result, \"Only Time\" climbed to number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart and number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary chart]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary|title=Adult Contemporary Music Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2001, [[NBC]] used the song in commercials to promote ''[[Friends]]'', which ended its season on a cliffhanger. NBC also used it as background during the death scene for character Bobby Caffey in the episode \"Unfinished Business\" (aired March 12, 2001) during the second season of ''[[Third Watch]]''. The exposure helped the song gain familiarity and increased radio play. As a result, the song became Enya's first top 40 radio hit in 12 years. The song appeared twice on the TV show ''[[Viva La Bam]]'' where it first appeared in the montage of [[Bam Margera]] destroying [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito's]] cars in \"Bamiature Golf\" and again in \"Where's Vito?\" during a retrospective for Bam's Hummer after it was thrown off the cliff by Vito. Enya performed the song at the [[2001 World Music Awards]].\n\nThe song's music video, which shows Enya performing the song in a spring, summer, fall and winter theme, was directed by [[Graham Fink]] and was released in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enyaone.com/video-only-time.html|title=Only Time, 2000.

The song reached number one in Canada, Germany, Poland and Switzerland, number two in Austria, and became Enya's only top-ten single as a solo artist in the United States, peaking at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \n\n==Release==\nIn 2001, \"Only Time\" was released again as a [[remix]]. The track was remixed by the Swiss American Federation (S.A.F.) (Christian B. and Marc Dold) with a final remix by Enya's producer, [[Nicky Ryan]]. Enya donated the earnings from the sale of that single to the Uniform Firefighters Association's Widows' and Children's Fund to help the families of fire fighters in the aftermath of [[9/11]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/music/day-without-rain/only-time/|title=Only Time|publisher=}}</ref> The song was also featured in the soundtrack of the motion picture ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]''. Following the September 2001 attacks, sales of the album and its lead single, \"Only Time\", skyrocketed after it was used by several radio and television networks in their coverage and aftermath of the attacks. As a result, \"Only Time\" climbed to number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart and number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary chart]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary|title=Adult Contemporary Music Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2001, [[NBC]] used the song in commercials to promote ''[[Friends]]'', which ended its season on a cliffhanger. NBC also used it as background during the death scene for character Bobby Caffey in the episode \"Unfinished Business\" (aired March 12, 2001) during the second season of ''[[Third Watch]]''. The exposure helped the song gain familiarity and increased radio play. As a result, the song became Enya's first top 40 radio hit in 12 years. The song appeared twice on the TV show ''[[Viva La Bam]]'' where it first appeared in the montage of [[Bam Margera]] destroying [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito's]] cars in \"Bamiature Golf\" and again in \"Where's Vito?\" during a retrospective for Bam's Hummer after it was thrown off the cliff by Vito. Enya performed the song at the [[2001 World Music Awards]].\n\nThe song's music video, which shows Enya performing the song in a spring, summer, fall and winter theme, was directed by [[Graham Fink]] and was released in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enyaone.com/video-only-time.html|title=Only Time, 2000.

{"title_page": "Fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag", "text_new": "{{short description|Protein tag}}\n'''FAST''' (''Fluorescence-Activating and absorption-Shifting Tag'') is a small, genetically-encoded, [[protein tag]] which allows for fluorescence reporting of proteins of interest.  Unlike natural fluorescent proteins and derivates such as GFP or mCherry, FAST is not fluorescent by itself.  It can bind selectively a fluorogenic chromophore derived from 4-hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (HBR), which is itself non fluorescent unless bound.  Once bound, the pair of molecules goes through a unique fluorogen activation mechanism based on two spectroscopic changes, increase of fluorescence quantum yield and absorption red shift, hence providing high labeling selectivity.  The FAST-fluorogen reporting system can be used in fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and any other fluorometric method to explore the living world: biosensors, protein trafficking.\n\nFAST, a small 14 kDa protein, was engineered from the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) by directed evolution.  It was reported for the first time in 2016 by researchers from [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris)|Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Paris]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plamont|first=Marie-Aude|last2=Billon-Denis|first2=Emmanuelle|last3=Maurin|first3=Sylvie|last4=Gauron|first4=Carole|last5=Pimenta|first5=Frederico M.|last6=Specht|first6=Christian G.|last7=Shi|first7=Jian|last8=Qu\u00e9rard|first8=J\u00e9r\u00f4me|last9=Pan|first9=Buyan|last10=Rossignol|first10=Julien|last11=Moncoq|first11=Karine|date=2015-12-28|title=Small fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag for tunable protein imaging in vivo|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=3|pages=497\u2013502|doi=10.1073/pnas.1513094113|pmid=26711992|pmc=4725535|issn=0027-8424}}</ref>\n__TOC__\n== Mechanism ==\nFAST pertains to a chemical-genetic strategy for specific labeling of proteins.

Unlike natural fluorescent proteins and derivates such as GFP or mCherry, FAST is not fluorescent by itself.  It can bind selectively a fluorogenic chromophore derived from 4-hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (HBR), which is itself non fluorescent unless bound.  Once bound, the pair of molecules goes through a unique fluorogen activation mechanism based on two spectroscopic changes, increase of fluorescence quantum yield and absorption red shift, hence providing high labeling selectivity.  The FAST-fluorogen reporting system can be used in fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and any other fluorometric method to explore the living world: biosensors, protein trafficking, high-content analysis.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nFAST, a small 14 kDa protein, was engineered from the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) by directed evolution.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an [[Ecommerce platform|E-Commerce platform]] for Chinese enterprises, especially [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global market as well as address [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) challenges.

Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market, as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay.
