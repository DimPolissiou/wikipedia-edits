From February 2020, several shows were cancelled due to concerns over [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://nct-jp.net/en/live/tour.php?id=1001655</ref><ref>https://www.bworldonline.com/living-the-nct-dream/</ref>\n\nOn April 14, SM entertainment announced that NCT Dream will release their fourth EP, ''Reload'' with the current six members Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle and Jisung on April 29. After the album's promotion period, the graduation system will be abolished and NCT Dream will continue its activity with all seven members, including original member Mark who previously graduated at the end of 2018. NCT Dream will function as a more fixed group with diverse concepts in each promotion - similar to NCT U - and the seven original members would continue their activities under the name NCT Dream as well as have possibility to take part in other activities including other NCT units in the future.<ref name=reload/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9357513/nct-dream-new-album-reload-return-of-mark|title=NCT Dream Set New Album 'Reload,' Scrap Age-Based System With Return of Mark|last=Tamar|first=Herman|date=April 14, 2020|website=Billboard|publisher=|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>https://www.teenvogue.com/story/nct-dream-officially-coming-back-new-album-reload</ref>\n\n==Members==\n* [[Mark Lee (singer)|Mark]] (\ub9c8\ud06c)\n* Renjun (\ub7f0\uc954)\n* Jeno (\uc81c\ub178)\n* Haechan (\ud574\ucc2c)\n* [[Na Jae-min|Jaemin]] (\uc7ac\ubbfc)\n* [[Zhong Chenle|Chenle]] (\ucc9c\ub7ec)\n* Jisung (\uc9c0\uc131)\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|NCT discography}}\n{{See also|NCT videography}}\n\n===Extended plays===\n\n*''[[We Young|We Young]]'' (2017)\n*''[[We Go Up]]'' (2018)\n*''[[We Boom]]'' (2019)\n*''Reload'' (2020)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by NCT}}\n\n==Shows and concerts==\n===Headlining===\n* NCT Dream Show (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smentertainment.com/PressCenter/Details/1945|title=NCT DREAM, Music Variety Show 'NCT DREAM SHOW' held in September|date=September 7, 2018|website=SM Entertainment}}</ref>\n* NCT Dream Tour \"The Dream Show\" (2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/now/article/609/0000180110|title=SM \uce21 \"NCT DREAM, 11\uc6d4 \uccab \ub2e8\ub3c5 \ucf58\uc11c\ud2b8 \uac1c\ucd5c\"(\uacf5\uc2dd)|date=October 1, 2019|website=Naver}}</ref>\n\n===Joint tours===\n* [[SM Town Live World Tour VI]] (2017\u20132018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n{{NCT (band)}}\n[[Category:NCT (band)| ]]\n[[Category:South Korean boy bands]]\n[[Category:SM Town]]\n[[Category:SM Entertainment artists]]\n[[Category:2016 establishments in South Korea]]\n[[Category:South Korean dance music groups]]\n[[Category:South Korean pop music groups]]\n[[Category:South Korean male dancers]]\n[[Category:South Korean hip hop groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2016]]\n", "name_user": "PeaceNT", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCT_Dream"}
