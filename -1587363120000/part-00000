The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>\n\nA week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner, [[Mick Miller (police officer) |Mick Miller]], stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Ro.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria |Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, when he was 12, he was convicted for fishing in prohibited area. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery at [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division. While in prison, Taylor met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nWith Zelinka's statement and corroborating evidence, detectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.

In February 1905, he was seriously wounded in the head. \n\nHe spent about five years abroad, primarily in [[France]], where he attended the [[Paris]] Military Academy. In 1907, Muravyov fell under the influence of revolutionary ideas and joined Boris Savinkov's Socialist Revolutionary group.<ref name=\"Savchenko\">{{cite book|last=Savchenko|first=Victor A.|title=Adventurers of the Civil War: A Historical Investigation)|publisher=ACT|date=2000|page=368}}</ref>.\n\nOn January 1, 1909 he served in the 1st Nevsky Infantry Regiment in the [[Caucasus]]. For seven years he served as a teacher at the Kazan Military School, married the daughter of the commander of the reserve Skopinsky infantry regiment.\n\n===World War I===\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]], after receiving a number of serious wounds at the front, he was transferred by a tactics teacher to the ensign school in Odessa <ref name=\"Komissarov/>.\n\n===February revolution===\nDuring the [[February Revolution]], Muravyov was on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] <ref name=\"Chronos\">{{cite web|title=Muravyov Mikhail Artemievich|website=Project \u201cChronos\u201d (hrono.ru)|accessdate=March 15, 2013|url=http://hrono.ru/biograf/bio_m/muravevma.php|language=ru}}</ref>. In March, he tried to oust the [[Governor of Odessa Oblast|Governor of Odessa]] [[:ru:\u042d\u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0418\u0441\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Ebelov]] for being \"insufficiently revolutionary and a [[Constitutional Democratic Party|cadet]].\"<ref name=\"Komissarov/>\n\nIn May, at the 1st Congress of the Southwestern Front ([[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]), he took the initiative to create volunteer strike units. In [[Petrograd]], he headed the \"Organizing Bureau of the All-Russian Central Committee for the Recruitment of Volunteers into Shock Units\" <ref name=\"Chronos\"/> (he was also the chairman of the \"Central Executive Committee for the formation of the revolutionary army from volunteer rear services to continue the war with Germany\" <ref name=\"SovEn\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Muravyov Mikhail Artemievich|publisher=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] |editor=[[Alexander Prokhorov]]|date=1969-1978}}</ref>), and led the formation of volunteer [[shock troops|shock battalions]]. In this field, Muravyov managed to form up to one hundred \"death battalions\" and several women's battalions. He was spotted by [[Alexander Kerensky]], who appointed him chief of security of the Provisional Government, and promoted him to lieutenant colonel <ref name=\"Komissarov/>.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Kornilov affair|Kornilov coup]], he severed further relations with the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and joined the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who actively criticized Kerensky.<ref name=\"Kiev>{{cite article|title=Who is Muravyov|publisher=Kiev thought|date=November 5, 1917}}</ref>\n\n===October Revolution===\nAfter the [[October Revolution]], he offered his services to the Soviet government. Two days after the uprising in Petrograd, Muravyov met with [[Yakov Sverdlov]] and [[Vladimir Ulyanov]], after which he was authorized to organize a fight against marauders who plundered the Petrograd wine shops <ref name=\"Komissarov/>.\n\nOn October 27, he became a member of the [[Revolutionary Military Committee]] and was elected the chief of defense of Petrograd. He was then appointed commander-in-chief of the troops of the Petrograd Military District, and then appointed commander of the troops operating against the forces of [[Kerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising|Kerensky-Krasnov]] <ref name=\"SovEn\"/>. But on November 8 announced his resignation from these positions, in connection with the withdrawal of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries from government posts <ref name=\"Komissarov/>.\n\n=== In Ukraine and on the Romanian front===\n{{main|Ukrainian Revolution}}\nOn December 6, 1917, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] formed the [[Southern Front (RSFSR)|Southern Front]] to combat [[counter-revolution]] and [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] was appointed to be its commander in chief <ref>{{cite book|title=Red Banner Kiev. Essays on the history of the Red Banner Kiev Military District (1919-1979).|location=Kiev|date=1979}}</ref>. Muravyov was appointed Antonov-Ovseenko's chief of staff <ref name=\"Komissarov/>. Together with the commander of the troops of the Moscow military district, [[Nikolay Muralov]], he formed [[Moscow]] [[Red Guard]] detachments to send against the troops of [[Alexey Kaledin]] <ref name=\"Chronos\"/>. One of the inventors of the \"echelon war\" tactics <ref name=\"Komissarov/><ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. After the Southern Front entered [[Kharkov]], where the [[Congress of Soviets]] proclaimed Soviet power in [[Ukraine]], Antonov-Ovseenko transferred the command of the troops operating in Ukraine to Muravyov, and he himself led the fight against the [[Don Cossack]] troops.\n\nOn January 4, 1918, the [[Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets|Soviet government of Ukraine]] officially declared war on the [[Central Council of Ukraine]]. General management of the operation was assigned to Muravyov. On January 6, Muravyov\u2019s troops entered [[Poltava]]. During the occupation of Poltava, Muravyov ordered the execution of 98 cadets and officers <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>.\n\nFour days after the troops of the Central Council suppressed the [[Kiev Arsenal January Uprising|January uprising]] in [[Kiev]], Muravyov\u2019s troops entered the city, where the [[Red Terror|terror]] regime was established. During the storming of the city, a massive shelling was carried out, as a result of which the Grushevsky apartment building was destroyed. Before the assault itself, on February 4, Muravyov ordered his troops: \u201cto mercilessly destroy all [[officers]], [[Cadet Party|cadets]], [[Haidamakas]], [[Monarchism#Russian|monarchists]] and enemies of the revolution in Kiev\u201d <ref>{{cite book|last=Antonov-Ovseenko|first=Vladimir|title=Notes on the Civil War|date=1924|page=154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://xxl3.ru/krasnie/tinchenko/tinchenko.htm|last=Tinchenko|first=Y.

According to the [[Ukrainian Red Cross]], in the first days after the establishment of Muravyov\u2019s power in Kiev, up to 5 thousand people were killed, of which up to 3 thousand were officers.

The disarmed city is gradually returning to normal, as it was before the bombing... I ordered the units of the 7th Army to cut the route of retreat - the remnants of the Central Council are making their way to [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. I met representatives of the powers of [[England]], [[France]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Serbia]], who all declared to me, as a representative of the Soviet government, their complete loyalty ... I ordered artillery to strike at high-rise and rich palaces, at churches and priests ... I burned down Grushevsky\u2019s big house, and he for three days it burned with a bright flame ...\"}}\n\n[[Victor A. Savchenko]] accompanied this statement by Muravyov with the following remark: \n\n{{quote|\u201cMuravyov clearly bragged about his international activities, all the more so since the Czech Republic simply did not exist in February 1918, and Serbia was completely occupied by Austrian troops.\u201d<ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>}}\n\nMuravyov was a staunch opponent of \u201c[[Ukrainization]],\u201d and his troops carried out mass repressions against the Ukrainian intelligentsia, officers, and the bourgeoisie, it even became dangerous to speak Ukrainian in the streets. The People\u2019s Secretariat of Ukraine, which had moved to Kiev from Kharkov, demanded the removal of Muravyov from the city, calling him \u201cthe leader of the bandits\u201d <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>.\n\nOn February 14, Muravyov was appointed commander of the front, having received the task of opposing the Romanian forces, who sought to seize [[Bessarabia]] and [[Transnistria]] <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. In his telegram, Lenin demanded from Muravyov: \u201cAct as energetically as possible on the Romanian front\u201d <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. In response, Muravyov reported <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>:\n{{quote|\u201cThe situation is extremely serious. The troops of the former front are disorganized, in reality there is no front, only headquarters remain, the location of which have not been clarified. The hope is only for reinforcements from outside. The Odessa proletariat is disorganized and politically illiterate. Ignoring the fact that the enemy is approaching Odessa, they do not think to worry. The attitude to the matter is very cold - specifically in Odessa.\"}}\n\nOn March 9, he established military revolutionary tribunals in the controlled territory. <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/> Muravyov commanded the troops of the [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] until March 12, but could not hold the city. After leaving Odessa on March 11-12, he ordered the ground units and ships of the navy of the Odessa Soviet Republic \"to open fire with all guns at the bourgeois and nationalist parts of the city and destroy it.\" <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>\n\nOn April 1, having abandoned his troops, Muravyov arrived in Moscow. Ulyanov, on the initiative of Antonov-Ovseenko, offered him the post of commander of the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|Caucasian Soviet Army]], but the local Bolsheviks, headed by the chairman of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Council of People's Commissars]] [[Stepan Shaumian]], very sharply opposed such a candidate <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>.\n\nIn mid-April, in parallel with the [[Black Guards#Militarization in Ukraine and suppression in Russia|suppression of the anarchists]] in Moscow, Muravyov was arrested on charges of abuse of power and connections with the anarchists <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>; the commission of inquiry did not confirm the charge, and by a decree of the Presidium of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], the case \u201cfor the lack of corpus delicti\u201d was dismissed <ref name=\"Chronos\"/>. Muravyov himself, being in Odessa, described his \u201cexploits\u201d in Kiev as follows <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>:\n{{quote|\u201cWe were establishing Soviet power by fire and sword. I took the city, destroyed the palaces and churches ... giving no mercy to anyone! ... Hundreds of generals, maybe thousands, were ruthlessly killed ... We took revenge. We could stop the anger of revenge, but we did not do it because our aim was to be merciless!}}\n\n===Rebellion and Death===\nOn June 13, Muravyov was appointed commander of the [[Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War|Eastern Front]] <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. The German ambassador [[Wilhelm von Mirbach]], wanting to motivate Muravyov to join the Bolsheviks in the fight against the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], handed him a bribe <ref name=\"Kiev/>. However, this did not prevent him from rebelling against the Bolsheviks.<ref name=\"Kiev/>.\n\nDuring the [[Left SR uprising]], Ulyanov began to doubt Muravyov\u2019s loyalty, ordering the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the eastern front to secretly monitor his actions: \u201cReport Muravyov\u2019s statement about the rebellion of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Continue close monitoring \u201d<ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. Muravyov rebelled, having received news from Moscow and fearing arrest due to Bolshevik suspicions of disloyalty <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. Muravyov himself, during the events, declared that he \"acted independently, but the Left SR Central Committee knows everything.\"<ref name=\"Kiev/> On the night of July 9\u201310, Muravyov, having left the front headquarters in [[Kazan]], without the knowledge of the military council of the front, loaded two regiments loyal to him onto steamers and left the city <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. He even managed to transfer the local communist squad from [[Simbirsk]]] to [[Bugulma]] by order of the front <ref name=\"Bonch\">{{cite book|last=Bonch-Bruevich|first=Mikhail Dmitriyevich|title=All power to the Soviets!|location=Moscow|publisher=Military Publishing House|date=1958}}</ref>.\n\nHe opposed the conclusion of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] with [[German Empire|Germany]], declared himself \"commander in chief of the army operating against Germany\", and sent a telegraph to the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the [[RSFSR]], the German embassy in Moscow and the command of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], declaring war on Germany. The troops of the front and the Czechoslovak Legion (with which he had to fight before the rebellion) were ordered to move to the [[Volga]] and further west to repulse the German invasion <ref name=\"Komissarov/> <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. He took the initiative to create the so-called ''Volga Soviet Republic'' led by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries [[Maria Spiridonova]], [[Boris Kamkov]] and [[Vladimir Karelin]] <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. \n\nIn a joint government appeal, Ulyanov and Trotsky stated that \u201cThe former commander-in-chief on the Czech-Slovak front, the left Socialist Revolutionary Muravyov, is declared a traitor and an enemy of the people. Every honest citizen is obliged to shoot him on the spot\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|title=About the betrayal of Muravyov|publisher=\u201cIzvestia of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee\u201d|date=July 12, 1918|location=Moscow}}</ref>. \n\nOn July 11, Muravyov, with a detachment of a thousand people <ref name=\"Kiev/>, arrived at [[Simbirsk]], occupied strategic points of the city and arrested leading Soviet workers (including the commander of the 1st Army [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] <ref name=\"Kiev/>). Muravyov appeared at a meeting of the executive committee of the provincial Council, together with representatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries<ref name=\"Kiev/>. At that time, the local Left SRs were not yet removed from power and held the posts of military, land and food provincial commissars <ref name=\"Bonch\"/>. By this time, the chairman of the local Bolshevik party committee had managed to secretly place [[Latvian riflemen]], an armored squad and a special detachment of the [[Cheka]] around the building <ref name=\"Savchenko\"/>. During the meeting, the [[Red Guards]] and the [[Cheka]] came out from the ambush and announced the arrest of everyone in the building.

[[Conjunction (astronomy)|Conjunctions]] are highlighted by brief color changes. There are two Io-Europa conjunctions (green) and three Io-Ganymede conjunctions (grey) for each Europa-Ganymede conjunction (magenta).]]\n\nIn [[celestial mechanics]], '''orbital resonance''' occurs when [[orbit]]ing bodies exert regular, periodic [[gravitational]] influence on each other, usually because their [[orbital period]]s are related by a ratio of small [[integer]]s. Most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects. The physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a [[swing (seat)|swing]], where the orbit and the swing both have a [[natural frequency]], and the other body doing the \"pushing\" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange [[momentum]] and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance between bodies with similar orbital radii causes large [[Solar System]] bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of [[clearing the neighbourhood]], an effect that is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].\n\nA binary resonance ratio in this article should be interpreted as the ''ratio of number of orbits'' completed in the same time interval, rather than as the ''ratio of orbital periods'', which would be the inverse ratio. Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships among three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.\n\n==History==\nSince the discovery of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in the 17th century, the [[stability of the Solar System]] has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. The stable orbits that arise in a [[N-body problem|two-body approximation]] ignore the influence of other bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the [[Solar System]] is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.\n\nIt was Laplace who found the first answers explaining the linked orbits of the [[Galilean moon]]s (see below). Before Newton, there was also consideration of ratios and proportions in orbital motions, in what was called \"the music of the spheres\", or [[Musica universalis]].\n\n==Types of resonance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pandora (moon)]] -->\n\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt 75AU All.svg|thumb|300px|The [[semimajor axis|semimajor axes]] of [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s (red) are clumped at locations of low-integer resonances with [[Neptune]] (vertical red bars near top), in contrast to those of [[cubewano]]s (blue) and nonresonant (or not known to be resonant) [[scattered disk|scattered objects]] (grey).]]\n[[Image:Kirkwood Gaps.svg|300px|thumb|A chart of the distribution of [[asteroid]] semimajor axes, showing the [[Kirkwood gap]]s where orbits are destabilized by resonances with [[Jupiter]]]]\n[[Image:PIA10452 - Saturn A ring spiral density waves.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Spiral density wave]]s in [[Rings of Saturn#A Ring|Saturn's A Ring]] excited by resonances with [[Moons of Saturn#Ring shepherds|inner moons]].

Depending on the details, this can either stabilize or destabilize the orbit.\n''Stabilization'' may occur when the two bodies move in such a synchronised fashion that they never closely approach. For instance:\n*The orbits of [[Pluto]] and the [[plutino]]s are stable, despite crossing that of the much larger [[Neptune]], because they are in a 2:3 resonance with it. The resonance ensures that, when they approach perihelion and Neptune's orbit, Neptune is consistently distant (averaging a quarter of its orbit away). Other (much more numerous) Neptune-crossing bodies that were not in resonance were ejected from that region by strong [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s due to Neptune. There are also smaller but significant groups of [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s occupying the 1:1 ([[Neptune trojan]]s), [[resonant Kuiper belt object#3:5 resonance (period ~275 years)|3:5]], [[resonant Kuiper belt object#4:7 resonance (period ~290 years)|4:7]], 1:2 ([[resonant Kuiper belt object#1:2 resonance (\"twotinos\", period ~330 years)|twotinos]]) and [[resonant Kuiper belt object#2:5 resonance (period ~410 years)|2:5]] resonances, among others, with respect to Neptune.\n*In the [[asteroid belt]] beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun, the 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 resonances with [[Jupiter]] are populated by ''clumps'' of asteroids (the [[Hilda family]], the few [[Thule asteroid]]s, and the numerous [[Jupiter trojan|Trojan asteroids]], respectively).\n\nOrbital resonances can also ''destabilize'' one of the orbits. This process can be exploited to find energy-efficient ways of [[deorbit]]ing spacecraft.<ref name=\"Witze2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Witze |first1=A. |title=The quest to conquer Earth's space junk problem |journal=Nature |volume=561 |issue=7721 |date=5 September 2018 |pages=24\u201326 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-06170-1|pmid=30185967 |bibcode=2018Natur.561...24W |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"Daquin2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Daquin |first1=J. |last2=Rosengren |first2=A.

For instance:\n*In the [[asteroid belt]] within 3.5 AU from the Sun, the major mean-motion resonances with [[Jupiter]] are locations of ''gaps'' in the asteroid distribution, the [[Kirkwood gap]]s (most notably at the 4:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 resonances). [[Asteroid]]s have been ejected from these almost empty lanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of asteroids temporarily present in or near these resonances. For example, asteroids of the [[Alinda family]] are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased by interactions with Jupiter until they eventually have a close encounter with an inner planet that ejects them from the resonance.\n*In the [[rings of Saturn]], the [[Rings of Saturn#Cassini Division|Cassini Division]] is a gap between the inner [[Rings of Saturn#B Ring|B Ring]] and the outer [[Rings of Saturn#A Ring|A Ring]] that has been cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].

The A Ring's outer edge is maintained by a destabilizing 7:6 resonance with the moon [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].\n\nMost bodies that are in resonance orbit in the same direction; however, the [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]] asteroid [[514107 Ka\u02bbepaoka\u02bbawela]] appears to be in a stable (for a period of at least a million years) 1:\u22121 resonance with Jupiter.<ref name= \"Wieger2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Wiegert |first1=P. |last2=Connors |first2=M. |last3=Veillet |first3=C. |title=A retrograde co-orbital asteroid of Jupiter |journal=Nature |volume=543 |issue=7647 |date=30 March 2017 |pages=687\u2013689 |doi=10.1038/nature22029 |pmid=28358083 |bibcode=2017Natur.543..687W}}</ref> In addition, a few retrograde [[Damocloid asteroid|damocloids]] have been found that are temporarily captured in mean-motion resonance with [[Jupiter]] or [[Saturn]].<ref name=\"Morais_2013\">{{cite journal |last=Morais |first=M.

The gradual depletion of the Kuiper belt would have decreased the precession rate of Neptune's orbit; eventually, the frequencies matched, and Saturn's axial precession was captured into the spin-orbit resonance, leading to an increase in Saturn's obliquity. (The angular momentum of Neptune's orbit is 10<sup>4</sup> times that of Saturn's spin, and thus dominates the interaction.)\n\nThe [[secular resonance#?6 resonance|perihelion secular resonance]] between [[asteroid]]s and [[Saturn]] (''\u03bd<sub>6</sub>'' = ''g'' \u2212 ''g<sub>6</sub>'') helps shape the asteroid belt (the subscript \"6\" identifies Saturn as the sixth planet from the Sun). Asteroids which approach it have their eccentricity slowly increased until they become [[Mars-crossing asteroid|Mars-crossers]], at which point they are usually ejected from the [[asteroid belt]] by a close pass to [[Mars]]. This resonance forms the inner and \"side\" boundaries of the [[asteroid belt]] around 2 [[astronomical unit|AU]], and at inclinations of about 20\u00b0.\n\nNumerical simulations have suggested that the eventual formation of a perihelion secular resonance between [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and Jupiter (''g<sub>1</sub>'' = ''g<sub>5</sub>'') has the potential to greatly increase Mercury's eccentricity and possibly destabilize the inner Solar System several billion years from now.<ref name=\"Laskar2008\">\n{{cite journal |last=Laskar |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Chaotic diffusion in the Solar System |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201315 |arxiv=0802.3371 |bibcode=2008Icar..196....1L |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2008.02.017}}</ref><ref name=\"Laskar2009\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Laskar |first1=J. |last2=Gastineau |first2=M. |year=2009 |title=Existence of collisional trajectories of Mercury, Mars and Venus with the Earth |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=459 |issue=7248 |pages=817\u2013819 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..817L |doi=10.1038/nature08096 |pmid=19516336}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rings of Saturn#Colombo Gap and Titan Ringlet|Titan Ringlet]] within Saturn's [[Rings of Saturn#C Ring|C Ring]] represents another type of resonance in which the rate of [[apsidal precession]] of one orbit exactly matches the speed of revolution of another.

The moons Styx, Nix and Hydra are also involved in a true [[Orbital resonance#Laplace resonance|3-body resonance]].]]\n\nA number of near-[[integer]]-ratio relationships between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, these have no dynamical significance because there is no appropriate precession of [[perihelion]] or other libration to make the resonance perfect (see the detailed discussion in the [[Orbital resonance#Mean-motion resonances in the Solar System|section above]]). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because (unlike a true resonance), after each cycle the relative position of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. The mismatch after 8 years is only 1.5\u00b0 of Venus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their relative position is effectively random.\n\nThe presence of a near resonance may reflect that a perfect resonance existed in the past, or that the system is evolving towards one in the future.\n\nSome orbital frequency coincidences include:\n\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In all three satellite systems, moons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances in the past as their orbits shifted due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] (a process by which satellites gain orbital energy at the expense of the primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). In the Uranian system, however, due to the planet's lesser degree of [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]]ness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the primary alters its gravitational field in such a way that different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relative satellite size increases the strength of their interactions. Both factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases in [[orbital eccentricity]] or [[inclination]].\n\nMean-motion resonances that probably once existed in the Uranus System include (3:5) Ariel-Miranda, (1:3) Umbriel-Miranda, (3:5) Umbriel-Ariel, and (1:4) Titania-Ariel.<ref name=\"Tittemore1988\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Tittemore |first1=W.

The near resonances may be maintained by a 15% local fluctuation in the Pluto-Charon gravitational field. Thus, these near resonances may not be coincidental.\n\nThe smaller inner moon of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], [[Namaka (moon)|Namaka]], is one tenth the mass of the larger outer moon, [[Hi\u02bbiaka (moon)|Hi{{okina}}iaka]].

Most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects. The physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a [[swing (seat)|swing]], where the orbit and the swing both have a [[natural frequency]], and the other body doing the \"pushing\" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange [[momentum]] and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance between bodies with similar orbital radii causes large [[Solar System]] bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of [[clearing the neighbourhood]], an effect that is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].\n\nA binary resonance ratio in this article should be interpreted as the ''ratio of number of orbits'' completed in the same time interval, rather than as the ''ratio of orbital periods'', which would be the inverse ratio. Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships among three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.\n\n==History==\nSince the discovery of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in the 17th century, the [[stability of the Solar System]] has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. The stable orbits that arise in a [[N-body problem|two-body approximation]] ignore the influence of other bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the [[Solar System]] is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.\n\nIt was Laplace who found the first answers explaining the linked orbits of the [[Galilean moon]]s (see below). Before Newton, there was also consideration of ratios and proportions in orbital motions, in what was called \"the music of the spheres\", or [[Musica universalis]].\n\n==Types of resonance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pandora (moon)]] -->\n\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt 75AU All.svg|thumb|300px|The [[semimajor axis|semimajor axes]] of [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s (red) are clumped at locations of low-integer resonances with [[Neptune]] (vertical red bars near top), in contrast to those of [[cubewano]]s (blue) and nonresonant (or not known to be resonant) [[scattered disk|scattered objects]] (grey).]]\n[[Image:Kirkwood Gaps.svg|300px|thumb|A chart of the distribution of [[asteroid]] semimajor axes, showing the [[Kirkwood gap]]s where orbits are destabilized by resonances with [[Jupiter]]]]\n[[Image:PIA10452 - Saturn A ring spiral density waves.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Spiral density wave]]s in [[Rings of Saturn#A Ring|Saturn's A Ring]] excited by resonances with [[Moons of Saturn#Ring shepherds|inner moons]].

Depending on the details, this can either stabilize or destabilize the orbit.\n''Stabilization'' may occur when the two bodies move in such a synchronised fashion that they never closely approach. For instance:\n*The orbits of [[Pluto]] and the [[plutino]]s are stable, despite crossing that of the much larger [[Neptune]], because they are in a 2:3 resonance with it. The resonance ensures that, when they approach perihelion and Neptune's orbit, Neptune is consistently distant (averaging a quarter of its orbit away). Other (much more numerous) Neptune-crossing bodies that were not in resonance were ejected from that region by strong [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s due to Neptune. There are also smaller but significant groups of [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s occupying the 1:1 ([[Neptune trojan]]s), [[resonant Kuiper belt object#3:5 resonance (period ~275 years)|3:5]], [[resonant Kuiper belt object#4:7 resonance (period ~290 years)|4:7]], 1:2 ([[resonant Kuiper belt object#1:2 resonance (\"twotinos\", period ~330 years)|twotinos]]) and [[resonant Kuiper belt object#2:5 resonance (period ~410 years)|2:5]] resonances, among others, with respect to Neptune.\n*In the [[asteroid belt]] beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun, the 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 resonances with [[Jupiter]] are populated by ''clumps'' of asteroids (the [[Hilda family]], the few [[Thule asteroid]]s, and the numerous [[Jupiter trojan|Trojan asteroids]], respectively).\n\nOrbital resonances can also ''destabilize'' one of the orbits. This process can be exploited to find energy-efficient ways of [[deorbit]]ing spacecraft.<ref name=\"Witze2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Witze |first1=A. |title=The quest to conquer Earth's space junk problem |journal=Nature |volume=561 |issue=7721 |date=5 September 2018 |pages=24\u201326 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-06170-1|pmid=30185967 |bibcode=2018Natur.561...24W |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"Daquin2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Daquin |first1=J. |last2=Rosengren |first2=A.

[[Asteroid]]s have been ejected from these almost empty lanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of asteroids temporarily present in or near these resonances. For example, asteroids of the [[Alinda family]] are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased by interactions with Jupiter until they eventually have a close encounter with an inner planet that ejects them from the resonance.\n*In the [[rings of Saturn]], the [[Rings of Saturn#Cassini Division|Cassini Division]] is a gap between the inner [[Rings of Saturn#B Ring|B Ring]] and the outer [[Rings of Saturn#A Ring|A Ring]] that has been cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].

This resonance applies only to bodies on highly inclined orbits; as a consequence, such orbits tend to be unstable, since the growing eccentricity would result in small [[Apsis|pericenters]], typically leading to a collision or (for large moons) destruction by [[tidal forces]].\n\nIn an example of another type of resonance involving orbital eccentricity, the eccentricities of Ganymede and Callisto vary with a common period of 181 years, although with opposite phases.<ref name=Musotto2002>\n{{cite journal |last=Musotto |first=S. |last2=Varad |first2=F. |last3=Moore |first3=W. |last4=Schubert |first4=G. |year=2002 |title=Numerical Simulations of the Orbits of the Galilean Satellites |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=500\u2013504 |doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6939 |bibcode=2002Icar..159..500M}}</ref>\n\n==Mean-motion resonances in the Solar System==\n\n[[File:Haumea.GIF|thumb|300px|right|Depiction of [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]]'s presumed 7:12 resonance with [[Neptune]] in a [[rotating frame]], with Neptune (blue dot at lower right) held stationary.

As it orbits Neptune, the more inclined Naiad successively passes Thalassa twice from above and then twice from below, in a cycle that repeats every ~21.5 Earth days. The two moons are about 3540 km apart when they pass each other. Although their orbital radii differ by only 1850 km, Naiad swings ~2800 km above or below Thalassa's orbital plane at closest approach. As is common, this resonance stabilizes the orbits by maximizing separation at conjunction, but it is unusual for the role played by orbital inclination in maintaining this avoidance in a case where eccentricities are minimal.<ref name=\"Brozovic2019\">{{cite journal|last = Brozovi\u0107|first = M.|last2 = Showalter|first2 = M.

The moons Styx, Nix and Hydra are also involved in a true [[Orbital resonance#Laplace resonance|3-body resonance]].]]\n\nA number of near-[[integer]]-ratio relationships between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, these have no dynamical significance because there is no appropriate precession of [[perihelion]] or other libration to make the resonance perfect (see the detailed discussion in the [[Orbital resonance#Mean-motion resonances in the Solar System|section above]]). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because (unlike a true resonance), after each cycle the relative position of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. The mismatch after 8 years is only 1.5\u00b0 of Venus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their relative position is effectively random.\n\nThe presence of a near resonance may reflect that a perfect resonance existed in the past, or that the system is evolving towards one in the future.\n\nSome orbital frequency coincidences include:\n\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In all three satellite systems, moons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances in the past as their orbits shifted due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] (a process by which satellites gain orbital energy at the expense of the primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). In the Uranian system, however, due to the planet's lesser degree of [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]]ness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the primary alters its gravitational field in such a way that different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relative satellite size increases the strength of their interactions. Both factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases in [[orbital eccentricity]] or [[inclination]].\n\nMean-motion resonances that probably once existed in the Uranus System include (3:5) Ariel-Miranda, (1:3) Umbriel-Miranda, (3:5) Umbriel-Ariel, and (1:4) Titania-Ariel.<ref name=\"Tittemore1988\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Tittemore |first1=W.

Passage through the resonance is thought to have excited both moons' eccentricities to a degree that has not since been entirely damped out.<ref name=\"ZhangHamilton2007\"/><ref name=\"ZhangHamilton2008\"/>\n\nIn the case of [[Pluto]]'s satellites, it has been proposed that the present near resonances are relics of a previous precise resonance that was disrupted by tidal damping of the eccentricity of Charon's orbit (see [[Pluto's natural satellites]] for details). The near resonances may be maintained by a 15% local fluctuation in the Pluto-Charon gravitational field. Thus, these near resonances may not be coincidental.\n\nThe smaller inner moon of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], [[Namaka (moon)|Namaka]], is one tenth the mass of the larger outer moon, [[Hi\u02bbiaka (moon)|Hi{{okina}}iaka]]. Namaka revolves around Haumea in 18 days in an eccentric, [[Osculating orbit|non-Keplerian]] orbit, and as of 2008 is inclined 13\u00b0 from Hi{{okina}}iaka.<ref name=\"Ragozzine&Brown2009\"/> Over the timescale of the system, it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. It appears that it has been disturbed by resonances with the more massive Hi{{okina}}iaka, due to converging orbits as it moved outward from Haumea because of tidal dissipation.

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the 12th entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, produced by and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200 million budget, but ultimately lost money of up to $120 million for the studio due to marketing and distribution costs. It was the lowest-grossing installment in the series and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents are involved in a car accident, ostensibly leaving her an orphan. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which has been critically damaged by solar flare-like energy. While saving the astronauts, Jean is struck by the energy, which she absorbs, saving her team's aircraft from destruction. As a result, her psychic powers are greatly amplified, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental blocks in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is alive and had abandoned her out of fear of her abilities. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and realizes she had rendered her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy. The belief she is responsible for her mother's death causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she lashes out against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage, but he turns her away after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|cosmic force]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean.\n\n[[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief over Raven's death, allies with Erik and his allies in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]]. Upon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to succumb to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as that Vuk intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. U.S. government troops using stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nThe train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students.

Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

and later released on home media as '''''X-Men: Dark Phoenix''''') is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] characters. It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the 12th entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, produced by and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget, but ultimately lost money due to marketing and distribution costs. It was the lowest-grossing installment in the series and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents are involved in a car accident, ostensibly leaving her an orphan. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which has been critically damaged by solar flare-like energy. While saving the astronauts, Jean is struck by the energy, which she absorbs, saving her team's aircraft from destruction. As a result, her psychic powers are greatly amplified, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental blocks in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is alive and had abandoned her out of fear of her abilities. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and realizes she had rendered her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy. The belief she is responsible for her mother's death causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she lashes out against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage, but he turns her away after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|cosmic force]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean.\n\n[[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief over Raven's death, allies with Erik and his allies in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]]. Upon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to succumb to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as that Vuk intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. U.S. government troops using stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nThe train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival.

Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities.

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> but in late pre-production, the studio canceled the second film, and Kinberg had to make major changes to the first film\u2019s script.<ref name=\"deadline-bomb\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/06/dark-phoenix-bombs-at-the-box-office-reasons-why-1202629749/|title=\u2018Dark Phoenix\u2019 Bound To Lose $100M+ After Worst Domestic Opening In \u2018X-Men\u2019 Series: Here\u2019s Why|first1=Anthony|last1=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Chris Claremont also confirmed the two-film plan and revealed that they would have been titled ''Phoenix'' and ''Dark Phoenix''.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre. When Kinberg approached him at a concert to talk about his vision for ''Dark Phoenix'', Zimmer realized that the story was one that he wanted to help tell, and that the film was an opportunity for something that he had always wanted to try in a film score; he decided to join the production.<ref name=\"ZimmerExplanation\" /> In writing the film's score, Zimmer wrote new themes for the X-Men, Magneto, and the Phoenix, and chose to omit previously established themes written by previous composer [[John Ottman]].\n\nOn May 23, 2019, the track \"Extraordinary Being\" by [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] was released as the official soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite AV Media |last=EmeliSandeVEVO |title=Emeli Sand\u00e9 - Extraordinary Being \u2013 In Collaboration with X-Men: Dark Phoenix |date=May 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnYsk7jfUTE |via= [[YouTube]] |access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack was released digitally on June 7.

{"title_page": "Hand-colouring of photographs", "text_new": "{{About|colourisation of still images|colourisation\nof moving-picture images|Film colorization}}\n{{Short description|Manually applying colour to black-and-white photographs}}\n[[Image:Hand-coloured daguerreotype.jpg|thumb|A hand-coloured daguerreotype by J. Garnier, c. 1850]]\n\n'''Hand-colouring''' (or '''hand-coloring''') refers to any method of manually adding colour to a [[black-and-white]] [[photograph]], generally either to heighten the realism of the photograph or for artistic purposes.<ref>[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=coloring&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=-1&checked=300133555 Art & Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. \"hand coloring\"]. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Hand-colouring is also known as hand painting or overpainting.\n\nTypically, [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[crayons]] or [[pastels]], and other [[paint]]s or [[dye]]s are applied to the image surface using [[brush]]es, fingers, [[cotton swab]]s or [[airbrush]]es. Hand-coloured photographs were most popular in the mid- to late-19th century before the invention of [[color photography|colour photography]] and some firms specialised in producing hand-coloured photographs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[Monochrome]] (black and white) [[photography]] was first exemplified by the [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: [[calotype]], [[ambrotype]], [[tintype]], [[albumen print]] and [[Gelatin-silver process|gelatin silver print]]. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing [[color photography|colour photography]] as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of [[cyanotype]]s.\n\nIn an attempt to create more realistic images, photographers and artists would hand-colour monochrome photographs. \nThe first hand-coloured daguerreotypes are attributed to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] painter and printmaker [[Johann Baptist Isenring]], who used a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[pigment]]s to colour daguerreotypes soon after their invention in 1839.<ref>Henisch, H.K. & Henisch, B. (1996). ''The painted photograph 1939-1914: Origins, techniques, aspirations''. Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 21.</ref> Coloured powder was fixed on the delicate surface of the daguerreotype by the application of heat. Variations of this technique were patented in [[England]] by [[Richard Beard (photographer)|Richard Beard]] in 1842 and in [[France]] by \u00c9tienne Lecchi in 1842 and L\u00e9otard de Leuze in 1845. Later, hand-colouring was used with successive photographic innovations, from albumen and gelatin silver prints to [[Magic lantern|lantern slides]]<ref>Robinson, D., Herbert, S., Crangle, R., & Magic Lantern Society of Great Britain. (2001). ''Encyclopaedia of the magic lantern''. London: Magic Lantern Society, p. 73-74.</ref> and [[Transparency (photography)|transparency photography]].\n\nParallel efforts to produce coloured photographic images affected the popularity of hand-colouring. In 1842 [[Daniel Davis Jr. (photographer)|Daniel Davis Jr.]] patented a method for colouring daguerreotypes through [[electroplating]],<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 24.</ref> and his work was refined by [[Warren Thompson (photographer)|Warren Thompson]] the following year. The results of the work of Davis and Thompson were only partially successful in creating colour photographs and the electroplating method was soon abandoned. In 1850 [[Levi Hill|Levi L. Hill]] announced his invention of a process of daguerreotyping in natural colours in his ''Treatise on Daguerreotype''.<ref>Hill, L. L., & McCartey, W. (1973). A treatise on daguerreotype. ''The Literature of photography''. New York: Arno Press.</ref> Sales of conventional uncoloured and hand-coloured daguerreotypes fell in anticipation of this new technology. Hill delayed publication of the details of his process for several years, however, and his claims soon came to be considered fraudulent. When he finally did publish his treatise in 1856, the process&nbsp;\u2013 whether bona fide or not&nbsp;\u2013 was certainly impractical and dangerous.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHand-colouring remained the easiest and most effective method to produce full-colour photographic images until the mid-20th century when American [[Kodak]] introduced [[Kodachrome]] colour film.\n\n====Japanese hand-coloured photographs (circa 1860\u20131899)====\n\n{{multiple image\n | width             = 200px\n | header            = \n | image1            = Takaboko Island bw.jpg\n | caption1          = Original monochrome photo\n | image2            = Takaboko Island hc.jpg\n | caption2          = Hand-colored version\n | footer            = Print by [[Stillfried & Andersen]] between 1875 and 1885\n}}\n\nThough the hand-colouring of photographs was introduced in [[Europe]], the technique gained considerable popularity in [[Japan]], where the practice became a respected and refined art form beginning in the 1860s. It is possible that photographer Charles Parker and his artist partner William Parke Andrew were the first to produce such works in Japan, but the first to consistently employ hand-colouring in the country were the photographer [[Felice Beato]] and his partner, ''The Illustrated London News'' artist and colourist [[Charles Wirgman]].<ref name=\"Henisch. 1996. p. 201\">Henisch. (1996). p. 201.</ref> In Beato's studio the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] were successfully applied to European photography, as evidenced in Beato's volume of hand-coloured portraits, ''Native Types''.\n\nAnother notable early photographer in Japan to use hand-colouring was [[Yokoyama Matsusabur\u014d]]. Yokoyama had trained as a painter and lithographer as well as a photographer, and he took advantage of his extensive repertoire of skills and techniques to create what he called ''shashin abura-e'' (\u5199\u771f\u6cb9\u7d75) or \"photographic oil paintings\", in which the paper support of a photograph was cut away and oil paints then applied to the remaining emulsion.<ref>Yokoe, F.

Kentucky: Collector Books. p. 11.</ref> The increased demand for hand-coloured [[landscape photography]] at the beginning of the 20th century is attributed to the work of [[Wallace Nutting]].  Nutting, a New England minister, pursued hand-coloured landscape photography as a hobby until 1904, when he opened a professional studio.  He spent the next 35 years creating hand-coloured photographs, and became the best-selling hand-coloured photographer of all time.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\">Ivankovich. (2005). p. 12</ref>\n\nBetween 1915 and 1925 hand-coloured photographs were popular among the middle classes in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Bahamas as affordable and stylish wedding gifts, shower gifts, holiday gifts, friendship gifts, and vacation souvenirs. With the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, and the subsequent decrease in the numbers of the middle class, sales of hand-coloured photographs sharply diminished.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\"/>\n\nDespite their downturn in popularity, skilled photographers continued to create beautifully hand-coloured photographs.  [[Hans Bellmer|Hans Bellmer's]] hand-coloured photographs of his own doll sculptures from the 1930s provide an example of continued hand-colouring of photographs in Europe during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|title=Page Not Found|first=George Eastman|last=Museum|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194321/http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|archive-date=27 September 2007|df=}}</ref> In Poland, the [[Monid\u0142o]] is an example of popular hand-coloured wedding photographs.\n\nAnother hand-colour photographer, Luis M\u00e1rquez (1899\u20131978), was the official photographer for and art adviser of the Mexican Pavilion at the 1939-40 World\u2019s Fair. In 1937 he presented Texas Governor [[James V. Allred]] a collection of hand-coloured photographs.

The upsurge in popularity of antiques and collectibles in the 1960s, however, increased interest in hand-coloured photographs. Since about 1970 there has been something of a revival of hand-colouring, as seen in the work of such artist-photographers as Elizabeth Lennard, [[Jan Saudek]], [[Kathy Vargas]], and Rita Dibert.  [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg's]] and others' use of combined photographic and painting media in their art represents a precursor to this revival.\n\nIn spite of the availability of high-quality [[Color photography|colour processes]], hand-coloured photographs (often combined with [[sepia toning]]) are still popular for aesthetic reasons and because the pigments used have great permanence. In many countries where colour film was rare or expensive, or where colour processing was unavailable, hand-colouring continued to be used and sometimes preferred into the 1980s. More recently, [[digital image processing]] has been used&nbsp;\u2013 particularly in advertising&nbsp;\u2013 to recreate the appearance and effects of hand-colouring. Colourisation is now available to the amateur photographer using image manipulation software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].\n\n==Materials and techniques==\n[[File:Scan konghungs 2019-10-23-16-29-41 copy.jpg|thumb|Hand Coloured Picture of a Noble Manchurian Lady in 1910s China]]\n\n===Dyes===\n[[Dyes|Basic dyes]] are used in the hand-colouring of photographs.  Dyes are soluble colour substance, either natural or synthetic, in an aqueous solution, as opposed to pigments which are generally insoluble colour substance in an aqueous suspension.  [[Aniline dye]]s, the first synthetically produced dyes originally used for the dyeing of textiles, were first used to dye [[albumen print]]s and [[Transparency (photography)|glass transparency]] photographs in Germany in the 1860s.<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 65.</ref>  When hand-colouring with [[dye]]s, a weak [[solution]] of dye in water is preferred, and colours are often built up with repeated washes rather than being applied all at once. The approach is to ''stain'' or ''dye'' the print rather than to ''paint'' it, as too much paint will obscure photographic details. Blotting paper is used to control the amount of dye on the surface by absorbing any excess.\n\n===Watercolours===\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolour paint]] has the virtue of being more permanent than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours requires the use of a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring.<ref>Johnston, C. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs]. (Master\u2019s dissertation). The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.</ref> Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally [[arabic gum]]), additives to improve plasticity (such as [[glycerol|glycerine]]), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. [[water]]) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often \"leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area.\"<ref name=\"utexas2004\">Johnston. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs].</ref> Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.\n\n===Oils===\n[[Oil paint]] contains particles of pigment applied using a [[drying oil]], such as [[linseed oil]]. The conventions and techniques of using [[Oil paint|oils]] demands a knowledge of [[drawing]] and [[painting]], so it is often used in professional practice. {{citation needed span|text=When hand-colouring with oils, the approach is more often to use the photographic image simply as a base for a painted image. The ability to create accurate oil portraits using a photographic base lent itself to art crime, with some artists claiming to paint traditional oil portraits (for a higher price) when actually tracing a photograph base in oils. Therefore, the choice of oil colours is governed by the relative transparency of the pigments to allow for authentication of the photographic base.|date=December 2017}} It is necessary to [[Sizing|size]] the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic [[Magic lantern|lantern]] slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results.<ref>Robinson. (2001). p. 73-74.</ref> Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the [[Collodion process|collodion]] era&nbsp;\u2013 from 1848 to the end of the 19th century&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes watercolours were used as well.\n\n===Crayons and pastels===\nThe use of [[crayon]] or [[pastel]] sticks of ground pigments in various levels of saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques.  Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and coloured pencils are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.\n\nHand-coloured photographs sometimes include the combined use of dyes, water-colours, oils, and other pigments to create varying effects on the printed image. Regardless of which medium is used, the main tools to apply colour are the brush and fingertip. Often the dabbing finger is covered to ensure that no fingerprints are left on the image.\n\n==Preservation and storage==\n[[File:Unidentified woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A tarnished hand-coloured daguerreotype (c. 1852) from the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677483953/|title=Unidentified Woman|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>]]\nIn general, the preservation of hand-coloured photographs is similar to that of [[Color photography#Preservation issues|colour and monochrome photography]]. Optimal storage conditions include an environmentally controlled climate with low [[relative humidity]] (approximately 30-40% RH), temperatures under 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and a low concentration of [[particulate|particulate pollution]], such as [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]], and [[ozone]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Library of Congress. (2007). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/photo.html ''Caring for your photographic collections'']. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> The storage area must also be clean and free of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[mold|mould]].  Because hand-coloured photographs, like colour photographs, are more sensitive to light and UV radiation, storage should be in a dark location.  The storage area should be secure and monitored for internal threats&nbsp;\u2013 such as change in temperature or humidity due to [[HVAC]] malfunction, as well as external threats, such as [[theft]] or [[natural disaster]].  A [[Emergency management|disaster plan]] should be created and maintained for all materials.\n\nWhen handling cased photographs such as [[daguerreotypes]], [[albumen print]]s, and [[tintypes]], especially ones that have been hand-coloured, caution is required.  They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image.  Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] or buffered tissue paper.  If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and backing board can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board.  The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the backing board supports the image from behind.  This \"sandwich\" is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners should not be used on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards.  If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.<ref>[[Ritzenthaler, M. L.]], Vogt-O'Connor, D., & Ritzenthaler, L. (2006).

Like the photographs themselves, watercolours and dyes applied by hand to photographs are susceptible to light damage and must be housed in dark storage or displayed under dim, indirect light. Common particulate pollutants can cause watercolour pigments to fade, but the paint surface can be cleaned by lightly dusting with a soft brush to remove dirt.<ref>Fahey, M. (2002).

Historically, crayon and pastel coloured photographs were sold in a frame under a protective layer of glass, which was often successful in reducing the amount of handling and smudging of the photograph surface.<ref>Burns, S. B. (1995). ''Forgotten marriage: The painted tintype & the decorative frame 1860-1910: A lost chapter in American portraiture.'' New York: The Burns Press. p. 40.</ref> Any conservation work on crayon or pastel colour-photographs must retain these original frames and original glass to maintain the authenticity and value of the object. If the photograph is separated from its original enclosure, it can be stored in an archival quality folder until it is framed or cased.\n\n===Auxiliary materials===\n[[File:Carandini.jpg|thumb|upright|Hand-coloured cabinet photograph (c. 1875) from the State Library of New South Wales.

(2005). p. 251.</ref>  Early 20th century hand-coloured photographs were often mounted on [[Mat (picture framing)|mat-board]], placed behind a glass frame, and backed by wood panel slats, cardboard, or heavy paperboard.  A backing sheet was often glued to the back of the mat-board.  Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly [[acidic]] and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs.  Metallic inclusions in the paper can also [[oxidize]] which may be the cause of [[foxing]] in paper materials.  Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.\n\nSimple conservation of these fragile materials can be carried out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together.  Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic backing paper can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the backing paper.  The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting.  Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality [[acid-free paper]] paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.<ref>Ivankovich. (2005). p. 251-253.</ref>\n\n==Related techniques==\nHand-colouring should be distinguished from ''tinting'', ''toning'', ''retouching'', and ''crystoleum''.\n\n* [[Tinted photograph]]s are made with dyed [[Photographic paper|printing papers]] produced by commercial manufacturers. A single overall colour underlies the image and is most apparent in the highlights and mid-tones. From the 1870s [[albumen print|albumen]] printing papers were available in pale pink or blue, and from the 1890s gelatin-silver printing-out papers in pale mauve or pink were available. There were other kinds of tinted papers as well. Over time such colouration often becomes very faded.\n* [[Photographic print toning|Toning]] refers to a variety of methods for altering the overall colour of the photographic image itself.<ref>* [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=toning&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=-1&checked=300053423 Art & Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. \"toning (photography)\"]. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Compounds of gold, platinum or other metals are used in combination with variations in development time, temperature and other factors to produce a range of tones, including warm browns, purples, sepias, blues, olives, red-browns and blue-blacks. A well-known type of toning is [[sepia tone]]. Besides adding colour to a monochromatic print, toning often improves image stability and increases contrast.\n* [[Retouching]] uses many of the same tools and techniques as hand-colouring, but with the intent of covering damage, hiding unwanted features, accentuating details, or adding missing elements in a photographic print. In a portrait retouching could be used to improve a sitter's appearance, for instance, by removing facial blemishes, and in a landscape with an overexposed sky, clouds could be painted into the image. Water-colours, inks, dyes and chemical reducers are used with such tools as [[scalpel]]s, pointed brushes, airbrushes and retouching pencils.\n* The [[crystoleum]], from \"crystal\" + \"oleum\" (oil), process was yet another method of applying colour to albumen prints.<ref>Ritzenthaler. (2006). p. 39.</ref>  The print was pasted face down to the inside of a concave piece of glass.  Once the adhesive (usually [[starch]] paste or [[gelatin]]) was dry, the paper backing of the print was rubbed away, leaving only the transparent emulsion on the glass. The image was then coloured by hand.  Another piece of glass was added to the back and this could also be coloured by hand.  Both pieces of glass were bound together creating a detailed, albeit fragile, image.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Film colorization]]\n* [[Film tinting]]\n* [[Handschiegl color process|Handschiegl colour process]]\n* [[Photochrom|Photochrom(e)]]\n* [[Photograph conservation]]\n* [[Photo manipulation]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n* [[Selective color|Selective colour]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n[https://paintingflip.com/ Turn your Photo Into Handmade Paintings.]\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baldwin, G.

Hand-coloured photographs were most popular in the mid- to late-19th century before the invention of [[color photography|colour photography]] and some firms specialised in producing hand-coloured photographs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[Monochrome]] (black and white) [[photography]] was first exemplified by the [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: [[calotype]], [[ambrotype]], [[tintype]], [[albumen print]] and [[Gelatin-silver process|gelatin silver print]]. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing [[color photography|colour photography]] as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of [[cyanotype]]s.\n\nIn an attempt to create more realistic images, photographers and artists would hand-colour monochrome photographs. \nThe first hand-coloured daguerreotypes are attributed to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] painter and printmaker [[Johann Baptist Isenring]], who used a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[pigment]]s to colour daguerreotypes soon after their invention in 1839.<ref>Henisch, H.K. & Henisch, B. (1996). ''The painted photograph 1939-1914: Origins, techniques, aspirations''. Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 21.</ref> Coloured powder was fixed on the delicate surface of the daguerreotype by the application of heat. Variations of this technique were patented in [[England]] by [[Richard Beard (photographer)|Richard Beard]] in 1842 and in [[France]] by \u00c9tienne Lecchi in 1842 and L\u00e9otard de Leuze in 1845. Later, hand-colouring was used with successive photographic innovations, from albumen and gelatin silver prints to [[Magic lantern|lantern slides]]<ref>Robinson, D., Herbert, S., Crangle, R., & Magic Lantern Society of Great Britain. (2001). ''Encyclopaedia of the magic lantern''. London: Magic Lantern Society, p. 73-74.</ref> and [[Transparency (photography)|transparency photography]].\n\nParallel efforts to produce coloured photographic images affected the popularity of hand-colouring. In 1842 [[Daniel Davis Jr. (photographer)|Daniel Davis Jr.]] patented a method for colouring daguerreotypes through [[electroplating]],<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 24.</ref> and his work was refined by [[Warren Thompson (photographer)|Warren Thompson]] the following year. The results of the work of Davis and Thompson were only partially successful in creating colour photographs and the electroplating method was soon abandoned. In 1850 [[Levi Hill|Levi L. Hill]] announced his invention of a process of daguerreotyping in natural colours in his ''Treatise on Daguerreotype''.<ref>Hill, L. L., & McCartey, W. (1973). A treatise on daguerreotype. ''The Literature of photography''. New York: Arno Press.</ref> Sales of conventional uncoloured and hand-coloured daguerreotypes fell in anticipation of this new technology. Hill delayed publication of the details of his process for several years, however, and his claims soon came to be considered fraudulent. When he finally did publish his treatise in 1856, the process&nbsp;\u2013 whether bona fide or not&nbsp;\u2013 was certainly impractical and dangerous.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHand-colouring remained the easiest and most effective method to produce full-colour photographic images until the mid-20th century when American [[Kodak]] introduced [[Kodachrome]] colour film.\n\n====Japanese hand-coloured photographs (circa 1860\u20131899)====\n\n{{multiple image\n | width             = 200px\n | header            = \n | image1            = Takaboko Island bw.jpg\n | caption1          = Original monochrome photo\n | image2            = Takaboko Island hc.jpg\n | caption2          = Hand-colored version\n | footer            = Print by [[Stillfried & Andersen]] between 1875 and 1885\n}}\n\nThough the hand-colouring of photographs was introduced in [[Europe]], the technique gained considerable popularity in [[Japan]], where the practice became a respected and refined art form beginning in the 1860s.

(1996). p. 201.</ref> In Beato's studio the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] were successfully applied to European photography, as evidenced in Beato's volume of hand-coloured portraits, ''Native Types''.\n\nAnother notable early photographer in Japan to use hand-colouring was [[Yokoyama Matsusabur\u014d]]. Yokoyama had trained as a painter and lithographer as well as a photographer, and he took advantage of his extensive repertoire of skills and techniques to create what he called ''shashin abura-e'' (\u5199\u771f\u6cb9\u7d75) or \"photographic oil paintings\", in which the paper support of a photograph was cut away and oil paints then applied to the remaining emulsion.<ref>Yokoe, F.

Many high-quality hand-coloured photographs continued to be made in Japan well into the 20th century.\n\n===Post-1900===\n[[File:Soviet POWs Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|Digitally-colourised picture of Finnish POWs, 6th January 1940. The picture has been restored and edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]].]]\n\nThe so-called golden age of hand-coloured photography in the western hemisphere occurred between 1900 and 1940.<ref>Ivankovich, M. & Ivankovich, S. (2005). ''Early twentieth century hand-painted photography: Identification and value.'' Kentucky: Collector Books. p. 11.</ref> The increased demand for hand-coloured [[landscape photography]] at the beginning of the 20th century is attributed to the work of [[Wallace Nutting]].  Nutting, a New England minister, pursued hand-coloured landscape photography as a hobby until 1904, when he opened a professional studio.  He spent the next 35 years creating hand-coloured photographs, and became the best-selling hand-coloured photographer of all time.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\">Ivankovich. (2005). p. 12</ref>\n\nBetween 1915 and 1925 hand-coloured photographs were popular among the middle classes in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Bahamas as affordable and stylish wedding gifts, shower gifts, holiday gifts, friendship gifts, and vacation souvenirs. With the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, and the subsequent decrease in the numbers of the middle class, sales of hand-coloured photographs sharply diminished.<ref name=\"Ivankovich2005_p12\"/>\n\nDespite their downturn in popularity, skilled photographers continued to create beautifully hand-coloured photographs.  [[Hans Bellmer|Hans Bellmer's]] hand-coloured photographs of his own doll sculptures from the 1930s provide an example of continued hand-colouring of photographs in Europe during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|title=Page Not Found|first=George Eastman|last=Museum|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194321/http://www.geh.org/taschen/m198218940005.jpg|archive-date=27 September 2007|df=}}</ref> In Poland, the [[Monid\u0142o]] is an example of popular hand-coloured wedding photographs.\n\nAnother hand-colour photographer, Luis M\u00e1rquez (1899\u20131978), was the official photographer for and art adviser of the Mexican Pavilion at the 1939-40 World\u2019s Fair. In 1937 he presented Texas Governor [[James V. Allred]] a collection of hand-coloured photographs. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in Mexico City has an extensive Luis M\u00e1rquez photographic archive, as does the [[University of Houston]] in Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.uh.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=/p15195coll13|title=University of Houston Digital Library: Luis Marquez Photographs|last=|first=|date=|website=digital.lib.uh.edu|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1950s, the availability of colour film all but stopped the production of hand-coloured photographs. The upsurge in popularity of antiques and collectibles in the 1960s, however, increased interest in hand-coloured photographs. Since about 1970 there has been something of a revival of hand-colouring, as seen in the work of such artist-photographers as Elizabeth Lennard, [[Jan Saudek]], [[Kathy Vargas]], and Rita Dibert.  [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg's]] and others' use of combined photographic and painting media in their art represents a precursor to this revival.\n\nIn spite of the availability of high-quality [[Color photography|colour processes]], hand-coloured photographs (often combined with [[sepia toning]]) are still popular for aesthetic reasons and because the pigments used have great permanence. In many countries where colour film was rare or expensive, or where colour processing was unavailable, hand-colouring continued to be used and sometimes preferred into the 1980s. More recently, [[digital image processing]] has been used&nbsp;\u2013 particularly in advertising&nbsp;\u2013 to recreate the appearance and effects of hand-colouring. Colourisation is now available to the amateur photographer using image manipulation software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].\n\n==Materials and techniques==\n[[File:Scan konghungs 2019-10-23-16-29-41 copy.jpg|thumb|Hand Coloured Picture of a Noble Manchurian Lady in 1910s China]]\n\n===Dyes===\n[[Dyes|Basic dyes]] are used in the hand-colouring of photographs.  Dyes are soluble colour substance, either natural or synthetic, in an aqueous solution, as opposed to pigments which are generally insoluble colour substance in an aqueous suspension.  [[Aniline dye]]s, the first synthetically produced dyes originally used for the dyeing of textiles, were first used to dye [[albumen print]]s and [[Transparency (photography)|glass transparency]] photographs in Germany in the 1860s.<ref>Henisch. (1996). p. 65.</ref>  When hand-colouring with [[dye]]s, a weak [[solution]] of dye in water is preferred, and colours are often built up with repeated washes rather than being applied all at once. The approach is to ''stain'' or ''dye'' the print rather than to ''paint'' it, as too much paint will obscure photographic details. Blotting paper is used to control the amount of dye on the surface by absorbing any excess.\n\n===Watercolours===\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolour paint]] has the virtue of being more permanent than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours requires the use of a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring.<ref>Johnston, C. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs]. (Master\u2019s dissertation). The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.</ref> Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally [[arabic gum]]), additives to improve plasticity (such as [[glycerol|glycerine]]), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. [[water]]) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often \"leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area.\"<ref name=\"utexas2004\">Johnston. (2004). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/c-johnston-04-hand-coloring.html Hand-coloring of nineteenth century photographs].</ref> Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.\n\n===Oils===\n[[Oil paint]] contains particles of pigment applied using a [[drying oil]], such as [[linseed oil]]. The conventions and techniques of using [[Oil paint|oils]] demands a knowledge of [[drawing]] and [[painting]], so it is often used in professional practice. {{citation needed span|text=When hand-colouring with oils, the approach is more often to use the photographic image simply as a base for a painted image. The ability to create accurate oil portraits using a photographic base lent itself to art crime, with some artists claiming to paint traditional oil portraits (for a higher price) when actually tracing a photograph base in oils. Therefore, the choice of oil colours is governed by the relative transparency of the pigments to allow for authentication of the photographic base.|date=December 2017}} It is necessary to [[Sizing|size]] the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic [[Magic lantern|lantern]] slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results.<ref>Robinson. (2001). p. 73-74.</ref> Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the [[Collodion process|collodion]] era&nbsp;\u2013 from 1848 to the end of the 19th century&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes watercolours were used as well.\n\n===Crayons and pastels===\nThe use of [[crayon]] or [[pastel]] sticks of ground pigments in various levels of saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques.  Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and coloured pencils are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.\n\nHand-coloured photographs sometimes include the combined use of dyes, water-colours, oils, and other pigments to create varying effects on the printed image. Regardless of which medium is used, the main tools to apply colour are the brush and fingertip. Often the dabbing finger is covered to ensure that no fingerprints are left on the image.\n\n==Preservation and storage==\n[[File:Unidentified woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A tarnished hand-coloured daguerreotype (c. 1852) from the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677483953/|title=Unidentified Woman|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>]]\nIn general, the preservation of hand-coloured photographs is similar to that of [[Color photography#Preservation issues|colour and monochrome photography]]. Optimal storage conditions include an environmentally controlled climate with low [[relative humidity]] (approximately 30-40% RH), temperatures under 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and a low concentration of [[particulate|particulate pollution]], such as [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]], and [[ozone]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Library of Congress. (2007). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/photo.html ''Caring for your photographic collections'']. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> The storage area must also be clean and free of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[mold|mould]].  Because hand-coloured photographs, like colour photographs, are more sensitive to light and UV radiation, storage should be in a dark location.  The storage area should be secure and monitored for internal threats&nbsp;\u2013 such as change in temperature or humidity due to [[HVAC]] malfunction, as well as external threats, such as [[theft]] or [[natural disaster]].  A [[Emergency management|disaster plan]] should be created and maintained for all materials.\n\nWhen handling cased photographs such as [[daguerreotypes]], [[albumen print]]s, and [[tintypes]], especially ones that have been hand-coloured, caution is required.  They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image.  Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] or buffered tissue paper.  If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and backing board can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board.  The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the backing board supports the image from behind.  This \"sandwich\" is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners should not be used on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards.  If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.<ref>[[Ritzenthaler, M. L.]], Vogt-O'Connor, D., & Ritzenthaler, L. (2006).

Like the photographs themselves, watercolours and dyes applied by hand to photographs are susceptible to light damage and must be housed in dark storage or displayed under dim, indirect light. Common particulate pollutants can cause watercolour pigments to fade, but the paint surface can be cleaned by lightly dusting with a soft brush to remove dirt.<ref>Fahey, M. (2002).

Historically, crayon and pastel coloured photographs were sold in a frame under a protective layer of glass, which was often successful in reducing the amount of handling and smudging of the photograph surface.<ref>Burns, S. B. (1995). ''Forgotten marriage: The painted tintype & the decorative frame 1860-1910: A lost chapter in American portraiture.'' New York: The Burns Press. p. 40.</ref> Any conservation work on crayon or pastel colour-photographs must retain these original frames and original glass to maintain the authenticity and value of the object. If the photograph is separated from its original enclosure, it can be stored in an archival quality folder until it is framed or cased.\n\n===Auxiliary materials===\n[[File:Carandini.jpg|thumb|upright|Hand-coloured cabinet photograph (c. 1875) from the State Library of New South Wales. The photograph is mounted to a paper backing sheet and shows evidence of degradation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3293959164/#/|title=The Carandini ladies, one of Australia's first opera performing families, ca. 1875 / photographer Charles Hewitt (attributed)|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>]]\nIn the [[United States]], many commercially sold, hand-coloured photographs were packaged and framed for [[Retail sales|retail sale]].<ref>Ivankovich. (2005). p. 251.</ref>  Early 20th century hand-coloured photographs were often mounted on [[Mat (picture framing)|mat-board]], placed behind a glass frame, and backed by wood panel slats, cardboard, or heavy paperboard.  A backing sheet was often glued to the back of the mat-board.  Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly [[acidic]] and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs.  Metallic inclusions in the paper can also [[oxidize]] which may be the cause of [[foxing]] in paper materials.  Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.\n\nSimple conservation of these fragile materials can be carried out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together.  Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic backing paper can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the backing paper.  The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting.  Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality [[acid-free paper]] paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.<ref>Ivankovich. (2005). p. 251-253.</ref>\n\n==Related techniques==\nHand-colouring should be distinguished from ''tinting'', ''toning'', ''retouching'', and ''crystoleum''.\n\n* [[Tinted photograph]]s are made with dyed [[Photographic paper|printing papers]] produced by commercial manufacturers. A single overall colour underlies the image and is most apparent in the highlights and mid-tones. From the 1870s [[albumen print|albumen]] printing papers were available in pale pink or blue, and from the 1890s gelatin-silver printing-out papers in pale mauve or pink were available. There were other kinds of tinted papers as well. Over time such colouration often becomes very faded.\n* [[Photographic print toning|Toning]] refers to a variety of methods for altering the overall colour of the photographic image itself.<ref>* [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=toning&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=-1&checked=300053423 Art & Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. \"toning (photography)\"]. Accessed 22 November 2010.</ref> Compounds of gold, platinum or other metals are used in combination with variations in development time, temperature and other factors to produce a range of tones, including warm browns, purples, sepias, blues, olives, red-browns and blue-blacks. A well-known type of toning is [[sepia tone]]. Besides adding colour to a monochromatic print, toning often improves image stability and increases contrast.\n* [[Retouching]] uses many of the same tools and techniques as hand-colouring, but with the intent of covering damage, hiding unwanted features, accentuating details, or adding missing elements in a photographic print. In a portrait retouching could be used to improve a sitter's appearance, for instance, by removing facial blemishes, and in a landscape with an overexposed sky, clouds could be painted into the image. Water-colours, inks, dyes and chemical reducers are used with such tools as [[scalpel]]s, pointed brushes, airbrushes and retouching pencils.\n* The [[crystoleum]], from \"crystal\" + \"oleum\" (oil), process was yet another method of applying colour to albumen prints.<ref>Ritzenthaler. (2006). p. 39.</ref>  The print was pasted face down to the inside of a concave piece of glass.  Once the adhesive (usually [[starch]] paste or [[gelatin]]) was dry, the paper backing of the print was rubbed away, leaving only the transparent emulsion on the glass. The image was then coloured by hand.  Another piece of glass was added to the back and this could also be coloured by hand.  Both pieces of glass were bound together creating a detailed, albeit fragile, image.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Film colorization]]\n* [[Film tinting]]\n* [[Handschiegl color process|Handschiegl colour process]]\n* [[Photochrom|Photochrom(e)]]\n* [[Photograph conservation]]\n* [[Photo manipulation]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n* [[Selective color|Selective colour]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baldwin, G.
