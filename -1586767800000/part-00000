''Myeon'' ({{Lang|ko|\uba74}}) means \"noodles\".

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became president of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for almost 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read economics and politics before changing to read law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and  transferred to the [[West End of London|West End]] in London before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> Brooke-Taylor was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.

Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369 Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\".<ref name=BBCDeath/> Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]]. [[Paul McGann]] played the [[Eighth Doctor]], and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a [[Zygon]] taking the shape of a human.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>''Who's Who on Television'' \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in [[Berkshire]].<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref> He served the [[University of St Andrews]] as rector between 1979 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Today \u2013 Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]], Brooke-Taylor died of complications from [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 12 April 2020, aged 79.<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became president of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for almost 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read economics and politics before changing to read law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and  transferred to the [[West End of London|West End]] in London before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> Brooke-Taylor was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.

Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369 Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\".<ref name=BBCDeath/> Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]]. [[Paul McGann]] played the [[Eighth Doctor]], and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a [[Zygon]] taking the shape of a human.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>''Who's Who on Television'' \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in [[Berkshire]].<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref> He served the [[University of St Andrews]] as rector between 1979 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Today \u2013 Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]], Brooke-Taylor died of complications from [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 12 April 2020, aged 79.<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The next Kangaroo tour was staged in 1990.\n\nAustralia continued its dominance, easily winning both Test series against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[France national rugby league team|France]] as well as defeating [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in [[Port Moresby]] on the way to England, going through the entire tour undefeated in a repeat of the [[The Invincibles (rugby league)|1982 Invincibles' tour]] which saw the 1986 team became known as \"The Unbeatables\". In twenty matches they scored 136 tries and conceded only 16, posting 738 points for and 126 against.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Gallaway\n  | first = Jack\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Origin: Rugby league's greatest contest 1980 - 2002\n  | publisher = [[University of Queensland]] Press\n  | year = 2003\n  | location = \n  | pages = 93\u201394\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3nDbsx3Hk7QC&printsec=frontcover\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 9780702233838}}</ref> [[Terry Lamb]] became the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour.\n\nThe team was coached by 1956/57 Kangaroo tourist [[Don Furner]], who also coached the [[Canberra Raiders]] in the [[NSWRL]] that year. The squad was captained by [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] captain [[Wally Lewis]], the first time a [[Queensland]] based player had captained a Kangaroo tour since [[Tom Gorman (rugby league)|Tom Gorman]] led the [[1929\u201330 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]]. [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] was named as the tour's vice-captain, while the tour managers were Gordon Treichel and John Fleming.\n\n[[National Panasonic]] put up [[Australian dollar|AU$]]5,000 worth of products for the Australian player who voted as player of the tour. Team sponsor Winfield also put up $1,000 for the Australian player judged the player of the match for each Test match played on the tour.\n\n==Squad==\nOf the 28 players selected to go on the tour 23 were from clubs of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] and 5 were from clubs of the [[Brisbane Rugby League]]. This was the last time players from the Queensland-based competition were selected for a Kangaroo tour.\n\nThere were a couple of notable omissions from the touring team. [[Parramatta Eels]] test winger [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] had originally been selected in the side and even had pre-tour publicity photos taken with the rest of the team. However he was ruled out late with the recurrence of a knee injury and his place was taken by young [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] halfback [[Greg Alexander]]. The other was regular Australian vice-captain [[Wayne Pearce]] who had ruptured his [[Anterior cruciate ligament]] during the [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series]] against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] in July. Despite an intense rehabilitation program, and being passed as fit by his surgeon, Dr Merv Cross, Pearce was ruled out of the tour by team medico Dr Bill Monoghan after a pre-tour team physical conducted at [[Redfern Oval]] in [[Sydney]].\n\nSurprisingly, the [[1986 NSWRL season|1986 NSWRL]] [[Winfield Cup]] premiers Parramatta only supplied two players to the Kangaroos squad (vice-captain [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] and [[Brett Kenny]]). Conversely, the 1986 [[Brisbane Rugby League|Brisbane]] premiers [[Wynnum-Manly Seagulls|Wynnum-Manly]] supplied four players to the squad (captain [[Wally Lewis]], [[Greg Dowling]], [[Bob Lindner]] and [[Gene Miles]]). With the exception of Dowling who did not play the pre-tour test against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], all six 1986 premiership winners played in each test on the tour.\n\n''<small>NOTE: Statistics only show games in Great Britain and France and do not include the test against Papua New Guinea</small>''\n{{s-start}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"\n| '''Player'''\n|

Leeds' centre pairing for the game were [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]] imports [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] and [[Mark McGaw]] who would play against Leeds for Australia on the [[1990 Kangaroo tour]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP61cHBNqVw 1986 Leeds vs Australia highlights]</ref>\n----\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Tuesday, 21 October\n| time       = \n| team1      = [[Cumbria rugby league team|Cumbria]] {{flagicon|Cumbria}}\n| score      = 12 \u2013 48\n| report     = <ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1986/game-4/cumbria-vs-australia.html Cumbria vs Australia]</ref>\n| team2      = {{leagueicon|Australia|16}} [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]]\n| points1    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Graeme Cameron (rugby league)|Graeme Cameron]], [[Les Holliday]] <br> '''Goals:''' <br> Graeme Cameron (2)\n| points2    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Greg Alexander]] (3), [[Terry Lamb]] (3), [[Dale Shearer]] (2), [[Gary Belcher]], [[Mal Meninga]] <br> '''Goals:''' <br> Terry Lamb (3) <br> [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] (1)\n| stadium    = [[Craven Park, Barrow-in-Furness|Craven Park]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n| attendance = 4,233\n| referee    = John McDonald\n| manofmatch = [[Les Davidson]] {{leagueicon|Australia|16}}\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _butcher stripes white\n |pattern_b  = _butcher stripes white\n |pattern_ra = _butcher stripes white\n |pattern_sh = \n |pattern_so = _hoops_black\n |leftarm    = 000000\n |body       = 000000\n |rightarm   = 000000\n |shorts     = FFFFFF\n |socks      = FFFFFF\n |title      = Cumbria\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _goldborder\n |pattern_b  = _kangaroos1\n |pattern_ra = _goldborder\n |pattern_sh = _thingoldsides\n |pattern_so = _hoops_gold\n |leftarm    = 023E00\n |body       = 023E00\n |rightarm   = 023E00\n |shorts     = 023E00\n |socks      = 023E00\n |title      = Australia\n}}\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Workington|12}} [[Gary Smith (rugby league)|Gary Smith]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|Barrow|12}} [[Michael James (rugby league)|Michael James]]\n|-\n|CE ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|France|12}} [[Kevin Pape]]\n|-\n|CE ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Barrow|12}} [[Tony Kay (rugby league)|Tony Kay]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|Workington|12}} [[David Beck (rugby league)|David Beck]]\n|-\n|SO ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Whitehaven|12}} [[Graeme Cameron (rugby league)|Graeme Cameron]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|SH ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Barrow|12}} [[David Cairns (rugby league)|David Cairns]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Barrow|12}} [[David Kendall (rugby league)|David Kendall]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Workington|12}} [[Colin Falcon]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Whitehaven|12}} [[Jeff Simpson (rugby league)|Jeff Simpson]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Barrow|12}} [[Stephen Mossop]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Swinton|12}} [[Les Holliday]]\n|-\n|LF ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Leigh|12}} [[Milton Huddart]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Whitehaven|12}} [[Norman Lofthouse]]\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||{{leagueicon|Workington|12}} [[Bill Pattison]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Canberra|12}} [[Gary Belcher]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|Manly|12}} [[Dale Shearer]]\n|-\n|CE ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Chris Mortimer]]\n|-\n|CE ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Canberra|12}} [[Mal Meninga]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|St George|12}} [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]]\n|-\n|FE ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Terry Lamb]]\n|-\n|HB ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Old Penrith|12}} [[Greg Alexander]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Manly|12}} [[Phil Daley]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Balmain|12}} [[Benny Elias]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Norths|12}} [[Martin Bella]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Souths|12}} [[Les Davidson]]\n|-\n|LK ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Paul Langmack]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Balmain|12}} [[Paul Sironen]]\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Don Furner]]\n|}\n|}\n\nThe Kangaroos only match against a full county lineup was played in front of the English leg's smallest crowd of just 4,233 at Craven Park in Barrow-in-Furness.

Wet and windy conditions were the order of the day at Old Trafford as Gene Miles (who completely out-played Ellery Hanley) and Michael O'Connor crossed for 3 tries each. O'Connor also contributed 5 goals in the tricky conditions for a personal haul of 22 points as the Australian's took a 1-0 series lead with a convincing 38-16 win. Although soundly beaten, the Lions gave their fans something to cheer in the second half by providing something of a fightback, culminating in Joe Lydon sprinting 60 metres and out-pacing Garry Jack to score in the corner. Lydon's try created Ashes history as it was the first time in 97 tests between the two sides that a British fullback had scored a try.\n\n{{-}}\n----\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 29

The Lions only try came late in the game. Australia led 34-0 when Kangaroos fullback [[Garry Jack]], who had scored two tries, pushed a pass 10 metres from his line to [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]]. The Aussie winger dropped the ball (which was bullet like and at his knees) and it was pounced upon by Schofield who scored only 15 metres wide of the posts. [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]] missed the relatively easy conversion of his team's only try, summing up the Lions day. Such was the Kangaroos dominance that this was the only kick at goal the Lions managed throughout the match.\n\n[[Bob Lindner]] scored the opening try of the game after backing up a strong burst up the middle by [[Noel Cleal]]. O'Connor converted the try and was also next to score after taking a cut-out pass from [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] near his own quarter line. After racing around the Lions defence, O'Connor kicked ahead as [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] loomed and easily won the 55 metre race to the ball for the try. He converted his own try to give Australia a 12-0 lead which they took into half time. The floodgates opened in the second though and the Kangaroos blew the Lions away with a powerful performance. Two tries to Garry Jack and one each to [[Wally Lewis]] and [[Brett Kenny]] saw Australia leading 34-0 before Schofield's try at least gave the crowd something to cheer. Before Kenny's try with the score at 28-0, the crowd, far from impressed with the Lions performance, had even begun to chant \"What a load of rubbish\" (clearly audible on the television coverage) and were actually applauding the Kangaroos open style of play.\n\nIn his television commentary of the game, former Australian [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-rugby international]] and [[1959-60 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1959-60 Kangaroo tour]] vice-captain [[Rex Mossop]] summed up the game when calling Brett Kenny's try, stating that ''\"Australia carved them up. They've decimated, dissected and absolutely diabolically destroyed this Great Britain side today\"''.\n{{-}}\n----\n\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 12 November\n| time       = \n| team1

The match saw the most even spread of Australia's \"Kangaroos\" and \"Emu's\" (midweek) teams on the tour with 7 non-test and 8 test players in the selected XV.\n----\n\n===3rd Ashes Test===\nThis match also counted as part of the [[1985\u201388 Rugby League World Cup]] and was the only match of the series played at a regular rugby league ground, the first two Tests having been played in [[soccer]] stadiums to take advantage of the greater spectator capacity. It was also the last Ashes Test in England played at a club home ground until the [[2001 Kangaroo tour]].\n\nThe only Australian team change from the second Test win was [[Mal Meninga]] coming off the bench into the second row to replace the injured [[Noel Cleal]] (broken arm) with [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] forward [[Les Davidson]] named on the bench in his Test debut. With the loss of Cleal, Australian coach [[Don Furner]] was mulling over whom to replace him with when team captain [[Wally Lewis]] suggested moving Meninga to the back row, reasoning that there would be little disruption to the team as both Mal and \"Crusher\" Cleal were roughly the same size and were fast, skilled players who played a similar style of game. After heavy criticism of his selections for the first two tests from a number of former Great Britain internationals, Maurice Bamford made five changes to the Lions with the recall of halfback [[Andy Gregory]], centre [[David Stephenson]], winger [[John Basnett]] and back rowers [[Christopher Burton|Chris Burton]] and [[Harry Pinner]].\n\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n| bg         = #eeeeee\n| team1      = {{rl-rt|GBR}}\n| team2      = {{rl|AUS}}\n| score      = 15 \u2013 24\n| report     = <ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/ashes-series-1986/game-3/great-britain-vs-australia/summary.html 3rd Test - Great Britain vs Australia]</ref>\n| points1    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Garry Schofield]] (2) <br> <br> <br> <br> '''Goals:''' <br> [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] (2/3) <br> [[Henderson Gill]] (1/1) <br> '''Field Goals:''' <br> Garry Schofield (1)\n| points2    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Gene Miles]] <br> [[Bob Lindner]] <br> [[Dale Shearer]] <br> [[Wally Lewis]] <br> '''Goals:''' <br> [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] (4/5)\n| date       = Saturday, 22 November 1986\n| stadium    = [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]]\n| attendance = 20,169\n| referee    = Julien Rascagneres {{flagicon|FRA}}\n| manofmatch = [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] {{leagueicon|Australia|16}}\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _GBRL\n |pattern_b  = _GBR1985\n |pattern_ra = _blue_stripes2\n |pattern_sh = _red_stripes2\n |pattern_so = _band_red\n |leftarm    = FFFFFF\n |body       = FFFFFF\n |rightarm   = FFFFFF\n |shorts     = 0000FF\n |socks      = 0000FF\n |title      = Great Britain\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _goldborder_2\n |pattern_b  = _kangaroos1\n |pattern_ra = _goldborder\n |pattern_sh = _thingoldsides\n |pattern_so = _hoops_gold\n |leftarm    = 023E00\n |body       = 023E00\n |rightarm   = 023E00\n |shorts     = 023E00\n |socks      = 023E00\n |title      = Australia\n}}\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Henderson Gill]]\n|-\n|RC ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|Hull|12}} [[Garry Schofield]]\n|-\n|LC ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[David Stephenson]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[John Basnett]]\n|-\n|SO ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[Tony Myler]]\n|-\n|SH ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Andy Gregory]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Castleford|12}} [[Kevin Ward (rugby league)|Kevin Ward]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Hull KR|12}} [[David Watkinson]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Hull|12}} [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Hull KR|12}} [[Christopher Burton|Chris Burton]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Andy Goodway]]\n|-\n|LK ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[Ian Potter (rugby league)|Ian Potter]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} ''[[Shaun Edwards]]''\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Ian Potter (rugby league)|Ian Potter]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Maurice Bamford]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Balmain|12}} [[Garry Jack]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|St George|12}} [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]]\n|-\n|RC ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|Parramatta|12}} [[Brett Kenny]]\n|-\n|LC ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Gene Miles]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|Manly|12}} [[Dale Shearer]]\n|-\n|FE ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Wally Lewis]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|HB ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Parramatta|12}} [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Greg Dowling]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Old Penrith|12}} [[Royce Simmons]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Canberra|12}} [[Mal Meninga]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Redcliffe|12}} [[Bryan Niebling]]\n|-\n|LF ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Bob Lindner]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Terry Lamb]]\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||{{leagueicon|Souths|12}} [[Les Davidson]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Don Furner]]\n|}\n|}\n\nAs with the 1982 Ashes series, the third Test was the most genuinely contested of the Tests played, with the Lions putting in a much improved performance. Centre [[Gene Miles]] opened the scoring in the early minutes of the game, with lock forward [[Bob Lindner]] also scoring soon after. Successful conversions by [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] saw the Kangaroos lead 12-0 after just 15 minutes and another rout looked on the cards. However, the Lions dug deep and tries to [[Garry Schofield]] either side of half time saw the game tied at 12-all with the Lions looking like winners for the first time in the series. The game was in the balance until French referee Julien Rascagneres awarded a penalty try to Australian winger [[Dale Shearer]] after he was illegally tackled by his opposite [[John Basnett]] when both were chasing the ball which Shearer had kicked downfield. A penalty goal to [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] and a field goal by Schofield reduced the deficit to 18-15, but Wally Lewis then put the result beyond doubt with a try after bamboozling the Lions defence with two dummies near the sideline before racing around to score beside the posts.\n{{-}}\n\n==France==\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 26 November\n| time       = \n| team1

against British and French teams, in addition to the [[Rugby league#Competitions|Test matches]]. The next Kangaroo tour was staged in 1990.\n\nAustralia continued its dominance, easily winning both Test series against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[France national rugby league team|France]] as well as defeating [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in [[Port Moresby]] on the way to England, going through the entire tour undefeated in a repeat of the [[The Invincibles (rugby league)|1982 Invincibles' tour]] which saw the 1986 team became known as \"The Unbeatables\".

The squad was captained by [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] captain [[Wally Lewis]], the first time a [[Queensland]] based player had captained a Kangaroo tour since [[Tom Gorman (rugby league)|Tom Gorman]] led the [[1929\u201330 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]]. [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] was named as the tour's vice-captain, while the tour managers were Gordon Treichel and John Fleming.\n\n[[National Panasonic]] put up [[Australian dollar|AU$]]5,000 worth of products for the Australian player who voted as player of the tour. Team sponsor Winfield also put up $1,000 for the Australian player judged the player of the match for each Test match played on the tour.\n\n==Squad==\nOf the 28 players selected to go on the tour 23 were from clubs of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] and 5 were from clubs of the [[Brisbane Rugby League]]. This was the last time players from the Queensland-based competition were selected for a Kangaroo tour.\n\nThere were a couple of notable omissions from the touring team. [[Parramatta Eels]] test winger [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] had originally been selected in the side and even had pre-tour publicity photos taken with the rest of the team. However he was ruled out late with the recurrence of a knee injury and his place was taken by young [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] halfback [[Greg Alexander]]. The other was regular Australian vice-captain [[Wayne Pearce]] who had ruptured his [[Anterior cruciate ligament]] during the [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series]] against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] in July. Despite an intense rehabilitation program, and being passed as fit by his surgeon, Dr Merv Cross, Pearce was ruled out of the tour by team medico Dr Bill Monoghan after a pre-tour team physical conducted at [[Redfern Oval]] in [[Sydney]].\n\nSurprisingly, the [[1986 NSWRL season|1986 NSWRL]] [[Winfield Cup]] premiers Parramatta only supplied two players to the Kangaroos squad (vice-captain [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] and [[Brett Kenny]]). Conversely, the 1986 [[Brisbane Rugby League|Brisbane]] premiers [[Wynnum-Manly Seagulls|Wynnum-Manly]] supplied four players to the squad (captain [[Wally Lewis]], [[Greg Dowling]], [[Bob Lindner]] and [[Gene Miles]]). With the exception of Dowling who did not play the pre-tour test against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], all six 1986 premiership winners played in each test on the tour.\n\n''<small>NOTE: Statistics only show games in Great Britain and France and do not include the test against Papua New Guinea</small>''\n{{s-start}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"\n| '''Player'''\n|

Wet and windy conditions were the order of the day at Old Trafford as Gene Miles (who completely out-played Ellery Hanley) and Michael O'Connor crossed for 3 tries each. O'Connor also contributed 5 goals in the tricky conditions for a personal haul of 22 points as the Australian's took a 1-0 series lead with a convincing 38-16 win. Although soundly beaten, the Lions gave their fans something to cheer in the second half by providing something of a fightback, culminating in Joe Lydon sprinting 60 metres and out-pacing Garry Jack to score in the corner. Lydon's try created Ashes history as it was the first time in 97 tests between the two sides that a British fullback had scored a try.\n\n{{-}}\n----\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 29

The Lions only try came late in the game. Australia led 34-0 when Kangaroos fullback [[Garry Jack]], who had scored two tries, pushed a pass 10 metres from his line to [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]]. The Aussie winger dropped the ball (which was bullet like and at his knees) and it was pounced upon by Schofield who scored only 15 metres wide of the posts. [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]] missed the relatively easy conversion of his teams only try, summing up the Lions day. Such was the Kangaroos dominance that this was the only kick at goal the Lions managed throughout the match.\n\n[[Bob Lindner]] scored the opening try of the game after backing up a strong burst up the middle by [[Noel Cleal]]. O'Connor converted the try and was also next to score after taking a cut-out pass from [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] near his own quarter line. After racing around the Lions defence, O'Connor kicked ahead as [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] loomed and easily won the 55 metre race to the ball for the try. He converted his own try to give Australia a 12-0 lead which they took into half time. The floodgates opened in the second though and the Kangaroos blew the Lions away with a powerful performance. Two tries to Garry Jack and one each to [[Wally Lewis]] and [[Brett Kenny]] saw Australia leading 34-0 before Schofield's try at least gave the crowd something to cheer. Before Kenny's try with the score at 28-0, the crowd, far from impressed with the Lions performance, had even begun to chant \"What a load of rubbish\" (clearly audible on the television coverage) and were actually applauding the Kangaroos open style of play.\n\nIn his television commentary of the game, former Australian [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-rugby international]] and [[1959-60 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1959-60 Kangaroo tour]] vice-captain [[Rex Mossop]] summed up the game when calling Brett Kenny's try, stating that ''\"Australia carved them up. They've decimated, dissected and absolutely diabolically destroyed this Great Britain side today\"''.\n{{-}}\n----\n\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 12 November\n| time       = \n| team1

The match saw the most even spread of Australia's \"Kangaroos\" and \"Emu's\" (midweek) teams on the tour with 7 non-test and 8 test players in the selected XV.\n----\n\n===3rd Ashes Test===\nThis match also counted as part of the [[1985\u201388 Rugby League World Cup]] and was the only match of the series played at a regular rugby league ground, the first two Tests having been played in [[soccer]] stadiums to take advantage of the greater spectator capacity. It was also the last Ashes Test in England played at a club home ground until the [[2001 Kangaroo tour]].\n\nThe only Australian team change from the second Test win was [[Mal Meninga]] coming off the bench into the second row to replace the injured [[Noel Cleal]] (broken arm) with [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] forward [[Les Davidson]] named on the bench in his Test debut. With the loss of Cleal, Australian coach [[Don Furner]] was mulling over whom to replace him with when team captain [[Wally Lewis]] suggested moving Meninga to the back row, reasoning that there would be little disruption to the team as both Mal and \"Crusher\" Cleal were roughly the same size and were fast, skilled players who played a similar style of game. After heavy criticism of his selections for the first two tests from a number of former Great Britain internationals, Maurice Bamford made five changes to the Lions with the recall of halfback [[Andy Gregory]], centre [[David Stephenson]], winger [[John Basnett]] and back rowers [[Christopher Burton|Chris Burton]] and [[Harry Pinner]].\n\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n| bg         = #eeeeee\n| team1      = {{rl-rt|GBR}}\n| team2      = {{rl|AUS}}\n| score      = 15 \u2013 24\n| report     = <ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/ashes-series-1986/game-3/great-britain-vs-australia/summary.html 3rd Test - Great Britain vs Australia]</ref>\n| points1    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Garry Schofield]] (2) <br> <br> <br> <br> '''Goals:''' <br> [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] (2/3) <br> [[Henderson Gill]] (1/1) <br> '''Field Goals:''' <br> Garry Schofield (1)\n| points2    = '''Tries:''' <br> [[Gene Miles]] <br> [[Bob Lindner]] <br> [[Dale Shearer]] <br> [[Wally Lewis]] <br> '''Goals:''' <br> [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] (4/5)\n| date       = Saturday, 22 November 1986\n| stadium    = [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]]\n| attendance = 20,169\n| referee    = Julien Rascagneres {{flagicon|FRA}}\n| manofmatch = [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] {{leagueicon|Australia|16}}\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _GBRL\n |pattern_b  = _GBR1985\n |pattern_ra = _blue_stripes2\n |pattern_sh = _red_stripes2\n |pattern_so = _band_red\n |leftarm    = FFFFFF\n |body       = FFFFFF\n |rightarm   = FFFFFF\n |shorts     = 0000FF\n |socks      = 0000FF\n |title      = Great Britain\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _goldborder_2\n |pattern_b  = _kangaroos1\n |pattern_ra = _goldborder\n |pattern_sh = _thingoldsides\n |pattern_so = _hoops_gold\n |leftarm    = 023E00\n |body       = 023E00\n |rightarm   = 023E00\n |shorts     = 023E00\n |socks      = 023E00\n |title      = Australia\n}}\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Henderson Gill]]\n|-\n|RC ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|Hull|12}} [[Garry Schofield]]\n|-\n|LC ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[David Stephenson]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[John Basnett]]\n|-\n|SO ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[Tony Myler]]\n|-\n|SH ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Andy Gregory]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Castleford|12}} [[Kevin Ward (rugby league)|Kevin Ward]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Hull KR|12}} [[David Watkinson]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Hull|12}} [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Hull KR|12}} [[Christopher Burton|Chris Burton]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Andy Goodway]]\n|-\n|LK ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Widnes|12}} [[Ian Potter (rugby league)|Ian Potter]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} ''[[Shaun Edwards]]''\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||{{leagueicon|Wigan|12}} [[Ian Potter (rugby league)|Ian Potter]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Maurice Bamford]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||'''1'''||{{leagueicon|Balmain|12}} [[Garry Jack]]\n|-\n|LW ||'''2'''||{{leagueicon|St George|12}} [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]]\n|-\n|RC ||'''3'''||{{leagueicon|Parramatta|12}} [[Brett Kenny]]\n|-\n|LC ||'''4'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Gene Miles]]\n|-\n|RW ||'''5'''||{{leagueicon|Manly|12}} [[Dale Shearer]]\n|-\n|FE ||'''6'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Wally Lewis]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])\n|-\n|HB ||'''7'''||{{leagueicon|Parramatta|12}} [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''8'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Greg Dowling]]\n|-\n|HK ||'''9'''||{{leagueicon|Old Penrith|12}} [[Royce Simmons]]\n|-\n|PR ||'''10'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''11'''||{{leagueicon|Canberra|12}} [[Mal Meninga]]\n|-\n|SR ||'''12'''||{{leagueicon|Redcliffe|12}} [[Bryan Niebling]]\n|-\n|LF ||'''13'''||{{leagueicon|Wynnum|12}} [[Bob Lindner]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|IC ||'''14'''||{{leagueicon|Bulldogs|12}} [[Terry Lamb]]\n|-\n|IC ||'''15'''||{{leagueicon|Souths|12}} [[Les Davidson]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Coach:'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Don Furner]]\n|}\n|}\n\nAs with the 1982 Ashes series, the third Test was the most genuinely contested of the Tests played, with the Lions putting in a much improved performance. Centre [[Gene Miles]] opened the scoring in the early minutes of the game, with lock forward [[Bob Lindner]] also scoring soon after. Successful conversions by [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] saw the Kangaroos lead 12-0 after just 15 minutes and another rout looked on the cards. However, the Lions dug deep and tries to [[Garry Schofield]] either side of half time saw the game tied at 12-all with the Lions looking like winners for the first time in the series. The game was in the balance until French referee Julien Rascagneres awarded a penalty try to Australian winger [[Dale Shearer]] after he was illegally tackled by his opposite [[John Basnett]] when both were chasing the ball which Shearer had kicked downfield. A penalty goal to [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] and a field goal by Schofield reduced the deficit to 18-15, but Wally Lewis then put the result beyond doubt with a try after bamboozling the Lions defence with two dummies near the sideline before racing around to score beside the posts.\n{{-}}\n\n==France==\n{{rugbyleaguebox\n| date       = Wednesday, 26 November\n| time       = \n| team1

When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through  the material as they do in an [[electrical conductor]] but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing '''dielectric polarization'''. Because of dielectric [[Polarization density|polarization]], positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field (for example, if the field is moving in the positive x-axis, the negative charges will shift in the negative x-axis). This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself.<ref name=britannica1/> If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarized, but also reorient so that their [[Symmetry axis|symmetry axes]] align to the field.<ref name=britannica1/>\n\nThe study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials.<ref>[[Arthur R. von Hippel]], in his seminal work, ''Dielectric Materials and Applications'', stated: \"''Dielectrics''... are not a narrow class of so-called insulators, but the broad expanse of ''nonmetals'' considered from the standpoint of their interaction with electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields. Thus we are concerned with gases as well as with liquids and solids, and with the storage of electric and magnetic energy as well as its dissipation.\" (Technology Press of MIT and John Wiley, NY, 1954).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thoms|first1=E.|last2=Sippel|first2=P.|last3=et.|first3=al.|title=Dielectric study on mixtures of ionic liquids|journal=Sci.

The term insulator is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while the term dielectric is used to indicate the [[Energy storage|energy]] storing capacity of the material (by means of polarization). A common example of a dielectric is the electrically insulating material between the metallic plates of a [[capacitor]]. The polarization of the dielectric by the applied electric field increases the capacitor's surface charge for the given electric field strength.<ref name=britannica1>[https://global.britannica.com/science/dielectric Dielectric].

This, in turn, determines the electric [[permittivity]] of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of [[capacitor]]s to the [[speed of light]].\n\nIt is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a [[tensor]]) relating an electric field '''E''' to the induced dielectric [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] '''P''' such that\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P} = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e \\mathbf{E},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]].\n\nThe susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' by\n\n:<math>\\chi_e\\ = \\varepsilon_r - 1.</math>\n\nSo in the case of a vacuum,\n\n:<math>\\chi_e\\ = 0.</math>\n\nThe [[electric displacement]] '''D''' is related to the polarization density '''P''' by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\left(1 + \\chi_e\\right) \\mathbf{E} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\mathbf{E}.\n</math>\n\n===Dispersion and causality===\nIn general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field. The more general formulation as a function of time is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\chi_e\\left(t - t'\\right) \\mathbf{E}\\left(t'\\right)\\, dt'.</math>\n\nThat is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t''). The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|\u0394''t'' < 0}}. An instantaneous response corresponds to [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>\u03b4''(\u0394''t'')}}.\n\nIt is more convenient in a linear system to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Due to the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}(\\omega).</math>\n\nThe susceptibility (or equivalently the permittivity) is frequency dependent. The change of susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|\u0394''t'' < 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation|Kramers\u2013Kronig constraints]] on the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(''\u03c9'').\n\n==Dielectric polarization==<!--Dielectric polarization redirects here-->\n\n===Basic atomic model===\n\n[[Image:dielectric model.svg|right|thumb|400px|Electric field interaction with an atom under the classical dielectric model.]]\n\nIn the classical approach to the dielectric model, a material is made up of atoms. Each atom consists of a cloud of negative charge (electrons) bound to and surrounding a positive point charge at its centre. In the presence of an electric field the charge cloud is distorted, as shown in the top right of the figure.\n\nThis can be reduced to a simple [[dipole]] using the [[superposition principle]]. A dipole is characterized by its [[electrical dipole moment|dipole moment]], a vector quantity shown in the figure as the blue arrow labeled ''M''. It is the relationship between the electric field and the dipole moment that gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric. (Note that the dipole moment points in the same direction as the electric field in the figure. This isn't always the case, and is a major simplification, but is true for many materials.)\n\nWhen the electric field is removed the atom returns to its original state. The time required to do so is the so-called [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] time; an exponential decay.\n\nThis is the essence of the model in physics. The behavior of the dielectric now depends on the situation. The more complicated the situation, the richer the model must be to accurately describe the behavior. Important questions are:\n*Is the electric field constant or does it vary with time? At what rate?\n*Does the response depend on the direction of the applied field ([[isotropy]] of the material)?\n*Is the response the same everywhere ([[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the material)?\n*Do any boundaries or interfaces have to be taken into account?\n*Is the response [[Linear system|linear]] with respect to the field, or are there [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]]?\n\nThe relationship between the electric field '''E''' and the dipole moment '''M''' gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric, which, for a given material, can be characterized by the function '''F''' defined by the equation:\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{E})</math>.\n\nWhen both the type of electric field and the type of material have been defined, one then chooses the simplest function ''F'' that correctly predicts the phenomena of interest. Examples of phenomena that can be so modeled include:\n\n*[[Refractive index]]\n*[[Group velocity dispersion]]\n*[[Birefringence]]\n*[[Self-focusing]]\n*[[Harmonic generation]]\n\n===Dipolar polarization=== <!--Dipolar polarization redirects here-->\nDipolar polarization is a polarization that is either inherent to [[polar molecule]]s ('''orientation polarization'''), or can be induced in any molecule in which the asymmetric distortion of the nuclei is possible ('''distortion polarization'''). Orientation polarization results from a permanent dipole, e.g., that arising from the 104.45\u00b0 angle between the asymmetric bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the water molecule, which retains polarization in the absence of an external electric field. The assembly of these dipoles forms a macroscopic polarization.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied, the distance between charges within each permanent dipole, which is related to [[chemical bond]]ing, remains constant in orientation polarization; however, the direction of polarization itself rotates. This rotation occurs on a timescale that depends on the [[torque]] and surrounding local [[viscosity]] of the molecules. Because the rotation is not instantaneous, dipolar polarizations lose the response to electric fields at the highest frequencies. A molecule rotates about 1 radian per picosecond in a fluid, thus this loss occurs at about 10<sup>11</sup> Hz (in the microwave region). The delay of the response to the change of the electric field causes [[friction]] and heat.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied at [[infrared]] frequencies or less, the molecules are bent and stretched by the field and the molecular dipole moment changes. The molecular vibration frequency is roughly the inverse of the time it takes for the molecules to bend, and this '''distortion polarization''' disappears above the infrared.\n\n===Ionic polarization=== <!--Ionic polarization redirects here-->\nIonic polarization is polarization caused by relative displacements between positive and negative [[ion]]s in [[ionic crystal]]s (for example, [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]).\n\nIf a crystal or molecule consists of atoms of more than one kind, the distribution of charges around an atom in the crystal or molecule leans to positive or negative. As a result, when lattice vibrations or molecular vibrations induce relative displacements of the atoms, the centers of positive and negative charges are also displaced. The locations of these centers are affected by the symmetry of the displacements. When the centers don't correspond, polarization arises in molecules or crystals. This polarization is called '''ionic polarization'''.\n\nIonic polarization causes the [[ferroelectric effect]] as well as [[dipolar polarization]]. The ferroelectric transition, which is caused by the lining up of the orientations of permanent dipoles along a particular direction, is called an '''order-disorder phase transition'''. The transition caused by ionic polarizations in crystals is called a '''displacive phase transition'''.\n\n====In cells====\nIonic polarization enables the production of energy-rich compounds in cells (the [[proton pump]] in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]) and, at the [[plasma membrane]], the establishment of the [[resting potential]], energetically unfavourable transport of ions, and cell-to-cell communication (the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]]).\n\nAll cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized \u2013 in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's [[plasma membrane]], known as the [[membrane potential]]. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between [[Ion transporter|ion transporters]] and [[ion channels]].\n\nIn neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the [[dendrite]]s, [[axon]], and [[soma (biology)|cell body]] different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not.\n\n==Dielectric dispersion==\nIn physics, '''dielectric dispersion''' is the dependence of the permittivity of a dielectric material on the frequency of an applied electric field. Because there is a lag between changes in polarization and changes in the electric field, the permittivity of the dielectric is a complicated function of frequency of the electric field. Dielectric dispersion is very important for the applications of dielectric materials and for the analysis of polarization systems.\n\nThis is one instance of a general phenomenon known as [[material dispersion]]: a frequency-dependent response of a medium for wave propagation.\n\nWhen the frequency becomes higher:\n# dipolar polarization can no longer follow the oscillations of the electric field in the [[microwave]] region around 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]];\n# ionic polarization and molecular distortion polarization can no longer track the electric field past the [[infrared]] or far-infrared region around 10<sup>13</sup> Hz, ;\n# electronic polarization loses its response in the ultraviolet region around 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Hz.\n\nIn the frequency region above ultraviolet, permittivity approaches the constant ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> in every substance, where ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is the permittivity of the free space. Because permittivity indicates the strength of the relation between an electric field and polarization, if a polarization process loses its response, permittivity decreases.\n\n==Dielectric relaxation==\n'''Dielectric relaxation''' is the momentary delay (or lag) in the [[dielectric constant]] of a material. This is usually caused by the delay in molecular polarization with respect to a changing electric field in a dielectric medium (e.g., inside capacitors or between two large [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] surfaces). Dielectric relaxation in changing electric fields could be considered analogous to [[hysteresis]] in changing [[magnetic field]]s (e.g., in [[inductor]] or [[transformer]] [[Magnetic_core#Core_loss|cores]]). Relaxation in general is a delay or lag in the response of a [[linear system]], and therefore dielectric relaxation is measured relative to the expected linear steady state (equilibrium) dielectric values. The time lag between electrical field and polarization implies an irreversible degradation of [[Gibbs free energy]].\n\nIn [[physics]], '''dielectric relaxation''' refers to the relaxation response of a dielectric medium to an external, oscillating electric field. This relaxation is often described in terms of permittivity as a function of [[frequency]], which can, for ideal systems, be described by the Debye equation. On the other hand, the distortion related to ionic and electronic polarization shows behavior of the [[resonance]] or [[oscillator]] type. The character of the distortion process depends on the structure, composition, and surroundings of the sample.\n\n===Debye relaxation===\n'''Debye relaxation''' is the dielectric relaxation response of an ideal, noninteracting population of dipoles to an alternating external electric field. It is usually expressed in the complex permittivity ''\u03b5'' of a medium as a function of the field's [[frequency]] ''\u03c9'':\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon}{1 - i\\omega\\tau},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b5<sub>\u221e</sub>'' is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, {{nowrap|\u0394''\u03b5'' {{=}} ''\u03b5<sub>s</sub>'' \u2212 ''\u03b5<sub>\u221e</sub>''}} where ''\u03b5<sub>s</sub>'' is the static, low frequency permittivity, and ''\u03c4'' is the characteristic [[relaxation time]] of the medium. Separating into the real part <math>\\varepsilon'</math> and the imaginary part <math>\\varepsilon''</math> of the complex dielectric permittivity yields:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dielectric Phenomena in Solids|last=Kao|first=Kwan Chi|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-12-396561-5|location=London|pages=92\u201393|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\varepsilon' &= \\varepsilon_\\infty + \\frac{\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2} \\\\[3pt]\n  \\varepsilon'' &= \\frac{(\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty)\\omega\\tau}{1+\\omega^2\\tau^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe dielectric loss is also represented by:\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\delta) = \\frac{\\varepsilon''}{\\varepsilon'} = \\frac{\\left(\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty\\right)\\omega\\tau}{\\varepsilon_s + \\varepsilon_\\infty \\omega^2 \\tau^2}</math>\n\nThis relaxation model was introduced by and named after the physicist [[Peter Debye]] (1913).<ref>Debye, P. (1913), Ver. Deut. Phys. Gesell. 15, 777; reprinted 1954 in collected papers of Peter J.W. Debye. Interscience, New York</ref> It is characteristic for dynamic polarization with only one relaxation time.\n\n===Variants of the Debye equation===\n;[[Cole\u2013Cole equation]]: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows symmetric broadening.\n;[[Cole\u2013Davidson equation]]: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows asymmetric broadening.\n;[[Havriliak\u2013Negami relaxation]]: This equation considers both symmetric and asymmetric broadening.\n;[[Kohlrausch\u2013Williams\u2013Watts function]]: Fourier transform of [[stretched exponential function]].\n;[[Curie\u2013von Schweidler law]]: This shows the response of dielectrics to an applied DC field to behave according to a power law, which can be expressed as an integral over weighted exponential functions..\n\n==Paraelectricity==\n\n{{See also|Ferroelectricity}}\n\nParaelectricity is the ability of many materials (specifically [[ceramic]]s) to become polarized under an applied [[electric field]]. Unlike [[ferroelectricity]], this can happen even if there is no permanent [[electric dipole]] that exists in the material, and removal of the fields results in the [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]] in the material returning to zero.<ref>Chiang, Y. et al. (1997) ''Physical Ceramics'', [[John Wiley & Sons]], New York</ref> The mechanisms that cause '''paraelectric''' behaviour are the distortion of individual [[ions]] (displacement of the electron cloud from the nucleus) and polarization of molecules or combinations of ions or defects.\n\nParaelectricity can occur in [[crystal]] phases where electric dipoles are unaligned and thus have the potential to align in an external [[electric field]] and weaken it.\n\nAn example of a paraelectric material of high dielectric constant is [[strontium titanate]].\n\nThe [[lithium niobate|LiNbO<SUB>3</SUB>]] crystal is [[ferroelectric]] below 1430 [[Kelvin|K]], and above this temperature it transforms into a disordered paraelectric phase. Similarly, other [[perovskite]]s also exhibit paraelectricity at high temperatures.\n\nParaelectricity has been explored as a possible refrigeration mechanism; polarizing a paraelectric by applying an electric field under [[adiabatic|adiabatic process]] conditions raises the temperature, while removing the field lowers the temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuhn | first1 = U. | last2 = L\u00fcty | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1016/0038-1098(65)90060-8 | title = Paraelectric heating and cooling with OH\u2014dipoles in alkali halides | journal = Solid State Communications | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 31 | year = 1965 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1965SSCom...3...31K }}</ref> A heat pump that operates by polarizing the paraelectric, allowing it to return to ambient temperature (by dissipating the extra heat), bringing it into contact with the object to be cooled, and finally depolarizing it, would result in refrigeration.\n\n==Tunability==\n\n''Tunable dielectrics'' are insulators whose ability to store electrical charge changes when a voltage is applied.<ref name=k>{{cite journal|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/self-correcting-crystal-may-lead-to-the-next-generation-of-advanced-communications-2 |title=Self-correcting crystal may lead to the next generation of advanced communications |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7472 |pages=532\u20136 |doi=10.1038/nature12582|pmid=24132232 |year=2013 |last1=Lee |first1=Che-Hui |last2=Orloff |first2=Nathan D. |last3=Birol |first3=Turan |last4=Zhu |first4=Ye |last5=Goian |first5=Veronica |last6=Rocas |first6=Eduard |last7=Haislmaier |first7=Ryan |last8=Vlahos |first8=Eftihia |last9=Mundy |first9=Julia A. |last10=Kourkoutis |first10=Lena F. |last11=Nie |first11=Yuefeng |last12=Biegalski |first12=Michael D. |last13=Zhang |first13=Jingshu |last14=Bernhagen |first14=Margitta |last15=Benedek |first15=Nicole A. |last16=Kim |first16=Yongsam |last17=Brock |first17=Joel D. |last18=Uecker |first18=Reinhard |last19=Xi |first19=X.

A dielectric (orange) reduces the field and increases the capacitance.]]\n\nCommercially manufactured capacitors typically use a [[solid]] dielectric material with high permittivity as the intervening medium between the stored positive and negative charges. This material is often referred to in technical contexts as the ''capacitor dielectric''.<ref>M\u00fcssig, Hans-Joachim.

More significantly, however, a high permittivity allows a greater stored charge at a given voltage. This can be seen by treating the case of a linear dielectric with permittivity ''\u03b5'' and thickness ''d'' between two conducting plates with uniform charge density ''\u03c3<sub>\u03b5</sub>''. In this case the charge density is given by\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}=\\varepsilon\\frac{V}{d}</math>\n\nand the [[capacitance]] per unit area by\n\n:<math>c=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}}{V}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{d}</math>\n\nFrom this, it can easily be seen that a larger ''\u03b5'' leads to greater charge stored and thus greater capacitance.\n\nDielectric materials used for capacitors are also chosen such that they are resistant to [[ionization]]. This allows the capacitor to operate at higher voltages before the insulating dielectric ionizes and begins to allow undesirable current.\n\n===Dielectric resonator===\n{{Main|Dielectric resonator}}\n\nA ''dielectric resonator oscillator'' (DRO) is an electronic component that exhibits [[resonance]] of the polarization response for a narrow range of frequencies, generally in the microwave band.

Some examples include [[porcelain]], [[glass]], and most [[plastic]]s. Air, [[nitrogen]] and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] are the three most commonly used [[gaseous dielectric]]s.\n*[[Industrial coating]]s such as [[Parylene]] provide a dielectric barrier between the substrate and its environment.\n*[[Mineral oil]] is used extensively inside electrical [[transformer]]s as a fluid dielectric and to assist in cooling. Dielectric fluids with higher dielectric constants, such as electrical grade [[castor oil]], are often used in [[high voltage]] capacitors to help prevent [[corona discharge]] and increase capacitance.\n*Because dielectrics resist the flow of electricity, the surface of a dielectric may retain ''stranded'' excess electrical charges. This may occur accidentally when the dielectric is rubbed (the [[triboelectric effect]]). This can be useful, as in a [[Van de Graaff generator]] or [[electrophorus]], or it can be potentially destructive as in the case of [[electrostatic discharge]].\n*Specially processed dielectrics, called [[electret]]s (which should not be confused with [[ferroelectric]]s), may retain excess internal charge or \"frozen in\" polarization. Electrets have a semipermanent electric field, and are the electrostatic equivalent to magnets. Electrets have numerous practical applications in the home and industry.\n*Some dielectrics can generate a potential difference when subjected to mechanical [[Stress (physics)|stress]], or (equivalently) change physical shape if an external voltage is applied across the material. This property is called [[piezoelectricity]]. Piezoelectric materials are another class of very useful dielectrics.\n*Some ionic [[crystal]]s and [[polymer]] dielectrics exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment, which can be reversed by an externally applied electric field. This behavior is called the [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric effect]]. These materials are analogous to the way [[ferromagnetic materials]] behave within an externally applied magnetic field. Ferroelectric materials often have very high dielectric constants, making them quite useful for capacitors.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Permittivity#Classification of materials|Classification of materials based on permittivity]]\n*[[Paramagnetism]]\n*[[Clausius-Mossotti relation]]\n*[[Dielectric absorption]]\n*[[Dielectric losses]]\n*[[Dielectric strength]]\n*[[Dielectric spectroscopy]]\n*[[EIA Class 1 dielectric]]\n*[[EIA Class 2 dielectric]]\n*[[High-k dielectric]]\n*[[Low-k dielectric]]\n*[[leakage (electronics)|leakage]]\n*[[Linear response function]]\n*[[Metamaterial]]\n*[[RC delay]]\n*[[Rotational Brownian motion]]\n*[[Paschen's law]] \u2013 variation of Dielectric strength of gas related to pressure\n*[[Separator (electricity)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Jackson\n  | first =John David\n  | authorlink =John David Jackson (physicist)\n  | title =Classical Electrodynamics\n  | publisher =[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n  | edition =3 rd\n  | date =August 10, 1998\n  | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=U3LBQgAACAAJ }}\n  | isbn =978-0-471-30932-1 }} 808 or 832 pages.\n\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Scaife\n  | first =Brendan\n  | authorlink =Brendan Scaife\n  | title =Principles of Dielectrics (Monographs on the Physics & Chemistry of Materials)\n  | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]\n  | edition =2 nd\n  | date =September 3, 1998\n  | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=9GBP9uBwpScC }}\n  | isbn =978-0198565574 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/0sn/ch11/ch11.html Electromagnetism] \u2013 A chapter from an online textbook\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116093447/http://wiki.4hv.org/index.php/Dielectric_Sphere_in_Electric_Field Dielectric Sphere in an Electric Field]\n*[http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/dielectrics/index.php DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package \"Dielectric Materials\"]\n*{{Wikisource-inline|list=\n**{{Cite Americana|short=1|wstitle=Dielectric|noicon=x}}\n**{{Cite EB1911|short=1|wstitle=Dielectric|noicon=x}}\n}}\n\n{{Polarization states}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dielectrics| ]]\n[[Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Electrically poorly conducting or non-conducting, non-metallic substance of which charge carriers are generally not free to move}}\n{{distinguish|Dielectric constant|Dialectic}}\n\n[[File:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|A polarized dielectric material]]\n\nA '''dielectric''' (or '''dielectric material''') is an [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]] that can be polarized by an applied [[electric field]]. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through  the material as they do in an [[electrical conductor]] but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing '''dielectric polarization'''. Because of dielectric [[Polarization density|polarization]], positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field (for example, if the field is moving in the positive x-axis, the negative charges will shift in the negative x-axis). This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself.<ref name=britannica1/> If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarized, but also reorient so that their [[Symmetry axis|symmetry axes]] align to the field.<ref name=britannica1/>\n\nThe study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials.<ref>[[Arthur R. von Hippel]], in his seminal work, ''Dielectric Materials and Applications'', stated: \"''Dielectrics''... are not a narrow class of so-called insulators, but the broad expanse of ''nonmetals'' considered from the standpoint of their interaction with electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields.

This, in turn, determines the electric [[permittivity]] of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of [[capacitor]]s to the [[speed of light]].\n\nIt is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a [[tensor]]) relating an electric field '''E''' to the induced dielectric [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] '''P''' such that\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P} = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e \\mathbf{E},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]].\n\nThe susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' by\n\n:<math>\\chi_e\\ = \\varepsilon_r - 1.</math>\n\nSo in the case of a vacuum,\n\n:<math>\\chi_e\\ = 0.</math>\n\nThe [[electric displacement]] '''D''' is related to the polarization density '''P''' by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\left(1 + \\chi_e\\right) \\mathbf{E} \\ = \\ \n  \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\mathbf{E}.\n</math>\n\n===Dispersion and causality===\nIn general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field. The more general formulation as a function of time is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\chi_e\\left(t - t'\\right) \\mathbf{E}\\left(t'\\right)\\, dt'.</math>\n\nThat is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t''). The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|\u0394''t'' < 0}}. An instantaneous response corresponds to [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>\u03b4''(\u0394''t'')}}.\n\nIt is more convenient in a linear system to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Due to the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}(\\omega).</math>\n\nThe susceptibility (or equivalently the permittivity) is frequency dependent. The change of susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|\u0394''t'' < 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation|Kramers\u2013Kronig constraints]] on the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>''(''\u03c9'').\n\n==Dielectric polarization==<!--Dielectric polarization redirects here-->\n\n===Basic atomic model===\n\n[[Image:dielectric model.svg|right|thumb|400px|Electric field interaction with an atom under the classical dielectric model.]]\n\nIn the classical approach to the dielectric model, a material is made up of atoms. Each atom consists of a cloud of negative charge (electrons) bound to and surrounding a positive point charge at its centre. In the presence of an electric field the charge cloud is distorted, as shown in the top right of the figure.\n\nThis can be reduced to a simple [[dipole]] using the [[superposition principle]]. A dipole is characterized by its [[electrical dipole moment|dipole moment]], a vector quantity shown in the figure as the blue arrow labeled ''M''. It is the relationship between the electric field and the dipole moment that gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric. (Note that the dipole moment points in the same direction as the electric field in the figure. This isn't always the case, and is a major simplification, but is true for many materials.)\n\nWhen the electric field is removed the atom returns to its original state. The time required to do so is the so-called [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] time; an exponential decay.\n\nThis is the essence of the model in physics. The behavior of the dielectric now depends on the situation. The more complicated the situation, the richer the model must be to accurately describe the behavior. Important questions are:\n*Is the electric field constant or does it vary with time? At what rate?\n*Does the response depend on the direction of the applied field ([[isotropy]] of the material)?\n*Is the response the same everywhere ([[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the material)?\n*Do any boundaries or interfaces have to be taken into account?\n*Is the response [[Linear system|linear]] with respect to the field, or are there [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]]?\n\nThe relationship between the electric field '''E''' and the dipole moment '''M''' gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric, which, for a given material, can be characterized by the function '''F''' defined by the equation:\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{E})</math>.\n\nWhen both the type of electric field and the type of material have been defined, one then chooses the simplest function ''F'' that correctly predicts the phenomena of interest. Examples of phenomena that can be so modeled include:\n\n*[[Refractive index]]\n*[[Group velocity dispersion]]\n*[[Birefringence]]\n*[[Self-focusing]]\n*[[Harmonic generation]]\n\n===Dipolar polarization=== <!--Dipolar polarization redirects here-->\nDipolar polarization is a polarization that is either inherent to [[polar molecule]]s ('''orientation polarization'''), or can be induced in any molecule in which the asymmetric distortion of the nuclei is possible ('''distortion polarization'''). Orientation polarization results from a permanent dipole, e.g., that arising from the 104.45\u00b0 angle between the asymmetric bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the water molecule, which retains polarization in the absence of an external electric field. The assembly of these dipoles forms a macroscopic polarization.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied, the distance between charges within each permanent dipole, which is related to [[chemical bond]]ing, remains constant in orientation polarization; however, the direction of polarization itself rotates. This rotation occurs on a timescale that depends on the [[torque]] and surrounding local [[viscosity]] of the molecules. Because the rotation is not instantaneous, dipolar polarizations lose the response to electric fields at the highest frequencies. A molecule rotates about 1 radian per picosecond in a fluid, thus this loss occurs at about 10<sup>11</sup> Hz (in the microwave region). The delay of the response to the change of the electric field causes [[friction]] and heat.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied at [[infrared]] frequencies or less, the molecules are bent and stretched by the field and the molecular dipole moment changes. The molecular vibration frequency is roughly the inverse of the time it takes for the molecules to bend, and this '''distortion polarization''' disappears above the infrared.\n\n===Ionic polarization=== <!--Ionic polarization redirects here-->\nIonic polarization is polarization caused by relative displacements between positive and negative [[ion]]s in [[ionic crystal]]s (for example, [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]).\n\nIf a crystal or molecule consists of atoms of more than one kind, the distribution of charges around an atom in the crystal or molecule leans to positive or negative. As a result, when lattice vibrations or molecular vibrations induce relative displacements of the atoms, the centers of positive and negative charges are also displaced. The locations of these centers are affected by the symmetry of the displacements. When the centers don't correspond, polarization arises in molecules or crystals. This polarization is called '''ionic polarization'''.\n\nIonic polarization causes the [[ferroelectric effect]] as well as [[dipolar polarization]]. The ferroelectric transition, which is caused by the lining up of the orientations of permanent dipoles along a particular direction, is called an '''order-disorder phase transition'''. The transition caused by ionic polarizations in crystals is called a '''displacive phase transition'''.\n\n====In cells====\nIonic polarization enables the production of energy-rich compounds in cells (the [[proton pump]] in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]) and, at the [[plasma membrane]], the establishment of the [[resting potential]], energetically unfavourable transport of ions, and cell-to-cell communication (the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]]).\n\nAll cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized \u2013 in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's [[plasma membrane]], known as the [[membrane potential]]. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between [[Ion transporter|ion transporters]] and [[ion channels]].\n\nIn neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the [[dendrite]]s, [[axon]], and [[soma (biology)|cell body]] different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not.\n\n==Dielectric dispersion==\nIn physics, '''dielectric dispersion''' is the dependence of the permittivity of a dielectric material on the frequency of an applied electric field. Because there is a lag between changes in polarization and changes in the electric field, the permittivity of the dielectric is a complicated function of frequency of the electric field. Dielectric dispersion is very important for the applications of dielectric materials and for the analysis of polarization systems.\n\nThis is one instance of a general phenomenon known as [[material dispersion]]: a frequency-dependent response of a medium for wave propagation.\n\nWhen the frequency becomes higher:\n# dipolar polarization can no longer follow the oscillations of the electric field in the [[microwave]] region around 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]];\n# ionic polarization and molecular distortion polarization can no longer track the electric field past the [[infrared]] or far-infrared region around 10<sup>13</sup> Hz, ;\n# electronic polarization loses its response in the ultraviolet region around 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Hz.\n\nIn the frequency region above ultraviolet, permittivity approaches the constant ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> in every substance, where ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is the permittivity of the free space. Because permittivity indicates the strength of the relation between an electric field and polarization, if a polarization process loses its response, permittivity decreases.\n\n==Dielectric relaxation==\n'''Dielectric relaxation''' is the momentary delay (or lag) in the [[dielectric constant]] of a material. This is usually caused by the delay in molecular polarization with respect to a changing electric field in a dielectric medium (e.g., inside capacitors or between two large [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] surfaces). Dielectric relaxation in changing electric fields could be considered analogous to [[hysteresis]] in changing [[magnetic field]]s (e.g., in [[inductor]] or [[transformer]] [[Magnetic_core#Core_loss|cores]]). Relaxation in general is a delay or lag in the response of a [[linear system]], and therefore dielectric relaxation is measured relative to the expected linear steady state (equilibrium) dielectric values. The time lag between electrical field and polarization implies an irreversible degradation of [[Gibbs free energy]].\n\nIn [[physics]], '''dielectric relaxation''' refers to the relaxation response of a dielectric medium to an external, oscillating electric field. This relaxation is often described in terms of permittivity as a function of [[frequency]], which can, for ideal systems, be described by the Debye equation. On the other hand, the distortion related to ionic and electronic polarization shows behavior of the [[resonance]] or [[oscillator]] type. The character of the distortion process depends on the structure, composition, and surroundings of the sample.\n\n===Debye relaxation===\n'''Debye relaxation''' is the dielectric relaxation response of an ideal, noninteracting population of dipoles to an alternating external electric field. It is usually expressed in the complex permittivity ''\u03b5'' of a medium as a function of the field's [[frequency]] ''\u03c9'':\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon}{1 - i\\omega\\tau},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b5<sub>\u221e</sub>'' is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, {{nowrap|\u0394''\u03b5'' {{=}} ''\u03b5<sub>s</sub>'' \u2212 ''\u03b5<sub>\u221e</sub>''}} where ''\u03b5<sub>s</sub>'' is the static, low frequency permittivity, and ''\u03c4'' is the characteristic [[relaxation time]] of the medium. Separating into the real part <math>\\varepsilon'</math> and the imaginary part <math>\\varepsilon''</math> of the complex dielectric permittivity yields:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dielectric Phenomena in Solids|last=Kao|first=Kwan Chi|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-12-396561-5|location=London|pages=92\u201393|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\varepsilon' &= \\varepsilon_\\infty + \\frac{\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2} \\\\[3pt]\n  \\varepsilon'' &= \\frac{(\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty)\\omega\\tau}{1+\\omega^2\\tau^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe dielectric loss is also represented by:\n\n:<math>\\tan(\\delta) = \\frac{\\varepsilon''}{\\varepsilon'} = \\frac{\\left(\\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty\\right)\\omega\\tau}{\\varepsilon_s + \\varepsilon_\\infty \\omega^2 \\tau^2}</math>\n\nThis relaxation model was introduced by and named after the physicist [[Peter Debye]] (1913).<ref>Debye, P.

Unlike [[ferroelectricity]], this can happen even if there is no permanent [[electric dipole]] that exists in the material, and removal of the fields results in the [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]] in the material returning to zero.<ref>Chiang, Y. et al. (1997) ''Physical Ceramics'', [[John Wiley & Sons]], New York</ref> The mechanisms that cause '''paraelectric''' behaviour are the distortion of individual [[ions]] (displacement of the electron cloud from the nucleus) and polarization of molecules or combinations of ions or defects.\n\nParaelectricity can occur in [[crystal]] phases where electric dipoles are unaligned and thus have the potential to align in an external [[electric field]] and weaken it.\n\nAn example of a paraelectric material of high dielectric constant is [[strontium titanate]].\n\nThe [[lithium niobate|LiNbO<SUB>3</SUB>]] crystal is [[ferroelectric]] below 1430 [[Kelvin|K]], and above this temperature it transforms into a disordered paraelectric phase. Similarly, other [[perovskite]]s also exhibit paraelectricity at high temperatures.\n\nParaelectricity has been explored as a possible refrigeration mechanism; polarizing a paraelectric by applying an electric field under [[adiabatic|adiabatic process]] conditions raises the temperature, while removing the field lowers the temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuhn | first1 = U. | last2 = L\u00fcty | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1016/0038-1098(65)90060-8 | title = Paraelectric heating and cooling with OH\u2014dipoles in alkali halides | journal = Solid State Communications | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 31 | year = 1965 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1965SSCom...3...31K }}</ref> A heat pump that operates by polarizing the paraelectric, allowing it to return to ambient temperature (by dissipating the extra heat), bringing it into contact with the object to be cooled, and finally depolarizing it, would result in refrigeration.\n\n==Tunability==\n\n''Tunable dielectrics'' are insulators whose ability to store electrical charge changes when a voltage is applied.<ref name=k>{{cite journal|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/self-correcting-crystal-may-lead-to-the-next-generation-of-advanced-communications-2 |title=Self-correcting crystal may lead to the next generation of advanced communications |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7472 |pages=532\u20136 |doi=10.1038/nature12582|pmid=24132232 |year=2013 |last1=Lee |first1=Che-Hui |last2=Orloff |first2=Nathan D. |last3=Birol |first3=Turan |last4=Zhu |first4=Ye |last5=Goian |first5=Veronica |last6=Rocas |first6=Eduard |last7=Haislmaier |first7=Ryan |last8=Vlahos |first8=Eftihia |last9=Mundy |first9=Julia A. |last10=Kourkoutis |first10=Lena F. |last11=Nie |first11=Yuefeng |last12=Biegalski |first12=Michael D. |last13=Zhang |first13=Jingshu |last14=Bernhagen |first14=Margitta |last15=Benedek |first15=Nicole A. |last16=Kim |first16=Yongsam |last17=Brock |first17=Joel D. |last18=Uecker |first18=Reinhard |last19=Xi |first19=X.

The material was created via [[molecular beam epitaxy]]. The two have mismatched crystal spacing that produces strain within the strontium titanate layer that makes it less stable and tunable.<ref name=k/>\n\nSystems such as {{chem|Ba|1\u2212x|Sr|x|Ti|O|3}} have a paraelectric\u2013ferroelectric transition just below ambient temperature, providing high tunability. Such films suffer significant losses arising from defects.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Capacitors===\n\n{{Main|Capacitor}}\n\n[[Image:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|upright|Charge separation in a parallel-plate capacitor causes an internal electric field. A dielectric (orange) reduces the field and increases the capacitance.]]\n\nCommercially manufactured capacitors typically use a [[solid]] dielectric material with high permittivity as the intervening medium between the stored positive and negative charges. This material is often referred to in technical contexts as the ''capacitor dielectric''.<ref>M\u00fcssig, Hans-Joachim. ''Semiconductor capacitor with praseodymium oxide as dielectric'', {{US Patent|7113388}} published 2003-11-06, issued 2004-10-18, assigned to IHP GmbH- Innovations for High Performance Microelectronics/Institute Fur Innovative Mikroelektronik</ref>\n\nThe most obvious advantage to using such a dielectric material is that it prevents the conducting plates, on which the charges are stored, from coming into direct electrical contact. More significantly, however, a high permittivity allows a greater stored charge at a given voltage. This can be seen by treating the case of a linear dielectric with permittivity ''\u03b5'' and thickness ''d'' between two conducting plates with uniform charge density ''\u03c3<sub>\u03b5</sub>''. In this case the charge density is given by\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}=\\varepsilon\\frac{V}{d}</math>\n\nand the [[capacitance]] per unit area by\n\n:<math>c=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}}{V}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{d}</math>\n\nFrom this, it can easily be seen that a larger ''\u03b5'' leads to greater charge stored and thus greater capacitance.\n\nDielectric materials used for capacitors are also chosen such that they are resistant to [[ionization]]. This allows the capacitor to operate at higher voltages before the insulating dielectric ionizes and begins to allow undesirable current.\n\n===Dielectric resonator===\n{{Main|Dielectric resonator}}\n\nA ''dielectric resonator oscillator'' (DRO) is an electronic component that exhibits [[resonance]] of the polarization response for a narrow range of frequencies, generally in the microwave band. It consists of a \"puck\" of ceramic that has a large dielectric constant and a low [[dissipation factor]]. Such resonators are often used to provide a frequency reference in an oscillator circuit. An unshielded dielectric resonator can be used as a [[Dielectric Resonator Antenna|dielectric resonator antenna]] (DRA).\n\n=== BST thin films ===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, the [[Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) conducted research on thin film technology.

Some examples include [[porcelain]], [[glass]], and most [[plastic]]s. Air, [[nitrogen]] and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] are the three most commonly used [[gaseous dielectric]]s.\n*[[Industrial coating]]s such as [[Parylene]] provide a dielectric barrier between the substrate and its environment.\n*[[Mineral oil]] is used extensively inside electrical [[transformer]]s as a fluid dielectric and to assist in cooling. Dielectric fluids with higher dielectric constants, such as electrical grade [[castor oil]], are often used in [[high voltage]] capacitors to help prevent [[corona discharge]] and increase capacitance.\n*Because dielectrics resist the flow of electricity, the surface of a dielectric may retain ''stranded'' excess electrical charges. This may occur accidentally when the dielectric is rubbed (the [[triboelectric effect]]). This can be useful, as in a [[Van de Graaff generator]] or [[electrophorus]], or it can be potentially destructive as in the case of [[electrostatic discharge]].\n*Specially processed dielectrics, called [[electret]]s (which should not be confused with [[ferroelectric]]s), may retain excess internal charge or \"frozen in\" polarization. Electrets have a semipermanent electric field, and are the electrostatic equivalent to magnets. Electrets have numerous practical applications in the home and industry.\n*Some dielectrics can generate a potential difference when subjected to mechanical [[Stress (physics)|stress]], or (equivalently) change physical shape if an external voltage is applied across the material. This property is called [[piezoelectricity]]. Piezoelectric materials are another class of very useful dielectrics.\n*Some ionic [[crystal]]s and [[polymer]] dielectrics exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment, which can be reversed by an externally applied electric field. This behavior is called the [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric effect]]. These materials are analogous to the way [[ferromagnetic materials]] behave within an externally applied magnetic field. Ferroelectric materials often have very high dielectric constants, making them quite useful for capacitors.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Permittivity#Classification of materials|Classification of materials based on permittivity]]\n*[[Paramagnetism]]\n*[[Clausius-Mossotti relation]]\n*[[Dielectric absorption]]\n*[[Dielectric losses]]\n*[[Dielectric strength]]\n*[[Dielectric spectroscopy]]\n*[[EIA Class 1 dielectric]]\n*[[EIA Class 2 dielectric]]\n*[[High-k dielectric]]\n*[[Low-k dielectric]]\n*[[leakage (electronics)|leakage]]\n*[[Linear response function]]\n*[[Metamaterial]]\n*[[RC delay]]\n*[[Rotational Brownian motion]]\n*[[Paschen's law]] \u2013 variation of Dielectric strength of gas related to pressure\n*[[Separator (electricity)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Jackson\n  | first =John David\n  | authorlink =John David Jackson (physicist)\n  | title =Classical Electrodynamics\n  | publisher =[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n  | edition =3 rd\n  | date =August 10, 1998\n  | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=U3LBQgAACAAJ }}\n  | isbn =978-0-471-30932-1 }} 808 or 832 pages.\n\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Scaife\n  | first =Brendan\n  | authorlink =Brendan Scaife\n  | title =Principles of Dielectrics (Monographs on the Physics & Chemistry of Materials)\n  | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]\n  | edition =2 nd\n  | date =September 3, 1998\n  | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=9GBP9uBwpScC }}\n  | isbn =978-0198565574 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/0sn/ch11/ch11.html Electromagnetism] \u2013 A chapter from an online textbook\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116093447/http://wiki.4hv.org/index.php/Dielectric_Sphere_in_Electric_Field Dielectric Sphere in an Electric Field]\n*[http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/dielectrics/index.php DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package \"Dielectric Materials\"]\n*{{Wikisource-inline|list=\n**{{Cite Americana|short=1|wstitle=Dielectric|noicon=x}}\n**{{Cite EB1911|short=1|wstitle=Dielectric|noicon=x}}\n}}\n\n{{Polarization states}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dielectrics| ]]\n[[Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4072:40d:aaa:f0a7:7640:ac88:f9fa", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTerminology)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric"}
{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W.

However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saron |first1=Mose |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon |date=1986 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789652640147 |page=266}}</ref> He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines. [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived by others as lustful.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ruby Lal|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8NJ41GiXvsC&pg=PA40|date=22 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85022-3|pages=40\u2013}}</ref>\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfnRef|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print. Company|pages=244\u2013}}</ref> The [[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V|Nawab of Bahawalpur]], according to a Pakistani journalist, kept 390 concubines. He only had sex with most of them once.{{sfn|Weiss|2004|p=190}} [[Maratha (caste)|Marathas]] captured during their wars with the Mughals had been given to the soldiers of the Mughal Army from the Baloch [[Bugti]] tribe. The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved.

Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=53}}</ref> The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur, Pakistan|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives are used sexually. Their Muslim captors state that Islamic law allows them. In [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Nesrine Badawi|title=Islamic Jurisprudence on the Regulation of Armed Conflict: Text and Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MC0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|date=1 October 2019|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-41062-6| ref = {{sfnRef|Badawi|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam |publisher=Harvard University Press |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PeOeXlqzZ-cC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2010| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2010}}}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Seedat |first1=Fatima |title=Sexual economies of war and sexual technologies of the body: Militarised Muslim masculinity and the Islamist production of concubines for the caliphate |journal=Agenda |date=2016 |volume=30 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/10130950.2016.1275558| ref = {{sfnRef|Seedat|2016}}}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Islamic Jurisprudence According To The Four Sunni Schools Al Fiqh 'ala Al Madhahib Al Arba'ah|last=Al-jaziri|first=abd Al-rahman|last2=Roberts|first2=Nancy|publisher=Fons Vitae|year=2009|isbn=978-1887752978| ref = {{sfnRef|Nancy|2009}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Rizwi Faizer|title=The Life of Muhammad: Al-Waqidi's Kitab Al-Maghazi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZknAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA462|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-92114-8| ref = {{sfnRef|Faizer|2013}}}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Concubinage and Consent |journal=International Journal of Media Studies |date=2017 |volume=49  |doi=10.1017/S0020743816001203| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2017}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=John Ralph |title=Slaves and Slavery in Africa: Volume One: Islam and the Ideology of Enslavement |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317792130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5y3AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| ref = {{sfnRef|Willis|2014}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=McMahon |first1=Elisabeth |title=Slavery and Emancipation in Islamic East Africa: From Honor to Respectability |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107328518 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cwhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq| ref = {{sfnRef|McMahon|2013}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}}It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W.

However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saron |first1=Mose |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon |date=1986 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789652640147 |page=266}}</ref> He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines. [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived by others as lustful.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ruby Lal|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8NJ41GiXvsC&pg=PA40|date=22 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85022-3|pages=40\u2013}}</ref>\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfnRef|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

'The proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius') is a [[drawing]] made by the [[Italians|Italian]] polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in about 1490.<ref>The Secret Language of the Renaissance \u2013 Richard Stemp</ref> It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect [[Vitruvius]]. The drawing, which is in ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. It is kept in the ''Gabinetto dei disegni e delle stampe'' of the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leonardodavinci.stanford.edu/submissions/clabaugh/history/leonardo.html |title=The Vitruvian man |publisher=Leonardodavinci.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/leonardo-vitruvian-man.html |title=Da Vinci's Code |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref> The work was recently on display at the [[Louvre]]'s exhibit of Da Vinci's work, from 24 October  2019 to 24 February  2020 as part of an agreement between [[France]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aleteia.org/2019/12/01/louvre-exhibit-has-most-da-vinci-paintings-ever-assembled/ |title=Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Unexamined Life as a Painter |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=Aleteia |access-date=1 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/leonardo-da-vinci-louvre-museum-his-life-painter/602800/ |title=Louvre exhibit has most da Vinci paintings ever assembled |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=1 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe drawing represents ideal human [[body proportions]]. Its inscription in a square and a circle comes from a description by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''. Yet, as it has been demonstrated, Leonardo did not represent Vitruvius's proportions of the limbs but rather included those he found himself after measuring male models in Milan. While the drawing is named after Vitruvius, some scholars today question the appropriateness of such a title.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lugli|first=Emanuele|title=In cerca della perfezione: nuovi elementi per l&#39;Uomo vitruviano di Leonardo Da Vinci|url=https://www.academia.edu/40295085/In_cerca_della_perfezione_nuovi_elementi_per_lUomo_vitruviano_di_Leonardo_Da_Vinci|journal=Leonardo e Vitruvio: Oltre il cerchio e il quadrato, ed. by Francesca Borgo|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Subject and title==\nThis image demonstrates the blend of [[mathematics and art]] during the [[Renaissance]] and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of [[body proportions|proportion]].

The maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height of a man; from the breasts to the top of the head is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of the height of a man; the length of the hand is one-tenth of the height of a man; the root of the penis is at half the height of a man; the foot is one-seventh of the height of a man; from below the foot to below the knee is a quarter of the height of a man; from below the knee to the root of the penis is a quarter of the height of a man; the distances from below the chin to the nose and the eyebrows and the hairline are equal to the ears and to one-third of the face.}}\n\nThe points determining these proportions are marked with lines on the drawing. Below the drawing is a single line equal to a side of the square and divided into four cubits, of which the outer two are divided into six palms each, two of which have the mirror-text annotation \"palmi\"; the outermost two palms are divided into four fingers each, and are each annotated \"diti\".\n\n==Provenance==\nThe drawing was purchased from Gaudenzio de' Pagave by [[Giuseppe Bossi]],<ref name=bossi>Bossi, Giuseppe (1810)[https://archive.org/details/DelCenacolo4 ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci libri quattro''] (in Italian) Milano: Stamperia Reale p.208''ff''</ref> who described, discussed and illustrated it in his monograph on Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci'' (1810).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ursusbooks.com/item94345.html |title=Bibliographic reference |publisher=Ursusbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref> The following year he excerpted the section of his monograph concerned with the ''Vitruvian Man'' and published it as ''Delle opinioni di Leonardo da Vinci intorno alla simmetria de' Corpi Umani'' (1811), with a dedication to his friend [[Antonio Canova]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |title=Bibliographical notice, no. 319 |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107113208/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter Bossi's death in 1815 the ''Vitruvian Man'' was acquired in 1822, along with a number of his drawings, by the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy, and has remained there since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.venezia.net/12/09/2013/venice-accademia-gallery-leonardo-da-vinci-universal-man.html |title=LEONARDO DA VINCI.
