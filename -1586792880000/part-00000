His parents named him in honor of [[Francis of Assisi]] to whom they had a strong devotion.<ref name=CS/><ref name=CHRC/> As a child and adolescent he spent the greater part of his leisure time teaching Catholic doctrine to the poor children of Argigliano. He attended grammar school in [[Minucciano]] where his maternal uncle was Father Morelli, the assistant priest.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nOn 27 November 1660 he was admitted into the [[Carmelites]] at the [[convent]] of Cerignano in Fivizzano alongside his brother Tommaso. The two brothers returned home for several months before receiving the habit in [[Fivizzano]], and then deciding to go to [[Siena]] to the convent of San Nicola for the [[novitiate]] (their father escorted them); Paoli assumed the religious name of \"Angelo\" in honor of his father.<ref name=CS/><ref name=OC/><ref name=CHRC/> He made his vows on 18 December 1661 and then spent a prolonged period doing his philosophical and theological studies in both [[Pisa]] \u2013 at the convent of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa|Santa Maria del Carmine]] \u2013 and [[Florence]].\n\nHe was made a subdeacon on 20 December 1665 and was elevated into the [[diaconate]] on 19 December 1666. Paoli was [[ordained]] to the [[priesthood]] in Florence in 1667 and celebrated there his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on 7 January.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=OC/><ref name=SEB/> He was a sacristan and organist from his ordination until 1674 in Florence but was forced to return home for health reasons. On 15 August 1674 he distributed bread to the poor; it was deemed a miracle that the bread in the basket never depleted. He did not want to be recognized for this so he retreated into the mountains of Garfagana as a hermit, though each dawn he went to the shrine of San Pellegrino to celebrate Mass. In 1674 he was sent to Argigliano and Pistoia and then in 1675 was sent as the Master of Novices to Florence for eighteen months, then transferred to Carniola as a pastor from December 1676 to October 1677; ten months later in 1677 he was sent to Siena.<ref name=CHRC/> In 1680 he was sent to Montecatini and in 1682 was charged with teaching grammar to novices. Paoli was then appointed to a parish in [[Pisa]] for active service in 1682 but was later transferred to Cupoli, Monte Catino and [[Fivizzano]] a few months later as an organist and sacristan. He had a special devotion to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] and he caused wooden crosses to be erected on the hills around Fivizzano, to bring this devotion to the minds of others to reflect on the love the Redeemer had for mankind.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=OC/><ref name=SEB/> He often said: \"Whoever loves [[God]] must go to find Him among the poor.\"\n\nIn 1687 the Prior-General Paolo di Sant'Ignazio summoned him to [[Rome]] where he arrived on 12 March before being stationed at the church [[Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti]]; he would remain here for the rest of his life. Paoli arrived with nothing more than his [[breviary]] and a small white bag with a little bit of bread. He first passed through his hometown to bid farewell to his aging father and his siblings and then to Siena to bid farewell to his Carmelite friar brother Tommaso.<ref name=CHRC/> He spent the remainder of his life divided between the care of the sick and the poor in hospitals and then the office of Master of Novices which he held.<ref name=CS/> Paoli approached [[Pope Clement XI]] in 1708 and asked him for a restoration of the Coliseum since it should be their task to honor those killed for their faith there and to place wooden crosses there to honor them; Paoli also wanted to convince the pope to halt the pilfering of stone from the Coliseum. The pope was hesitant at first but allowed Paoli to gather volunteers to fix the place and had large wooden crosses placed there, which had been his dream.<ref name=CS/> Paoli managed to do this on [[Mount Testaccio]]. He also distinguished himself during two earthquakes at the start of 1703 in aiding the victims that were either displaced or injured. He fed the poor and provided them with blankets and clothes and while visiting hospitals gave them medicine and provided them comfort in their suffering.<ref name=OC/> In 1710 he opened a hospice for the poor of the area.\n\nPaoli received offers from both [[Pope Innocent XII]] and from Clement XI to be received into the cardinalate \u2013 once for 21 June 1700 \u2013 but the friar refused for he feared that he might not be able to spend as much time with the poor.<ref name=CS/> On the offers he said: \"It would have been hurtful to the poor whom I would not have been able to help\" due to the stringent demands of the cardinalate.<ref name=OC/> He also befriended Cardinal [[Giuseppe Maria Tomasi]] who was the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti.<ref name=CHRC/>\n\nPaoli was playing the organ on 14 January 1720 when a high fever struck him and confined him to his cell. He died on 20 January 1720 \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 at 6:45 am and his remains were interred in Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti; the pope himself ordered the inscription on the tomb titling Paoli as \"venerable\" and as the \"father of the poor\" like others had called him.<ref name=CHRC/> There were a great number of nobles and common folk in addition to cardinals and those in the episcopate who attended his funeral. Pope Clement XI was pained to learn of Paoli's death and in a letter to the order dubbed Paoli the \"father of the poor\".\n\n==Beatification==\nThe informative phase for the beatification cause opened in Rome in 1723 and concluded sometime later but also oversaw its business in Florence and in [[Pescia]]. The formal introduction to the cause came under [[Pope Clement XII]] on 14 July 1739 and Paoli became titled as a [[Servant of God]]; an apostolic process was later held from 1740 until 1754. [[Pope Pius VI]] confirmed that the late friar had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]] and named him as [[Venerable]] on 21 January 1781.\n\nThe three miracles that would have \u2013 in those times centuries back - led to his beatification never received approval so the cause seemed to stall despite even the order's 1908 effort at a General Chapter to revive it. But the impetus needed came in 1927 which the miraculous healing of a woman that was investigated on a diocesan level. But even that seemed to have stalled though was revitalized when the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated the diocesan process for the miracle on 9 March 2007. Medical experts approved this healing to be a miracle on 29 May 2008 as did theologians on 20 December 2008 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 26 May 2009. The process culminated on 3 July 2009 when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] signed a decree that recognized this 1927 healing was in fact a miracle attributed to Paoli's intercession and thus approved that the late Carmelite friar would be beatified.\n\nThe Secretariat of State announced the formal date for the beatification in a 9 January 2010 communique. Archbishop [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the beatification on 25 April 2010 in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Basilica di San Giovanni Laterano]]; the [[Cardinal Vicar of Rome]] [[Agostino Vallini]] was also in attendance.<ref name=CS/>\n\nThe current [[postulator]] for this cause is Dr. Giovanna Brizi.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{Catholic|wstitle=Ven.

He did not want to be recognized for this so he retreated into the mountains of Garfagana as a hermit, though each dawn he went to the shrine of San Pellegrino to celebrate Mass. In 1674 he was sent to Argigliano and Pistoia and then in 1675 was sent as the Master of Novices to Florence for eighteen months, then transferred to Carniola as a pastor from December 1676 to October 1677; ten months later in 1677 he was sent to Siena.<ref name=CHRC/> In 1680 he was sent to Montecatini and in 1682 was charged with teaching grammar to novices. Paoli was then appointed to a parish in [[Pisa]] for active service in 1682 but was later transferred to Cupoli, Monte Catino and [[Fivizzano]] a few months later as an organist and sacristan. He had a special devotion to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] and he caused wooden crosses to be erected on the hills around Fivizzano, to bring this devotion to the minds of others to reflect on the love the Redeemer had for mankind.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=OC/><ref name=SEB/> He often said: \"Whoever loves [[God]] must go to find Him among the poor.\"\n\nIn 1687 the Prior-General Paolo di Sant'Ignazio summoned him to [[Rome]] where he arrived on 12 March before being stationed at the church [[Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti]]; he would remain here for the rest of his life. Paoli arrived with nothing more than his [[breviary]] and a small white bag with a little bit of bread. He first passed through his hometown to bid farewell to his aging father and his siblings and then to Siena to bid farewell to his Carmelite friar brother Tommaso.<ref name=CHRC/> He spent the remainder of his life divided between the care of the sick and the poor in hospitals and then the office of Master of Novices which he held.<ref name=CS/> Paoli approached [[Pope Clement XI]] in 1708 and asked him for a restoration of the Coliseum since it should be their task to honor those killed for their faith there and to place wooden crosses there to honor them; Paoli also wanted to convince the pope to halt the pilfering of stone from the Coliseum. The pope was hesitant at first but allowed Paoli to gather volunteers to fix the place and had large wooden crosses placed there, which had been his dream.<ref name=CS/> Paoli managed to do this on [[Mount Testaccio]]. He also distinguished himself during two earthquakes at the start of 1703 in aiding the victims that were either displaced or injured. He fed the poor and provided them with blankets and clothes and while visiting hospitals gave them medicine and provided them comfort in their suffering.<ref name=OC/> In 1710 he opened a hospice for the poor of the area.\n\nPaoli received offers from both [[Pope Innocent XII]] and from Clement XI to be received into the cardinalate - once for 21 June 1700 - but the friar refused for he feared that he might not be able to spend as much time with the poor.<ref name=CS/> On the offers he said: \"It would have been hurtful to the poor whom I would not have been able to help\" due to the stringent demands of the cardinalate.<ref name=OC/> He also befriended the Cardinal [[Giuseppe Maria Tomasi]] who was the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti.<ref name=CHRC/>\n\nPaoli was using the organ on 14 January 1720 when a high fever struck him and confined him to his cell. Paoli later died on 20 January 1720 \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 at 6:45am and his remains were interred in Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti; the pope himself ordered the inscription on the tomb titling Paoli as \"venerable\" and as the \"father of the poor\" like others had called him.<ref name=CHRC/> There was a great number of nobles and common folk in addition to cardinals and those in the episcopate who attended his funeral. Pope Clement XI was pained to learn of Paoli's death and in a letter to the order dubbed Paoli the \"father of the poor\".\n\n==Beatification==\nThe informative phase for the beatification cause opened in Rome in 1723 and concluded sometime later but also oversaw its business in Florence and in [[Pescia]]. The formal introduction to the cause came under [[Pope Clement XII]] on 14 July 1739 and Paoli became titled as a [[Servant of God]]; an apostolic process was later held from 1740 until 1754. [[Pope Pius VI]] confirmed that the late friar had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]] and named him as [[Venerable]] on 21 January 1781.\n\nThe three miracles that would have \u2013 in those times centuries back - led to his beatification never received approval so the cause seemed to stall despite even the order's 1908 effort at a General Chapter to revive it. But the impetus needed came in 1927 which the miraculous healing of a woman that was investigated on a diocesan level. But even that seemed to have stalled though was revitalized when the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated the diocesan process for the miracle on 9 March 2007. Medical experts approved this healing to be a miracle on 29 May 2008 as did theologians on 20 December 2008 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 26 May 2009. The process culminated on 3 July 2009 when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] signed a decree that recognized this 1927 healing was in fact a miracle attributed to Paoli's intercession and thus approved that the late Carmelite friar would be beatified.\n\nThe Secretariat of State announced the formal date for the beatification in a 9 January 2010 communique. Archbishop [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the beatification on 25 April 2010 in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Basilica di San Giovanni Laterano]]; the [[Cardinal Vicar of Rome]] [[Agostino Vallini]] was also in attendance.<ref name=CS/>\n\nThe current [[postulator]] for this cause is Dr. Giovanna Brizi.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{Catholic|wstitle=Ven.

Demol''' (born 11 March 1966) is a Belgian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a current [[Manager (association football)|manager]].\n\nHe amassed [[Belgian First Division A]] totals of 120 games and 11 goals over the course of seven seasons, mainly with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] with which he won eight major titles combined. He also competed professionally in Italy, Portugal, France, Greece and Switzerland.\n\nDemol represented [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].

This treaty provided duty-free trade of sugar between the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States, and it generated massive disruptions in the sugar industry. Plantation growth and consolidation soon followed, with the number of plantations falling from 79 in 1875 to just 20 in 1883.{{sfnp | Jung | 2005 | p=12}} Prior to this disruption, the agencies played a much more limited role in Hawaiian industry. They served primarily to add liquidity to an agricultural industry with long growing periods (18-24 months) by both providing credit against future sails and providing transportation to foreign markets and equipment procurement. With the growth pressure imposed by the Reciprocity Treaty, however, plantations required capital infusions in order to expand their cultivation into more marginal lands, leading to increased reliance on the agencies for credit.{{sfnp | Jung | 2005 | pp=14-15}} With Hawaii's [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii#Annexation|annexed by the United States]], this change was locked in as sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s gained a new infusion of investment.  By eliminating tariffs imposed on sugarcane producers by the United States, planters had more money to spend on equipment, land and labor.  Increased capital resulted in increased production.  Five kingdom-era corporations benefited from annexation, becoming multimillion-dollar conglomerations that controlled 90% of the sugar business.<ref>{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/462 |title= German Sugar's Sticky Fingers |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |volume= 16 |author= Frederick Bernays Wiener |year= 1982  |pages= 15\u201347}}</ref>\nThe companies colluded to keep the prices on their goods and services high.

This treaty provided duty-free trade of sugar between the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States, and it generated massive disruptions in the sugar industry. Plantation growth and consolidation soon followed, with the number of plantations falling from 79 in 1875 to just 20 in 1883{{sfnp | Jung | 2005 | p=12}} Prior to this disruption, the agencies played a much more limited role in Hawaiian industry. They served primarily to add liquidity to an agricultural industry with long growing periods (18-24 months) by both providing credit against future sails and providing transportation to foreign markets and equipment procurement. With the growth pressure imposed by the Reciprocity Treaty, however, plantations required capital infusions in order to expand their cultivation into more marginal lands, leading to increased reliance on the agencies for credit.{{sfnp | Jung | 2005 | pp=14-15}} With Hawaii's [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii#Annexation|annexed by the United States]], this change was locked in as sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s gained a new infusion of investment.  By eliminating tariffs imposed on sugarcane producers by the United States, planters had more money to spend on equipment, land and labor.  Increased capital resulted in increased production.  Five kingdom-era corporations benefited from annexation, becoming multimillion-dollar conglomerations that controlled 90% of the sugar business.<ref>{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/462 |title= German Sugar's Sticky Fingers |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |volume= 16 |author= Frederick Bernays Wiener |year= 1982  |pages= 15\u201347}}</ref>\nThe companies colluded to keep the prices on their goods and services high.
