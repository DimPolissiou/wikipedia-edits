Absent: Kirsten Vangsness]]\n[[File:Criminal Minds at Paley.jpg|thumb|Cast and crew at a Paley Centre discussion of the show]]\n\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Gideon]] ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), senior supervisory special agent and former BAU unit chief (seasons 1\u20133)\n: Gideon is widely known as the BAU's best profiler. After a series of emotionally troubling cases and the murder of his friend Sarah by fugitive serial killer Frank Breitkopf ([[Keith Carradine]]), he begins to feel burned out. The last straw occurs when Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner is suspended for two weeks by the team's boss\u2014an action for which Jason feels responsible. He retreats to his cabin and leaves a letter for Dr. Spencer Reid, who he knows will be the one to look for him. When Spencer arrives at the cabin, he finds the letter and Jason's FBI credentials and firearm. Jason is last seen remarking to a Nevada diner waitress that he does not know where he is going or how he will know when he gets there, leaving the diner and driving off. In season 10, he is killed (off-screen) by a suspect he had tracked down from one of his first cases.\n* [[Aaron Hotchner]] ([[Thomas Gibson]]), Former BAU unit chief and senior supervisory special agent (seasons 1\u201312)\n: Hotch is a former [[prosecutor]] and was originally assigned to the FBI field office in Seattle. He is one of the most experienced agents in the BAU. He struggles to balance the demands of his job with his family life, but his wife, Haley Brooks ([[Meredith Monroe]]), divorces him in season 3. In the episode \"[[100 (Criminal Minds)|100]]\" (season 5), Haley is killed by [[fugitive]] [[serial killer]] George Foyet ([[C. Thomas Howell]]), also known as \"The Boston Reaper\", whom Aaron fights and beats to death. He also has a son named Jack (Cade Owens) and a brother named Sean. After Haley is murdered, he has custody of Jack, and Haley's sister, Jessica Brooks (Molly Baker), helps him take care of Jack. When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Aaron and technical analyst Penelope Garcia take over her job as communications liaison. Aaron dated a woman named Beth Clemmons ([[Bellamy Young]]), who first appeared in the episode \"The Bittersweet Science\" (season 7), before the couple separated after Clemmons accepted a job in Hong Kong. Following an on-set altercation, Thomas Gibson was removed from the main cast after season 12, episode 2, at which point Hotch went on temporary assignment. In a later episode, it's revealed Aaron and Jack went into witness protection after Jack was being stalked by Peter \"Mr. Scratch\" Lewis, a serial killer from a previous BAU case. Following Lewis's death in the 13th season premiere, Prentiss reveals that Aaron has opted not to return to the BAU, but instead to retire to be a full-time parent to Jack.\n* [[Elle Greenaway]] ([[Lola Glaudini]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|Supervisory Special Agent]] (seasons 1\u20132)\n:Greenaway is assigned to the FBI field office in [[Seattle]] and assigned to the BAU as an expert in sexual offense crimes. Elle suffers extreme emotional trauma after being shot by an [[Person of interest|unsub]] in the season 1 finale (\"The Fisher King (Part 1)\"). In the season 2 premiere (\"The Fisher King (Part 2)\"), Elle survives and returns to duty sooner than SSA Jason Gideon and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner would like. Several episodes later, while alone on stakeout of a suspected serial rapist, she murders the suspect by shooting him in cold blood and planting her gun on the unarmed victim. The local police deem it self-defense, but Jason and Aaron question her ability as a profiler after this. Elle resigns, turning in her badge and gun to Aaron, declaring that it is \"not an admission of guilt\".\n* [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]] ([[Shemar Moore]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special Agent]] (seasons 1\u201311; guest star seasons 12\u201313)\n: Morgan is a confident, assertive, and often hot-tempered character. He was raised by his mother, Fran, along with his two sisters, Sarah Morgan and Desiree Benita, after the death of his police officer father right in front of him. Derek was a troubled Chicago youth headed for [[juvenile delinquency]]. He was rescued and mentored by Carl Buford (Julius Tennon). Buford turned out to be a [[sexual predator]] who [[child molestation|molested]] Derek and other young boys; he was eventually arrested for murder. After developing an interest in football, Derek attended [[Northwestern University]] on a [[scholarship]]. After a football injury left him unable to play, he joined the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s [[bomb squad]] and later joined the FBI and the BAU. He has an emotionally intimate, but [[Platonic love|platonic]], relationship with technical analyst Penelope Garcia; the two have a unique shorthand and banter. In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), Derek shows utter hatred toward Ian Doyle (Timothy V. Murphy) for killing SSA Emily Prentiss, but when Emily returns alive, he has mixed feelings. In season 11, Derek is kidnapped and tortured by the father of Giuseppe Montolo, a hitman whom Derek put away and who later died while in custody. Derek escapes and when he learns his girlfriend Savannah is pregnant, he realizes that he doesn't want to put his family through something like this again. Derek leaves the BAU in the episode \"A Beautiful Disaster\" to care for his now-wife and newborn son.\n* [[Spencer Reid]] ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special agent]] (all seasons)\n: Reid is a genius who graduated from [[Las Vegas High School]] at age 12 and holds Ph.D.s in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[engineering]] as well as [[bachelor of arts]] degrees in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] and, as of season 4, is working on a B.A. in [[philosophy]]. It has been revealed that he has an [[IQ]] of 187, can read a dizzying 20,000 words per minute, and has an [[eidetic memory]]. Most of the members on the team are intimidated by his profound knowledge. He is habitually introduced as \"Dr. Spencer Reid\" in contrast to the other agents, who are introduced as \"supervisory special agent\". The purpose of this, as explained by Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner in the pilot episode (\"[[Extreme Aggressor (Criminal Minds Episode)|Extreme Aggressor]]\"), is to create a respectable first impression of Spencer, deflecting judgments about his age. His mother, Diana Reid ([[Jane Lynch]]), suffers from [[schizophrenia]] and is currently committed to a mental institution. In season 6 Reid starts suffering from cluster headaches and when doctors can't diagnose why, Reid thinks he might be in the early stages of schizophrenia himself. Reid takes SSA Emily Prentiss' death very hard and, when it was revealed the death was faked, was distrustful of both Prentiss and SSA Jennifer Jareau (who helped in the cover-up). During season 8, Reid becomes involved with a woman who was being stalked. In the episode \"Zugzwang\", her stalker ultimately kidnaps her and kills her, devastating Reid. In season 11 he is deeply affected by Derek Morgan's decision to leave the BAU but understands and supports his reasons. Initially Reid had a crush on JJ, even going as far as taking her on a date to a football game. As the series progresses, their relationship becomes more of the brother\u2013sister kind. Morgan and Reid maintained a brotherly relationship and Morgan refers to Reid as his \"little brother\" prior to his departure in season 11. Spencer is also the godfather of Jennifer's son, Henry, and Derek's son, Hank. In one episode Reid is himself arrested and finds himself in jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hWzuR-hKfE|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/news/1006659/9-burning-questions-we-have-about-criminal-minds-dr-reid/|title=9 Burning Questions We Have About Dr. Reid's Arrest - CBS.com|website=CBS|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau]] ([[A. J. Cook]]), former BAU communications liaison and current supervisory special agent (seasons 1\u20135, 7\u201315; recurring season 6)\n: JJ served as the communications liaison on the team to local police agencies in seasons 1\u20135. She dates and marries William LaMontagne ([[Josh Stewart]]), a [[New Orleans Police Department]] [[detective]]. They have two sons, Henry LaMontagne (Mekhai Andersen) and Michael LaMontagne (Phoenix Sky Andersen). Both boys are played by A.J. Cook's real-life sons. In the episode \"JJ\" (season 6), Jennifer is forced to accept a promotion at [[the Pentagon]], causing her departure from the team, although Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner expresses his hope that she will return to the BAU in the future. Jennifer returns in the episode \"Lauren\" (season 6) to assist the team in finding SSA Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]). Jennifer returns as a series regular in the season 7 premiere as a legitimate profiler and admits to helping fake Prentiss' death, much to dismay of her colleagues. In the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode, JJ is kidnapped because of a secret mission she performed while at the Pentagon. At the end of season 10, JJ reveals she is pregnant with her second child and consults over the phone for the few episodes of season 11 before rejoining the team in the field in the episode \"Target Rich\". \n* [[Penelope Garcia]] ([[Kirsten Vangsness]]), BAU technical analyst and BAU communications liaison (seasons 2\u201315; recurring season 1). Garcia joined the BAU after bringing attention to herself by illegally accessing some of their equipment, while she was an underground hacker; she is offered a job in lieu of a jail sentence. She submitted her resume to Hotch on pink stationery. She usually supports the team from her computer lab at Quantico but occasionally joins them on location when her skills can be used in the field. She is a leader in a support group for those who have lost someone in their lives. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when they were out looking for her when she was a teen and had missed her curfew. She enjoys a flirtatious relationship with SSA Derek Morgan, often engaging in comical banter of a sexually suggestive nature when he calls for information. He calls her \"Baby Girl\". She was once shot and almost killed by Jason Clark Battle, who lured her on a date in the episode \"Lucky\" (season 3). When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Penelope and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner take over her job as communications liaison. She is kidnapped once again at the end of season 13. SSA Sam Cooper (''[[Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior]]'') often calls when his team needs her computer skills. Penelope is the godmother of Jennifer's son, Henry, and the godmother of Morgan's son, Hank.\n* [[Emily Prentiss]] ([[Paget Brewster]]), supervisory special agent and BAU Unit Chief<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starrymag.com/kirsten-vangness-diani-devine-meet-the-apocalypse/ |title=Kirsten Vangsness \u2013 Diani & Devine Meet The Apocalypse|work=Starry Mag|last=Steinberg|first=Lisa|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}</ref> (seasons 2\u20137, 12\u201315; guest seasons 9, 11)\n: Prentiss is the daughter of Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss ([[Kate Jackson]]). After SSA Elle Greenaway leaves the BAU, Section Chief [[Erin Strauss]] approves Emily to join the BAU. The plan was for Emily to report any problems within the BAU, but Emily remained loyal to the team and refused to report any problems, going so far as threatening resignation. Emily is also fluent in several languages, such as Spanish, French, Greek, and Arabic, has a working knowledge in Italian, and was fluent in Russian at one point but has lost comprehension. She is apparently killed while being held hostage by Ian Doyle in the episode \"Lauren\" (season 6), but in the last scene of the episode, it is revealed that she survived her encounter with Ian and is seen with SSA Jennifer Jareau in Paris passing her passports and bank accounts for protection. In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), she returns alive and well, much to the team's surprise. In the season 7 finale (\"Run\"), Emily decides to leave the BAU after accepting a position running and returning to the [[Interpol]] office in [[London]]. She returns for the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode to help rescue a kidnapped SSA Jennifer Jareau and again in the episode \"Tribute\" (season 11), where she enlists the help of the BAU in catching a serial killer who had originally killed in Europe before killing in the United States. Paget Brewster was confirmed to return for a several episode arc in season 12. Following the dismissal of Thomas Gibson, Brewster was promoted to a series regular again starting from season 12, episode 3; later Prentiss is promoted to Hotch's position of unit chief.\n* [[David Rossi]] ([[Joe Mantegna]]), senior supervisory special agent (seasons 3\u201315)\n: Rossi is a highly experienced profiler who once worked the BAU in its origins, then took early retirement in 1997 to write books and go on lecture tours about criminal analysis, until volunteering to return shortly after SSA Jason Gideon's departure in 2007. He has been married three times and is quite wealthy because of his successful writing career. In the episode \"From Childhood's Hour\" (season 7), David reconnects with his first wife, Carolyn Baker, who has shocking news for him. It is revealed that she came to him because she was diagnosed with ALS ([[Lou Gehrig's disease]]) and wants David to assist in her suicide. In the next episode (\"Epilogue\"), Carolyn dies after taking a drug overdose. It is also revealed in this episode that David had a son who died at birth. In the season 8 episode \"The Fallen\", it is revealed that David was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] in Vietnam. The season 7 finale (\"Hit\") reveals SSA David Rossi may be having a secret relationship with Section Chief Erin Strauss; this was discovered when technical analyst Penelope Garcia and SSA Dr. Spencer Reid spot them both leaving a hotel. In the last season 8 episode (\"The Replicator\") we see their relationship has been known to the entire team. The episode is an emotional one for SSA David Rossi since Unit Chief Erin Strauss is murdered by The Replicator. She was taken from her hotel room, where he had planned to meet her that night, drugged and put on the streets of New York disoriented for Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner to find her. The episode's last scene is SSA David Rossi eulogizing her to the team after her funeral, at a gathering at his home. In season 10 we learn that David has a daughter by his second wife. Since then, he is shown to have a strong relationship with his daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, even approving of her husband's Italian heritage. In season 11 Rossi reunites with his second wife, and they give their relationship a second chance.\n* [[Ashley Seaver]] ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), FBI cadet and special agent (season 6)\n: Seaver replaces SSA Jennifer Jareau after she is forced to accept a promotion at the Pentagon. She was chosen for her unique background; her father, Charles Beauchamp, was a horrific serial killer known as the \"Redmond Ripper\", who murdered dozens of women before being caught by the BAU, incidentally. At first, Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner was going to make her a special one-time consultant to the BAU, but SSA David Rossi allowed her to finish her remedial training with the team, under the supervision of SSA Emily Prentiss. In the episode \"... With Friends Like These\" (season 6), she graduated from the Academy and had been added to the team as a \"probationary agent\". In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), Jennifer reveals to Emily that Ashley transferred to the domestic trafficking task force, which is led by Andi Swann.\n* [[Alex Blake (Criminal Minds)|Alex Blake]] ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), FBI [[linguistics]] expert, supervisory special agent,  and professor at [[Georgetown University]] (seasons 8\u20139)\n: Blake once worked for the BAU during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] but retired after a conflict with Chief [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] and rejoins the BAU after SSA Emily Prentiss transfers to the [[Interpol]] office in London. Alex first appears in the season 8 premiere (\"The Silencer\"). She makes a personal connection with Spencer Reid after he reveals to her that he has begun a romantic relationship with a woman whom he has never met. In the season 9 finale, after a difficult case in Texas in which the team is targeted by a group of corrupt sheriff deputies and Reid is shot, she escorts Reid to his apartment, explaining that the experience brought back memories of her son's death and that Reid reminds her of him. She leaves behind her credentials, which Reid finds in his bag before seeing Blake leave in a taxi, saddened but understanding. \n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kate Callahan|Kate Callahan]] ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), Former FBI undercover agent and supervisory special agent (season 10)\n: Callahan, as mentioned in the season 10 premiere, previously worked under Andi Swann's team, which is also Ashley Seaver's team since she left the BAU. She is a \"seasoned undercover agent whose stellar work at the FBI has landed her a coveted position with the Behavioral Analysis Unit\". She and her husband, Chris, have been the guardians of Kate's teenage niece, Meg, since Meg was a baby following her parents' deaths in the [[September 11, 2001]], attacks. Kate and Chris discover they are expecting a baby in the middle of season 10, coinciding with the actress's real-life pregnancy. At the end of season 10 she decides to take a year off and raise her baby.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harnick|first1=Chris|title=Jennifer Love Hewitt Joins Criminal Minds as Series Regular|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/556111/jennifer-love-hewitt-joins-criminal-minds-as-series-regular|work=[[E!#E!

Her dream was to study psychopaths up close and personal\u2014and her psychology background, combined with her experience in the FBI, brought her face to face with monsters. Her job was to stare them down and interview them, to determine if they were fit to stand trial. Lewis replaced both JJ ([[A.J. Cook]]) and Kate ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) while they were on maternity leave in the 11th season.\n* [[Luke Alvez]] ([[Adam Rodriguez (actor)|Adam Rodriguez]]), fugitive task force agent and supervisory special agent (seasons 12\u201315)\n: Alvez is a member of the FBI fugitive task force that partners with the BAU to catch the serial killers that escaped in the season 11 finale.<ref name=\"Time Inc\"/> In the season 12 premiere, he works with the BAU to catch the \"Crimson King\", one of the escapees that attacked Alvez's old partner. The team discovers the real killer is \"Mr. Scratch\", who taunts the team by turning over the real \"Crimson King\", who was tortured to the point he no longer remembers who he was. After that, Alvez decides to join the BAU full time and was Hotch's last hire. Alvez has a Belgian [[Tervuren dog]] named Roxy (whom Garcia thought at first was his human girlfriend) and served in Iraq as an Army Ranger prior to joining the FBI.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Stephen Walker|Stephen Walker]] ([[Damon Gupton]]), supervisory special agent (season 12)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/06/criminal-minds-damon-gupton-exits-cbs-series-one-season-1202111448/|title='Criminal Minds': Damon Gupton Leaving CBS Series After One Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n: Walker is a supervisory special agent with the BAU. Walker was a member of the Behavioral Analysis Program. He was contacted by Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]) about joining the BAU to assist in the manhunt for Peter Lewis, a k a \"Mr. Scratch\". Walker is an experienced profiler with about 20 years under his belt and a member of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Program before his transfer to the BAU. He is married to a woman named Monica and has two children with her, Maya and Eli. He met Emily Prentiss, then the chief of Interpol's London office, during his line of work. He was also mentored by David Rossi ([[Joe Mantegna]]). Stephen's first case concerned a terrorist cell in Belgium, and three agents were sent undercover to infiltrate it. However, Stephen's profile was wrong, and this resulted in the deaths of the undercover agents. He eventually moved on from the trauma and improved as he went along in his career. He and other BAP agents, including his longtime friend Sam Bower, were sent undercover to investigate corruption in the Russian government. Walker's skills include being fluent in Russian and playing the trombone. In the season 13 premiere, it is revealed he had died in the car crash Mr. Scratch had arranged as a trap for the team at the end of season 12.\n* [[Matt Simmons (Criminal Minds)|Matt Simmons]] ([[Daniel Henney]]) (seasons 13\u201315; guest seasons 10, 12)  supervisory special agent, and former member of the [[Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders|International Response Team]].<ref name=\"danielhenneyCM\" />\n: Simmons is a special operations agent and formerly worked with the IRT. Simmons has a wife, Kristy (Kelly Frye), and has a total of four children, including two boys (Jake and David) and twin daughters, all of them under the age of 3. He was a former member of a special ops unit, and his experience with the unit allowed him to hone his profiling skills. Following the disbandment of the IRT, Simmons assists the BAU in taking down Mr. Scratch, and is later recruited to the BAU as a replacement for the late Stephen Walker, becoming the last addition to the team in the series. At the end of the fourteenth season, Simmons and Kristy announce their pregnancy with the fifth child, and the following year, Kristy gives birth to daughter Rosemary Simmons (whom her parents had attempted to name after colleague David Rossi).\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] ([[Jayne Atkinson]]; seasons 2\u20133, 5\u20139), an assistant director and the BAU Unit Chief's direct superior. While her FBI experience was primarily in administration, SSA Derek Morgan remarked on her masterly marksmanship, after observing her at a firing range. In early episodes, Strauss appeared only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau, going so far as to force SSA Jennifer Jareau to accept a promotion to the Pentagon in the episode \"JJ\" (season 6). Further character development revealed her alcohol abuse. After being confronted by Morgan and Hotchner, Strauss accepts help and achieves sobriety. In the season 8 finale, [[List of Criminal Minds characters#John Curtis, \"The Replicator\"|the Replicator]] breaks into Strauss's hotel room in New York, drugs her, and forces her\u2014at gunpoint\u2014to drink alcohol from her room's minibar. Hotchner finds her on a bench near the hotel, where Strauss dies in his arms. Her death is avenged when Rossi traps the Replicator in an exploding house. Fittingly, Strauss's sobriety helps defeat the Replicator as Rossi uses her sobriety chip to escape the Replicator's trap and taunts him with it. After attending her funeral, the members of the BAU gather in a still-emotional Rossi's backyard, reminisce, and toast her memory. Showrunner [[Erica Messer]] chose to kill Strauss off because she felt that the character had come full circle since she was first introduced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eng|first=Joyce|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Criminal-Minds-Finale-Postmortem-Replicator-Revealed-Death-1065988.aspx|title=Criminal Minds Boss on The Replicator Reveal, the Finale Death and What's Next in Season 9|work=[[TV Guide]]|location=[[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]]|publisher=[[NTVB Media (magazine)|NTVB Media]] [[CBS Interactive]] ([[CBS Corporation]]) (digital assets)|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref>  \n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Haley Hotchner|Haley Hotchner]] ([[Meredith Monroe]]; seasons 1\u20133, 5, 9) is Agent Aaron Hotchner's wife and the mother of his only son, Jack Hotchner, born in late 2005. The couple's marriage was troubled, as clues were revealed in season 3 that she may have been having an affair and walked out on him. She later appeared with divorce papers, and he accepted reluctantly so as not to cause any trouble for his son with the divorce. In the episode \"100\" (season 5), Haley and Jack were captured by a killer known as \"The Reaper\"; though Jack was saved, Haley was shot and died before Aaron could save her. Aaron later beat The Reaper to death. In the episode \"Route 66\", Hotch collapses from internal bleeding and dreams about Haley. She tells him that he should stop blaming himself for her death and to make sure Jack knows that he can talk about his mother's death. Haley leaves Hotch by telling him that he and Beth have a good relationship and he shouldn't mess it up by not telling her how he feels.\n* Jessica Brooks (Molly Baker; seasons 1, 3, 5, 9\u201311), is Agent Aaron Hotchner's sister-in-law, Jack's aunt, and Haley's sister.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Jordan Todd|Jordan Todd]] ([[Meta Golding]]; season 4) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's handpicked replacement to serve as the BAU's media director during Jennifer's maternity leave, from late 2008 through early 2009. Jordan had formerly served in the FBI counterterrorism division, but follows Jennifer for only day of shadowing before Jennifer goes into labor. Jordan seemed to get along well with most of the team, even flirting platonically with SSA [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]]. She is especially close with SSA David Rossi, who is seen to counsel her while they are on cases. However, Jordan has clashed several times with Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner. She eventually leaves when she decides she can't handle the stress that comes with her job.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Diana Reid|Diana Reid]] ([[Jane Lynch]]; seasons 1, 2, 4, 12 & 15) is the mother of BAU team member Dr. Spencer Reid. Like her son, she has a high IQ. She was once a university professor of literature, but suffers from schizophrenia and is hospitalized in a Las Vegas sanitarium, where Spencer committed her when he was 18. Her husband, William Reid, left prior to her diagnosis, because of his inability to cope with her illness, and he could not deal with protecting her after she witnessed a murder. She is functional when on her medication, but frequently lapses into regression to her university career. Diana spent much time reading aloud to Spencer while he was growing up, and he continues to write her a letter every day. She is proud of her son but disapproves of the FBI, as it is a government-run organization; she refers to his colleagues as \"fascists\". She seems to be showing signs of improvement in later episodes, when Reid states that she went on a supervised field trip to the Grand Canyon without feeling the need to notify Reid. However, she did not forget him, as Reid later receives a postcard and a gift from her.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#William LaMontagne, Jr|William LaMontagne Jr.]] ([[Josh Stewart]]; season 2\u20135, 7\u20139, 11\u201315) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's husband and the father of Jennifer's sons, Henry and Michael.

It is also stated that the couple had made a deal that in a life-threatening situation, they would do everything so that one of them could live to look after Henry. Jennifer accepted his marriage proposal and they were married officially; however, when their son was born, they exchanged rings with insets of Henry's birthstone, citrine. He is seen briefly in the 100th episode getting medicine for Henry with Jennifer, as well as the episode \"The Slave of Duty\" (season 5), accompanying Jennifer and the team at Haley Hotchner's funeral. In the season 7 finale, Will works alongside JJ to stop the bank robbers and is eventually taken hostage. Afterward, they agree to get married and unknowingly attend a surprise wedding ceremony thrown by Rossi and Will. \n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kevin Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]; season 3\u201310) first appears in the episode \"Penelope\" (season 3), in which he is required to search Penelope Garcia's computer to learn who shot her. Kevin sends the team live video alerting that the unsub (unknown subject) is in the BAU headquarters. He is intensely impressed by Penelope's computer skills, and the feeling is mutual. At the end of the episode, Penelope is introduced to Kevin, and the two become romantically involved. In the episode \"I Love You, Tommy Brown\" (season 7), Kevin proposes to Penelope, but she turns him down, saying that \"things are going too fast\", and ultimately the couple break up.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Mateo Cruz|Mateo Cruz]] ([[Esai Morales]]; season 9\u201310) takes over from the late Erin Strauss as the new BAU section chief in season 9.

They are both physically and mentally tortured into giving the access codes given to them during the mission. He is shocked to discover that Michael Hastings ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), one of the men with whom they had worked on the task force, was the mastermind behind the plan and threatened to rape JJ to give him the access codes. He gives in and is later stabbed by Askari, who is quickly killed by Hotch.

They first arrive to investigate a series of murders involving prostitutes, but as they investigate, the team soon finds that they are caught in a ring of corrupt deputies\u2014ironically the only officer not involved being Sheriff Coleman\u2014and find their lives in danger. After a fatal shootout with the corrupt, drug-peddling Preacher Mills ([[Brett Cullen]]), Sheriff Coleman is killed, Morgan is wounded, and Reid is critically wounded and hospitalized as a result. Distraught by this turn of events, Cruz travels to Texas with Garcia to help the team investigate and apprehend the ring leader, Deputy Owen McGregor ([[Michael Trucco]]). He is not seen again until late in season 10 (episode 19, \"Beyond Borders\") when he needs the BAU to help the FBI's international team, led by [[Jack Garrett (Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders)|Jack Garrett]] ([[Gary Sinise]]), to catch an unsub who has kidnapped a family while on vacation in Barbados. The case is especially critical because this unsub has eluded both the domestic and international BAU teams by killing a family in Aruba, then in Florida one year later.

After a series of emotionally troubling cases and the murder of his friend Sarah by fugitive serial killer Frank Breitkopf ([[Keith Carradine]]), he begins to feel burned out. The last straw occurs when Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner is suspended for two weeks by the team's boss\u2014an action for which Jason feels responsible. He retreats to his cabin and leaves a letter for Dr. Spencer Reid, who he knows will be the one to look for him. When Spencer arrives at the cabin, he finds the letter and Jason's FBI credentials and firearm. Jason is last seen remarking to a Nevada diner waitress that he does not know where he is going or how he will know when he gets there, leaving the diner and driving off. In season 10, he is killed (off-screen) by a suspect he had tracked down from one of his first cases.\n* [[Aaron Hotchner]] ([[Thomas Gibson]]), Former BAU unit chief and senior supervisory special agent (seasons 1\u201312)\n: Hotch is a former [[prosecutor]] and was originally assigned to the FBI field office in Seattle. He is one of the most experienced agents in the BAU. He struggles to balance the demands of his job with his family life, but his wife, Haley Brooks ([[Meredith Monroe]]), divorces him in season 3. In the episode \"[[100 (Criminal Minds)|100]]\" (season 5), Haley is killed by [[fugitive]] [[serial killer]] George Foyet ([[C. Thomas Howell]]), also known as \"The Boston Reaper\", whom Aaron fights and beats to death. He also has a son named Jack (Cade Owens) and a brother named Sean. After Haley is murdered, he has custody of Jack, and Haley's sister, Jessica Brooks (Molly Baker), helps him take care of Jack. When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Aaron and technical analyst Penelope Garcia take over her job as communications liaison. Aaron dated a woman named Beth Clemmons ([[Bellamy Young]]), who first appeared in the episode \"The Bittersweet Science\" (season 7), before the couple separated after Clemmons accepted a job in Hong Kong. Following an on-set altercation, Thomas Gibson was removed from the main cast after season 12, episode 2, at which point Hotch went on temporary assignment. In a later episode, it's revealed Aaron and Jack went into witness protection after Jack was being stalked by Peter \"Mr. Scratch\" Lewis, a serial killer from a previous BAU case. Following Lewis's death in the 13th season premiere, Prentiss reveals that Aaron has opted not to return to the BAU, but instead to retire to be a full-time parent to Jack.\n* [[Elle Greenaway]] ([[Lola Glaudini]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|Supervisory Special Agent]] (seasons 1\u20132)\n:Greenaway is assigned to the FBI field office in [[Seattle]] and assigned to the BAU as an expert in sexual offense crimes. Elle suffers extreme emotional trauma after being shot by an [[Person of interest|unsub]] in the season 1 finale (\"The Fisher King (Part 1)\"). In the season 2 premiere (\"The Fisher King (Part 2)\"), Elle survives and returns to duty sooner than SSA Jason Gideon and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner would like. Several episodes later, while alone on stakeout of a suspected serial rapist, she murders the suspect by shooting him in cold blood and planting her gun on the unarmed victim. The local police deem it self-defense, but Jason and Aaron question her ability as a profiler after this. Elle resigns, turning in her badge and gun to Aaron, declaring that it is \"not an admission of guilt\".\n* [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]] ([[Shemar Moore]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special Agent]] (seasons 1\u201311; guest star seasons 12\u201313)\n: Morgan is a confident, assertive, and often hot-tempered character. He was raised by his mother, Fran, along with his two sisters, Sarah Morgan and Desiree Benita, after the death of his police officer father right in front of him. Derek was a troubled Chicago youth headed for [[juvenile delinquency]]. He was rescued and mentored by Carl Buford (Julius Tennon). Buford turned out to be a [[sexual predator]] who [[child molestation|molested]] Derek and other young boys; he was eventually arrested for murder. After developing an interest in football, Derek attended [[Northwestern University]] on a [[scholarship]]. After a football injury left him unable to play, he joined the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s [[bomb squad]] and later joined the FBI and the BAU. He has an emotionally intimate, but [[Platonic love|platonic]], relationship with technical analyst Penelope Garcia; the two have a unique shorthand and banter. In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), Derek shows utter hatred toward Ian Doyle (Timothy V. Murphy) for killing SSA Emily Prentiss, but when Emily returns alive, he has mixed feelings. In season 11, Derek is kidnapped and tortured by the father of Giuseppe Montolo, a hitman whom Derek put away and who later died while in custody. Derek escapes and when he learns his girlfriend Savannah is pregnant, he realizes that he doesn't want to put his family through something like this again. Derek leaves the BAU in the episode \"A Beautiful Disaster\" to care for his now-wife and newborn son.\n* [[Spencer Reid]] ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|supervisory special agent]] (all seasons)\n: Reid is a genius who graduated from [[Las Vegas High School]] at age 12 and holds Ph.D.s in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[engineering]] as well as [[bachelor of arts]] degrees in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] and, as of season 4, is working on a B.A. in [[philosophy]]. It has been revealed that he has an [[IQ]] of 187, can read a dizzying 20,000 words per minute, and has an [[eidetic memory]]. Most of the members on the team are intimidated by his profound knowledge. He is habitually introduced as \"Dr. Spencer Reid\" in contrast to the other agents, who are introduced as \"supervisory special agent\". The purpose of this, as explained by Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner in the pilot episode (\"[[Extreme Aggressor (Criminal Minds Episode)|Extreme Aggressor]]\"), is to create a respectable first impression of Spencer, deflecting judgments about his age. His mother, Diana Reid ([[Jane Lynch]]), suffers from [[schizophrenia]] and is currently committed to a mental institution. In season 6 Reid starts suffering from cluster headaches and when doctors can't diagnose why, Reid thinks he might be in the early stages of schizophrenia himself. Reid takes SSA Emily Prentiss' death very hard and, when it was revealed the death was faked, was distrustful of both Prentiss and SSA Jennifer Jareau (who helped in the cover-up). During season 8, Reid becomes involved with a woman who was being stalked. In the episode \"Zugzwang\", her stalker ultimately kidnaps her and kills her, devastating Reid. In season 11 he is deeply affected by Derek Morgan's decision to leave the BAU but understands and supports his reasons. Initially Reid had a crush on JJ, even going as far as taking her on a date to a football game. As the series progresses, their relationship becomes more of the brother\u2013sister kind. Morgan and Reid maintained a brotherly relationship and Morgan refers to Reid as his \"little brother\" prior to his departure in season 11. Spencer is also the godfather of Jennifer's son, Henry, and Derek's son, Hank. In one episode Reid is himself arrested and finds himself in jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hWzuR-hKfE|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/news/1006659/9-burning-questions-we-have-about-criminal-minds-dr-reid/|title=9 Burning Questions We Have About Dr. Reid's Arrest - CBS.com|website=CBS|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau]] ([[A. J. Cook]]), former BAU communications liaison and current supervisory special agent (seasons 1\u20135, 7\u201315; recurring season 6)\n: JJ served as the communications liaison on the team to local police agencies in seasons 1\u20135. She dates and marries William LaMontagne ([[Josh Stewart]]), a [[New Orleans Police Department]] [[detective]]. They have two sons, Henry LaMontagne (Mekhai Andersen) and Michael LaMontagne (Phoenix Sky Andersen). Both boys are played by A.J. Cook's real-life sons. In the episode \"JJ\" (season 6), Jennifer is forced to accept a promotion at [[the Pentagon]], causing her departure from the team, although Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner expresses his hope that she will return to the BAU in the future. Jennifer returns in the episode \"Lauren\" (season 6) to assist the team in finding SSA Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]). Jennifer returns as a series regular in the season 7 premiere as a legitimate profiler and admits to helping fake Prentiss' death, much to dismay of her colleagues. In the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode, JJ is kidnapped because of a secret mission she performed while at the Pentagon. At the end of season 10, JJ reveals she is pregnant with her second child and consults over the phone for the few episodes of season 11 before rejoining the team in the field in the episode \"Target Rich\". \n* [[Penelope Garcia]] ([[Kirsten Vangsness]]), BAU technical analyst and BAU communications liaison (seasons 2\u201315; recurring season 1). Garcia joined the BAU after bringing attention to herself by illegally accessing some of their equipment, while she was an underground hacker; she is offered a job in lieu of a jail sentence. She submitted her resume to Hotch on pink stationery. She usually supports the team from her computer lab at Quantico but occasionally joins them on location when her skills can be used in the field. She is a leader in a support group for those who have lost someone in their lives. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when they were out looking for her when she was a teen and had missed her curfew. She enjoys a flirtatious relationship with SSA Derek Morgan, often engaging in comical banter of a sexually suggestive nature when he calls for information. He calls her \"Baby Girl\". She was once shot and almost killed by Jason Clark Battle, who lured her on a date in the episode \"Lucky\" (season 3). When SSA Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU, Penelope and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner take over her job as communications liaison. She is kidnapped once again at the end of season 13. SSA Sam Cooper (''[[Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior]]'') often calls when his team needs her computer skills. Penelope is the godmother of Jennifer's son, Henry, and the godmother of Morgan's son, Hank.\n* [[Emily Prentiss]] ([[Paget Brewster]]), supervisory special agent and BAU Unit Chief<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starrymag.com/kirsten-vangness-diani-devine-meet-the-apocalypse/ |title=Kirsten Vangsness \u2013 Diani & Devine Meet The Apocalypse|work=Starry Mag|last=Steinberg|first=Lisa|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}</ref> (seasons 2\u20137, 12\u201315; guest seasons 9, 11)\n: Prentiss is the daughter of Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss ([[Kate Jackson]]). After SSA Elle Greenaway leaves the BAU, Section Chief [[Erin Strauss]] approves Emily to join the BAU. The plan was for Emily to report any problems within the BAU, but Emily remained loyal to the team and refused to report any problems, going so far as threatening resignation. Emily is also fluent in several languages, such as Spanish, French, Greek, and Arabic, has a working knowledge in Italian, and was fluent in Russian at one point but has lost comprehension. She is apparently killed while being held hostage by Ian Doyle in the episode \"Lauren\" (season 6), but in the last scene of the episode, it is revealed that she survived her encounter with Ian and is seen with SSA Jennifer Jareau in Paris passing her passports and bank accounts for protection. In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), she returns alive and well, much to the team's surprise. In the season 7 finale (\"Run\"), Emily decides to leave the BAU after accepting a position running and returning to the [[Interpol]] office in [[London]]. She returns for the [[200 (Criminal Minds)|200th]] episode to help rescue a kidnapped SSA Jennifer Jareau and again in the episode \"Tribute\" (season 11), where she enlists the help of the BAU in catching a serial killer who had originally killed in Europe before killing in the United States. Paget Brewster was confirmed to return for a several episode arc in season 12. Following the dismissal of Thomas Gibson, Brewster was promoted to a series regular again starting from season 12, episode 3; later Prentiss is promoted to Hotch's position of unit chief.\n* [[David Rossi]] ([[Joe Mantegna]]), senior supervisory special agent (seasons 3\u201315)\n: Rossi is a highly experienced profiler who once worked the BAU in its origins, then took early retirement in 1997 to write books and go on lecture tours about criminal analysis, until volunteering to return shortly after SSA Jason Gideon's departure in 2007. He has been married three times and is quite wealthy because of his successful writing career. In the episode \"From Childhood's Hour\" (season 7), David reconnects with his first wife, Carolyn Baker, who has shocking news for him. It is revealed that she came to him because she was diagnosed with ALS ([[Lou Gehrig's disease]]) and wants David to assist in her suicide. In the next episode (\"Epilogue\"), Carolyn dies after taking a drug overdose. It is also revealed in this episode that David had a son who died at birth. In the season 8 episode \"The Fallen\", it is revealed that David was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] in Vietnam. The season 7 finale (\"Hit\") reveals SSA David Rossi may be having a secret relationship with Section Chief Erin Strauss; this was discovered when technical analyst Penelope Garcia and SSA Dr. Spencer Reid spot them both leaving a hotel. In the last season 8 episode (\"The Replicator\") we see their relationship has been known to the entire team. The episode is an emotional one for SSA David Rossi since Unit Chief Erin Strauss is murdered by The Replicator. She was taken from her hotel room, where he had planned to meet her that night, drugged and put on the streets of New York disoriented for Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner to find her. The episode's last scene is SSA David Rossi eulogizing her to the team after her funeral, at a gathering at his home. In season 10 we learn that David has a daughter by his second wife. Since then, he is shown to have a strong relationship with his daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, even approving of her husband's Italian heritage. In season 11 Rossi reunites with his second wife, and they give their relationship a second chance.\n* [[Ashley Seaver]] ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), FBI cadet and special agent (season 6)\n: Seaver replaces SSA Jennifer Jareau after she is forced to accept a promotion at the Pentagon. She was chosen for her unique background; her father, Charles Beauchamp, was a horrific serial killer known as the \"Redmond Ripper\", who murdered dozens of women before being caught by the BAU, incidentally. At first, Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner was going to make her a special one-time consultant to the BAU, but SSA David Rossi allowed her to finish her remedial training with the team, under the supervision of SSA Emily Prentiss. In the episode \"... With Friends Like These\" (season 6), she graduated from the Academy and had been added to the team as a \"probationary agent\". In the season 7 premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), Jennifer reveals to Emily that Ashley transferred to the domestic trafficking task force, which is led by Andi Swann.\n* [[Alex Blake (Criminal Minds)|Alex Blake]] ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), FBI [[linguistics]] expert, supervisory special agent,  and professor at [[Georgetown University]] (seasons 8\u20139)\n: Blake once worked for the BAU during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] but retired after a conflict with Chief [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] and rejoins the BAU after SSA Emily Prentiss transfers to the [[Interpol]] office in London. Alex first appears in the season 8 premiere (\"The Silencer\"). She makes a personal connection with Spencer Reid after he reveals to her that he has begun a romantic relationship with a woman whom he has never met. In the season 9 finale, after a difficult case in Texas in which the team is targeted by a group of corrupt sheriff deputies and Reid is shot, she escorts Reid to his apartment, explaining that the experience brought back memories of her son's death and that Reid reminds her of him. She leaves behind her credentials, which Reid finds in his bag before seeing Blake leave in a taxi, saddened but understanding. \n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kate Callahan|Kate Callahan]] ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), Former FBI undercover agent and supervisory special agent (season 10)\n: Callahan, as mentioned in the season 10 premiere, previously worked under Andi Swann's team, which is also Ashley Seaver's team since she left the BAU.

She and her husband, Chris, have been the guardians of Kate's teenage niece, Meg, since Meg was a baby following her parents' deaths in the [[September 11, 2001]], attacks. Kate and Chris discover they are expecting a baby in the middle of season 10, coinciding with the actress's real-life pregnancy.

Her dream was to study psychopaths up close and personal\u2014and her psychology background, combined with her experience in the FBI, brought her face to face with monsters. Her job was to stare them down and interview them, to determine if they were fit to stand trial. Lewis replaced both JJ ([[A.J. Cook]]) and Kate ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) while they were on maternity leave in the 11th season.\n* [[Luke Alvez]] ([[Adam Rodriguez (actor)|Adam Rodriguez]]), fugitive task force agent and supervisory special agent (seasons 12\u201315)\n: Alvez is a member of the FBI fugitive task force that partners with the BAU to catch the serial killers that escaped in the season 11 finale.<ref name=\"Time Inc\"/> In the season 12 premiere, he works with the BAU to catch the \"Crimson King\", one of the escapees that attacked Alvez's old partner. The team discovers the real killer is \"Mr. Scratch\", who taunts the team by turning over the real \"Crimson King\", who was tortured to the point he no longer remembers who he was. After that, Alvez decides to join the BAU full time and was Hotch's last hire. Alvez has a Belgian [[Tervuren dog]] named Roxy (whom Garcia thought at first was his human girlfriend) and served in Iraq as an Army Ranger prior to joining the FBI.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Stephen Walker|Stephen Walker]] ([[Damon Gupton]]), supervisory special agent (season 12)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/06/criminal-minds-damon-gupton-exits-cbs-series-one-season-1202111448/|title='Criminal Minds': Damon Gupton Leaving CBS Series After One Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n: Walker is a supervisory special agent with the BAU. Walker was a member of the Behavioral Analysis Program. He was contacted by Emily Prentiss ([[Paget Brewster]]) about joining the BAU to assist in the manhunt for Peter Lewis, a k a \"Mr. Scratch\". Walker is an experienced profiler with about 20 years under his belt and a member of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Program before his transfer to the BAU. He is married to a woman named Monica and has two children with her, Maya and Eli. He met Emily Prentiss, then the chief of Interpol's London office, during his line of work. He was also mentored by David Rossi ([[Joe Mantegna]]). Stephen's first case concerned a terrorist cell in Belgium, and three agents were sent undercover to infiltrate it. However, Stephen's profile was wrong, and this resulted in the deaths of the undercover agents. He eventually moved on from the trauma and improved as he went along in his career. He and other BAP agents, including his longtime friend Sam Bower, were sent undercover to investigate corruption in the Russian government. Walker's skills include being fluent in Russian and playing the trombone. In the season 13 premiere, it is revealed he had died in the car crash Mr. Scratch had arranged as a trap for the team at the end of season 12.\n* [[Matt Simmons (Criminal Minds)|Matt Simmons]] ([[Daniel Henney]]) (seasons 13\u201315; guest seasons 10, 12)  supervisory special agent, and former member of the [[Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders|International Response Team]].<ref name=\"danielhenneyCM\" />\n: Simmons is a special operations agent and formerly worked with the IRT. Simmons has a wife, Kristy (Kelly Frye), and has a total of four children, including two boys (Jake and David) and twin daughters, all of them under the age of 3. He was a former member of a special ops unit, and his experience with the unit allowed him to hone his profiling skills. Following the disbandment of the IRT, Simmons assists the BAU in taking down Mr. Scratch, and is later recruited to the BAU as a replacement for the late Stephen Walker, becoming the last addition to the team in the series. At the end of the fourteenth season, Simmons and Kristy announce their pregnancy with the fifth child, and the following year, Kristy gives birth to daughter Rosemary Simmons (whom her parents had attempted to name after colleague David Rossi).\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Erin Strauss|Erin Strauss]] ([[Jayne Atkinson]]; seasons 2\u20133, 5\u20139), an assistant director and the BAU Unit Chief's direct superior. While her FBI experience was primarily in administration, SSA Derek Morgan remarked on her masterly marksmanship, after observing her at a firing range. In early episodes, Strauss appeared only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau, going so far as to force SSA Jennifer Jareau to accept a promotion to the Pentagon in the episode \"JJ\" (season 6). Further character development revealed her alcohol abuse. After being confronted by Morgan and Hotchner, Strauss accepts help and achieves sobriety. In the season 8 finale, [[List of Criminal Minds characters#John Curtis, \"The Replicator\"|the Replicator]] breaks into Strauss's hotel room in New York, drugs her, and forces her\u2014at gunpoint\u2014to drink alcohol from her room's minibar. Hotchner finds her on a bench near the hotel, where Strauss dies in his arms. Her death is avenged when Rossi traps the Replicator in an exploding house. Fittingly, Strauss's sobriety helps defeat the Replicator as Rossi uses her sobriety chip to escape the Replicator's trap and taunts him with it. After attending her funeral, the members of the BAU gather in a still-emotional Rossi's backyard, reminisce, and toast her memory.

The couple's marriage was troubled, as clues were revealed in season 3 that she may have been having an affair and walked out on him. She later appeared with divorce papers, and he accepted reluctantly so as not to cause any trouble for his son with the divorce. In the episode \"100\" (season 5), Haley and Jack were captured by a killer known as \"The Reaper\"; though Jack was saved, Haley was shot and died before Aaron could save her. Aaron later beat The Reaper to death. In the episode \"Route 66\", Hotch collapses from internal bleeding and dreams about Haley. She tells him that he should stop blaming himself for her death and to make sure Jack knows that he can talk about his mother's death. Haley leaves Hotch by telling him that he and Beth have a good relationship and he shouldn't mess it up by not telling her how he feels.\n* Jessica Brooks (Molly Baker; seasons 1, 3, 5, 9\u201311), is Agent Aaron Hotchner's sister-in-law, Jack's aunt, and Haley's sister.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Jordan Todd|Jordan Todd]] ([[Meta Golding]]; season 4) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's handpicked replacement to serve as the BAU's media director during Jennifer's maternity leave, from late 2008 through early 2009.

Jordan seemed to get along well with most of the team, even flirting platonically with SSA [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]]. She is especially close with SSA David Rossi, who is seen to counsel her while they are on cases. However, Jordan has clashed several times with Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner. She eventually leaves when she decides she can't handle the stress that comes with her job.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Diana Reid|Diana Reid]] ([[Jane Lynch]]; seasons 1, 2, 4, 12 & 15) is the mother of BAU team member Dr. Spencer Reid.

Her husband, William Reid, left prior to her diagnosis, because of his inability to cope with her illness, and he could not deal with protecting her after she witnessed a murder. She is functional when on her medication, but frequently lapses into regression to her university career. Diana spent much time reading aloud to Spencer while he was growing up, and he continues to write her a letter every day. She is proud of her son but disapproves of the FBI, as it is a government-run organization; she refers to his colleagues as \"fascists\". She seems to be showing signs of improvement in later episodes, when Reid states that she went on a supervised field trip to the Grand Canyon without feeling the need to notify Reid. However, she did not forget him, as Reid later receives a postcard and a gift from her.\n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#William LaMontagne, Jr|William LaMontagne Jr.]] ([[Josh Stewart]]; season 2\u20135, 7\u20139, 11\u201315) is SSA Jennifer Jareau's husband and the father of Jennifer's sons, Henry and Michael.

Jennifer accepted his marriage proposal and they were married officially; however, when their son was born, they exchanged rings with insets of Henry's birthstone, citrine. He is seen briefly in the 100th episode getting medicine for Henry with Jennifer, as well as the episode \"The Slave of Duty\" (season 5), accompanying Jennifer and the team at Haley Hotchner's funeral. In the season 7 finale, Will works alongside JJ to stop the bank robbers and is eventually taken hostage. Afterward, they agree to get married and unknowingly attend a surprise wedding ceremony thrown by Rossi and Will. \n* [[List of Criminal Minds characters#Kevin Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]; season 3\u201310) first appears in the episode \"Penelope\" (season 3), in which he is required to search Penelope Garcia's computer to learn who shot her.

At the end of the episode, Penelope is introduced to Kevin, and the two become romantically involved.

The case is especially critical because this unsub has eluded both the domestic and international BAU teams by killing a family in Aruba, then in Florida one year later.

Primarily known for her grappling ability, Tate became a [[amateur wrestling|wrestler]] while attending Franklin Pierce High School in Tacoma, Washington and won a state championship during her senior year in 2005. She began her professional mixed martial arts (MMA) career in 2007, and won the bantamweight championship of the Freestyle Cage Fighting promotion in 2009. Tate gained increased recognition in 2011, when she won the [[List of Strikeforce champions#Women's Bantamweight Championship|Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Championship]]. She has also won a silver medal in the [[Submission wrestling#Combat sport|FILA Grappling Championships]].\n\nOutside of MMA, Tate has modeled for numerous websites and publications, including ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' and ''[[Fitness Gurls]]''. In 2015, Tate was announced as a cast member in the feature film ''Fight Valley''. Her fighting style, which focused on wrestling and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], has earned praise from multiple peers and media outlets. Ultimate Fighting Championship president [[Dana White]] has credited Tate's fight with [[Ronda Rousey]] on March 3, 2012 as the key factor in the creation of women's divisions in the UFC.<ref name=wd>{{cite news|title='All Access' video: White says Rousey would likely be first female UFC fighter|work=[[MMAjunkie.com]]|date=2012-08-09|accessdate=2013-06-01|url=http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2012/08/all-access-video-white-says-rousey-would-likely-be-first-female-ufc-fighter}}</ref>\n\nTate's final victory in MMA came on March 5, 2016, when she won the [[List of UFC Champions|UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship]] after beating [[Holly Holm]] via technical submission. On July 9, 2016, she lost the UFC title to [[Amanda Nunes]] at [[UFC 200]]. In November 2016, she announced her retirement from MMA after a loss by decision to [[Raquel Pennington]] at [[UFC 205]].<ref name=retirement>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=The Latest: Miesha Tate retiring after UFC 205 loss |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=2016-11-12 |accessdate=2016-11-12 |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2016-11-12/the-latest-carmouche-takes-first-ufc-bout-held-in-new-york}}</ref>\n\nPost retirement, Tate has become the VP for [[ONE Championship]] and currently lives in Singapore. She has continued to support MMA and still shows interest in competing in [[no-gi]] grappling matches, the first of which was against former MMA opponent [[Jessica Eye]] at Submission Underground 2, which Tate won in overtime.<ref name=grapplingmatchvseye>{{cite news|title=Miesha Tate defeats Jessica Eye at Submission Underground|work=BJPenn.com|date=2016-12-11 |accessdate=2017-01-22|url=http://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/miesha-tate/sug-2-results-miesha-tate-defeats-jessica-eye-controversial-match/}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTate was born in Tacoma, Washington to Michelle Tate and grew up raised by Michelle and husband Robert Schmidt. A tomboy during her youth, she often socialized with the boys in her neighborhood on playgrounds. While attending [[Franklin Pierce High School]], Tate sought a sport to participate in, and eventually chose [[amateur wrestling]] over basketball.<ref name=sdog/> She wrestled on the boys' team from her freshman year until graduation. \"I got my butt kicked pretty hard for the first few weeks. I had no idea what I was doing, like a fish out of water,\" Tate recalled in 2011.<ref name=sdog/> During her senior year in 2005, she competed in the girls' state championship and won the title.<ref name=sdog/>\n\nWhile Tate was attending [[Central Washington University]], a friend of hers encouraged her to attend the mixed martial arts (MMA) club with her. \"I went there, and it really was a bunch of wrestlers. I fit right in,\" Tate said.<ref name=sdog/> Upon joining, Tate became fascinated with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], a submission-based martial art which, like wrestling, is largely performed on the mat.\n\n===First MMA fight===\nIn addition to grappling, [[mixed martial arts]] permits the usage of strikes, which are forbidden in wrestling. Victory is usually achieved via a judges' decision, a stoppage due to strikes, or by forcing an opponent to submit. Tate was initially wary of competing in MMA, explaining that she \"didn't want to get punched.\"<ref name=sdog/> After seeing her training partners perform in actual competition, Tate was encouraged to accept her first amateur bout in March 2006, in which she was matched against Elizabeth Posener, a [[Muay Thai]] specialist.<ref name=Sprofile/>\n\nDuring the first round, Tate wrestled Posener to the mat, but did not strike while holding her there, which prompted Tate's trainers to remind her to.<ref name=sdog/>\nIn the second round, Posener bloodied Tate with a knee from inside a clinch. While looking back on the fight in 2012, Tate noted, \"I finally realized what I was there to do, and accepted the harsh truth\u2014this wasn't a wrestling match...it was a fight\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Trent|last=Reinsmith|title=Miesha Tate recalls her first MMA bout and when she realized she was a fighter\n|work=lowkickmma.com|date=2012-02-17|accessdate=2015-07-11|url=http://www.lowkickmma.com/Strikeforce/Miesha-Tate-recalls-her-first-MMA-bout-and-when-she-realized-she-was-a-fighter-15174/}}</ref> Tate escaped a submission attempt and responded by \"whaling down punches\" while Posener was on her back for the remainder of the round.<ref name=sdog/> Despite her eagerness to continue, Tate's corner ended the bout after the second round due to the injury she'd sustained. Tate later commented, \"When I get hurt or damaged, I fight that much harder.\"<ref name=sdog/>\n\nShe amassed a 5\u20131 amateur record in MMA before turning pro.<ref name=sdog/>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nTate made her professional debut in mixed martial arts in November 2007 at the one-night [[HOOKnSHOOT]] Women's Grand Prix. She defeated [[Jan Finney]] by decision, but was knocked out later in the night by a head-kick from eventual tournament champion [[Kaitlin Young]]. Throughout 2008 and 2009, Tate fought in several small organizations which did not regularly televise fights, defeating Jamie Lyn Welsh in CageSport MMA,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/events/CS-CageSport-MMA-9334|title=CS - CageSport MMA |website=Sherdog |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref> Jessica Bednark in Freestyle Cage Fighting (FCF), and Dora Baptiste in Atlas Fights.<ref name=Sprofile/>\n\n===First MMA title===\nTate captured the 135-pound FCF Women's [[Bantamweight (MMA)|Bantamweight]] Championship by defeating Liz Carreiro at Freestyle Cage Fighting 30 on April 4, 2009.

Fighting in the 135-pound bantamweight division, Tate defeated [[Elaina Maxwell]] by unanimous decision at [[Strikeforce: Melendez vs. Thomson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Thomson-Takes-Strikeforce-Title-in-San-Jose-13463 |title=Thomson Takes Strikeforce Title in San Jose |accessdate=2010-03-27 |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the FCF title in April 2009, she returned to Strikeforce at [[Strikeforce Challengers: Evangelista vs. Aina]] on May 15, 2009. Tate was originally scheduled to face [[Kim Couture]], but Couture withdrew from the fight due to undisclosed reasons and Tate was matched up against [[Sarah Kaufman (fighter)|Sarah Kaufman]] instead.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mmajunkie.com/news/14855/despite-opponent-change-miesha-tate-comfortable-with-win-win-situation.mma|title=Despite opponent change, Miesha Tate comfortable with \"win-win\" situation |accessdate=2010-02-10 |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=2009-05-12}}</ref> In a competitive fight, Tate was defeated by unanimous decision, which marked the first time that Kaufman had gone to a decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Aina-Takes-Evangelista-by-DQ-Kaufman-Remains-Undefeated-at-Strikeforce-17494 |title=Aina Takes Evangelista by DQ; Kaufman Remains Undefeated at Strikeforce |accessdate=2010-07-26 |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2009-05-16}}</ref>\n\nAfter stepping away to defend her FCF title in January 2010, Tate faced [[Zoila Gurgel]] at [[Strikeforce Challengers: Johnson vs. Mahe]] on March 26, 2010. Tate won the fight by armbar submission in the second round.<ref name=Eprofile/>\n\n====Strikeforce Bantamweight Champion====\nTate was then included in a one-night Strikeforce women's tournament on August 13, 2010 at [[Strikeforce Challengers: Riggs vs. Taylor]]. A random drawing was held on the day of the weigh-ins to determine first-round match-ups and Tate faced Maiju Kujala in the opening round of the tournament. She defeated Kujala by unanimous decision after two rounds to advance to the tournament final. She then defeated [[Hitomi Akano]] by unanimous decision after three rounds to become Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Tournament Champion.<ref name=tournament>{{cite news|first=John|last=Morgan|title=Strikeforce Challengers 10 recap: Miesha Tate tops tourney field |work=mmajunkie.com|date=2010-08-14|accessdate=2015-07-14|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2010/08/strikeforce-challengers-10-miesha-tate-takes-down-field-joe-riggs-victorious}}</ref>\n\nTate was scheduled to challenge [[Marloes Coenen]] for the [[List of Strikeforce champions#Women.27s Bantamweight Championship.2A|Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Championship]] on March 5, 2011, but withdrew from the fight after suffering a knee injury in training.<ref name=sdog/> The fight was rescheduled for [[Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Henderson]] on July 30, 2011. Going into the bout, Tate laughed while stating, \"I'm going to try to kill her, I really am. I'm going to try to get to the point where the referee is fearful [for] her life and stops the fight. That's my goal.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Miesha Tate: I'm going to try to kill Marloes Coenen|work=mixedmartialarts.com|date=|accessdate=2015-07-11|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/340979/Miesha-Im-going-to-try-to-kill-Marloes/}}</ref>\nCoenen, known for her jiu-jitsu pedigree, had never been submitted in a mixed martial arts bout.<ref name=Coenen>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Smith |title=Miesha Tate Submits Marloes Coenen in Strikeforce Title Fight |work=mmafighting.com |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2014-09-20 |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/07/30/miesha-tate-submits-marloes-coenen-in-strikeforce-title-fight}}</ref> In the fourth round, Tate defeated Coenen via submission (arm-triangle choke) to become the new champion.\n\nFollowing the fight, Tate stated, \"I think I'm not in reality quite yet. I can't believe that I have a belt to take home with me. I really had to dig deep those last couple rounds. Like I said, I had a tough end to my training camp, but I just feel like I went out there and I did what I needed to do and I won the fight and I'm world champion.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mmaweekly.com/strikeforce-fighter-of-the-night-miesha-tate-makes-statement-for-womens-mma|title=MMAWeekly.com\u2019s Strikeforce Fighter of the Night: Miesha Tate|date=2011-07-31|publisher=MMAWeekly.com|accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>\n\n====Final Strikeforce fights====\nTate's first title defense was expected to be against former opponent Sarah Kaufman. However, [[Ronda Rousey]], a new Strikeforce fighter, offered to fight Kaufman for the top-contender spot, seeking a title shot against Tate specifically. \"I really want to have a title fight against Miesha Tate.

Rousey had made her MMA debut in early 2011 and defeated all four of her opponents by first-round armbar submission. However, Tate did not believe that Rousey had earned a title shot, and felt that Rousey was largely gaining the opportunity due to being \"pretty.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Chiappetta|title=Miesha Tate, Ronda Rousey Spar Over Who Should Be Next Title Challenger|work=mmafighting.com|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=June 1, 2013|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/11/28/miesha-tate-ronda-rousey-spar-over-who-should-be-next-title-cha}}</ref> The two engaged in a variety of trash-talk, with Rousey stating that she was \"bored\" while watching Tate's win over Coenen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ronda Rousey sees title bout as self-manifested destiny|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 20, 2012|accessdate=June 1, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2012-02-20/ronda-rousey-sees-title-bout-as-self-manifested-destiny/631032/1}}</ref> Ultimately, Tate and Rousey headlined a [[Strikeforce: Tate vs. Rousey|Strikeforce show]] on March 3, 2012. This marked a then-rare occurrence of women being placed in the main event of an MMA card.<ref name=tr/> The bout was televised on Showtime and introduced by [[Jimmy Lennon, Jr.|Jimmy Lennon, Jr]]. Shortly after the fight began, Tate escaped Rousey's first armbar attempt and retaliated with strikes. After a back-and-forth session of grappling, Tate lost the title when Rousey secured a second armbar near the end of the first round, forcing her to submit.\n\nTate was criticized by the media for risking long-term damage to her arm by resisting the armbar for several moments.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ben |last=Fowlkes |title=Was submission victim Miesha Tate too tough for her own good? |work=Sports Illustrated |date=March 6, 2012 |url=http://si.com/2012/writers/ben_fowlkes/03/06/miesha-tate/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150125183425/http://si.com/2012/writers/ben_fowlkes/03/06/miesha-tate/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 25, 2015 |accessdate=June 1, 2013 }}</ref> Rousey later stated, \"Miesha impressed me, she's a tough chick 'cause that hurts.

A tomboy during her youth, she often socialized with the boys in her neighborhood on playgrounds. While attending [[Franklin Pierce High School]], Tate sought a sport to participate in, and eventually chose [[amateur wrestling]] over basketball.<ref name=sdog/> She wrestled on the boys' team from her freshman year until graduation. \"I got my butt kicked pretty hard for the first few weeks. I had no idea what I was doing, like a fish out of water,\" Tate recalled in 2011.<ref name=sdog/> During her senior year in 2005, she competed in the girls' state championship and won the title.<ref name=sdog/>\n\nWhile Tate was attending [[Central Washington University]], a friend of hers encouraged her to attend the mixed martial arts (MMA) club with her. \"I went there, and it really was a bunch of wrestlers. I fit right in,\" Tate said.<ref name=sdog/> Upon joining, Tate became fascinated with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], a submission-based martial art which, like wrestling, is largely performed on the mat.\n\n===First MMA fight===\nIn addition to grappling, [[mixed martial arts]] permits the usage of strikes, which are forbidden in wrestling. Victory is usually achieved via a judges' decision, a stoppage due to strikes, or by forcing an opponent to submit. Tate was initially wary of competing in MMA, explaining that she \"didn't want to get punched.\"<ref name=sdog/> After seeing her training partners perform in actual competition, Tate was encouraged to accept her first amateur bout in March 2006, in which she was matched against Elizabeth Posener, a [[Muay Thai]] specialist.<ref name=Sprofile/>\n\nDuring the first round, Tate wrestled Posener to the mat, but did not strike while holding her there, which prompted Tate's trainers to remind her to.<ref name=sdog/>\nIn the second round, Posener bloodied Tate with a knee from inside a clinch. While looking back on the fight in 2012, Tate noted, \"I finally realized what I was there to do, and accepted the harsh truth\u2014this wasn't a wrestling match...it was a fight\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Trent|last=Reinsmith|title=Miesha Tate recalls her first MMA bout and when she realized she was a fighter\n|work=lowkickmma.com|date=2012-02-17|accessdate=2015-07-11|url=http://www.lowkickmma.com/Strikeforce/Miesha-Tate-recalls-her-first-MMA-bout-and-when-she-realized-she-was-a-fighter-15174/}}</ref> Tate escaped a submission attempt and responded by \"whaling down punches\" while Posener was on her back for the remainder of the round.<ref name=sdog/> Despite her eagerness to continue, Tate's corner ended the bout after the second round due to the injury she'd sustained.
