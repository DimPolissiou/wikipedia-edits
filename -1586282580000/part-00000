Here the function is {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} (''x''<sup>3</sup> + 3''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 6''x'' \u2212 8)/4}}.]]\n\nIn my peeper long, [[mathematics]], a '''cubic function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form\n:<math>f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math>\nwhere the coefficients {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, and {{mvar|d}} are [[real number]]s, and the variable {{mvar|x}} takes real values, and  {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}. In other words, it is both a [[polynomial function]] of degree three, and a [[real function]]. In particular, the [[domain of a function|domain]] and the [[codomain]] are the set of the real numbers.\n\nSetting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} produces a [[cubic equation]] of the form\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,</math>\nwhose solutions are called [[root of a function|roots]] of the function. \n\nA cubic function has either one or three real roots (the existence of at least one real root is true for all odd-degree polynomial functions).\n\nThe [[graph of a function|graph]] of a cubic function always has a single [[inflection point]]. It may have two [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]], a local minimum and a local maximum. Otherwise, a cubic function is [[monotonic]]. The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point; that is, it is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around this point. [[Up to]] an [[affine transformation]], there are only three possible graphs for cubic functions.\n\nCubic functions are fundamental for [[cubic interpolation]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Cubic equation#History}}\n\n==Critical and inflection points==\n{{Cubic_graph_special_points.svg}}\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a cubic function are its [[stationary point]]s, that is the points where the slope of the function is zero. Thus the critical points of a cubic function {{math|''f''}} defined by \n:{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d''}}, \noccur at values of {{math|''x''}} such that the [[derivative]]\n:<math> 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0</math>\nof the cubic function is zero.\n\nThe solutions of this equation are the {{mvar|x}}-values of the critical points and are given, using the [[quadratic formula]], by <!-- Do not change 3ac into 4ac: here the of the cubic equation coefficients of the quadratic polynomial are not the same as the coefficients generally used for expressing the quadratic formula -->\n:<math>x_\\text{critical}=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-3ac}}{3a}.</math>\n\nThe sign of the expression inside the square root determines the number of critical points. If it is positive, then there are two critical points, one is a local maximum, and the other is a local minimum. If {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2013 3''ac'' {{=}} 0}}, then there is only one critical point, which is an [[inflection point]]. If {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2013 3''ac'' < 0}}, then there are no (real) critical points. In the two latter cases, that is, if {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2013 3''ac''}} is nonpositive, the cubic function is strictly [[monotonic]]. See the figure for an example of the case {{math|\u0394<sub>0</sub> > 0}}.\n\nThe inflection point of a function is where that function changes [[concavity]]. An inflection point occurs when the [[second derivative]] is zero, and the third derivative is nonzero. Thus a cubic function has always a single inflection point, which occurs at\n:<math>x_\\text{inflection} = -\\frac{b}{3a}.</math>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Cubic function (different c).svg|thumb|Cubic functions of the form <math>y=x^3+px.</math><br/>The graph of any cubic function is [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] to such a curve.]]\n\nThe [[graph of a function|graph]] of a cubic function is an example of a [[cubic curve]]. (Many cubic curves are not graphs of functions.) \n\nAlthough cubic functions depend on four parameters, their graph can have only very few shapes. In fact, the graph of a cubic function is always [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] to the graph of a function of the form\n:<math>y=x^3+px.</math> \nThis similarity can be built as the composition of [[translation]]s parallel to the coordinates axes, a [[homothecy]] ([[uniform scaling]]), and, possibly, a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] ([[mirror image]]) with respect to the {{mvar|y}}-axis. A further [[uniform scaling|non-uniform scaling]] can transform the graph into the graph of one among the three cubic functions\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny&=x^3+x\\\\\ny&=x^3\\\\\ny&=x^3-x.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis means that there are only three graphs of cubic functions [[up to]] an [[affine transformation]].\n\nThe above [[geometric transformation]]s can be built in the following way, when starting from a general cubic function \n<math>y=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d.</math>\n\nFirstly, if {{math|''a'' < 0}}, the [[change of variable]] {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u2013''x''}} allows supposing {{math|''a'' > 0}}. After this change of variable, the new graph is the mirror image of the previous one, with respect of the {{mvar|y}}-axis.\n\nThen, the change of variable {{math|1=''x'' = ''x''{{sub|1}} \u2013 {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}} provides a function of the form\n:<math>y=ax_1^3+px+q.</math>\nThis corresponds to a translation parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis.\n\nThe change of variable {{math|1=''y'' = ''y''{{sub|1}} + ''q''}} corresponds to a translation with respect to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, and gives a function of the form\n:<math>y_1=ax_1^3+px.</math>\n\nThe change of variable <math>\\textstyle x_1=\\frac {x_2}\\sqrt a, y_1=\\frac {y_2}\\sqrt a</math> corresponds to a uniform scaling, and give, after division by <math>\\sqrt a,</math> a function of the form \n:<math>y_2=x_2^3+px,</math>\nwhich is the simplest form that can be obtained by a similarity.\n\nThen, if {{math|''p'' \u2260 0}}, the non-uniform scaling <math>\\textstyle x_2=x_3\\sqrt{|p|},\\quad y_2=y_3\\sqrt{|p|^3}</math> gives, after division by <math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{|p|^3},</math>\n:<math>y_3 =x_3 + x\\operatorname{sign}(p),</math>\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{sign}(p)</math> has the value 1 or \u20131, depending on the sign of {{mvar|p}}. If one defines <math>\\operatorname{sign}(0)=0,</math> the latter form of the function applies to all cases.\n\n==Symmetry==\nFor a cubic function of the form <math>y=x^3+px,</math> the inflection point is thus the origin. As such a function is an [[odd function]], its graph is symmetric with respect to the inflection point, and invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point. As these properties are invariant by [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]], the following is true for all cubic functions. \n\n''The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point, and is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point.''\n\n==Collinearities==\n[[File:Cubica colinear.png|thumb|The points {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''P''<sub>3</sub>}} (in blue) are collinear and belong to the graph of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + {{sfrac|3|2}}''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 {{sfrac|5|2}}''x'' + {{sfrac|5|4}}}}.

For purposes of modern performances, the editions and completions available are those by Alois Schmitt (1901, Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel), [[H. C.

For the Credo this means a completions of the \u2018Credo in unum Deum\u2019 and the \u2018Et incarnatus est\u2019 and additional music for the rest of the Credo. This edition, therefore, is intended to be used in combination with any other version of the Mass.\n[[Robert Xavier Rodriguez]] has also completed the Agnus Dei.<ref>[http://www.schirmer.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2420&State_2874=2&workId_2874=35027# \"Robert Xavier Rodr\u00edguez: Agnus Dei (completion of Mozart's Mass in C minor)], [[G.

Studied by [[glaciologist]]s, the temporal coincidence of [[glacier]] retreat with the measured increase of atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es is often cited as an evidentiary underpinning of [[global warming]].  Mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the [[Himalayas]], [[Alps]], [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]], and the southern [[Andes]], as well as isolated tropical summits such as [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, are showing some of the largest proportionate glacial losses.<ref>{{cite web|author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|title=Graph of 20 glaciers in retreat worldwide|work=Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis)|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-18.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2015|author-link=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas M\u00f6lg|title=Worldwide glacier retreat|work=RealClimate|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=129|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Glacier mass balance]] is the key determinant of the health of a glacier.  If the amount of frozen precipitation in the [[accumulation zone]] exceeds the quantity of glacial ice lost due to melting or in the [[ablation zone]] a glacier will advance; if the accumulation is less than the ablation, the glacier will retreat.  Glaciers in retreat will have negative mass balances, and if they do not find an equilibrium between accumulation and ablation, will eventually disappear.\n\nThe [[Little Ice Age]] was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when the world experienced relatively cooler temperatures compared to the time before and after.  Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed substantially.  Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed temporarily, in many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as global temperatures [[:File:Global monthly temperature record.png|cooled slightly]].<ref name=pelto1>{{cite web|last=Pelto|first=Mauri|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>  Since 1980, a significant [[global warming]] has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether, and the existences of many of the remaining glaciers are threatened.

Since higher elevations are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of a significant portion of the accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and/or an increase in frozen precipitation.<ref name=hubbard>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Bryn|author2=Neil F.

Thirdly, few taller mountains exist in these regions upon which enough cold air exists for the establishment of glaciers.

In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melting glaciers threaten Peru|date=October 9, 2003|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3172572.stm}}</ref> [[Central Asian]] countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the [[Pacific Northwest]] of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.\n\nSome of this retreat has resulted in efforts to slow down the loss of glaciers in the Alps.

Research also indicates that the glacial retreat was proportionately greater in the 1990s than in any other decade over the last 100 years. [[Gannett Glacier]] on the northeast slope of [[Gannett Peak]] is the largest single glacier in the [[Rocky Mountains]] south of Canada.

In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melting glaciers threaten Peru|date=October 9, 2003|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3172572.stm}}</ref> [[Central Asian]] countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies.

Although previously it was thought that the polar ice caps were not contributing heavily to sea level rise (IPCC 2007), recent studies have confirmed that both Antarctica and Greenland are contributing {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} a year each to global sea level rise.<ref name=\"pmid17272686\">{{cite journal |author=Rahmstorf S, Cazenave A, Church JA |title=Recent climate observations compared to projections |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5825 |page=709 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17272686 |doi=10.1126/science.1136843 |url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fc23d1a992a4750ac0c7e3a2c3049c772db302f1|bibcode=2007Sci...316..709R |displayauthors=1 |last2=Church |last3=Hansen |last4=Keeling |last5=Parker |last6=Somerville }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Velicogna | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1029/2009GL040222 | title = Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = 19 | pages = L19503 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GeoRL..3619503V | citeseerx = 10.1.1.170.8753 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cazenave | first1 = A. | last2 = Dominh | first2 = K. | last3 = Guinehut | first3 = S. | last4 = Berthier | first4 = E. | last5 = Llovel | first5 = W. | last6 = Ramillien | first6 = G. | last7 = Ablain | first7 = M. | last8 = Larnicol | first8 = G. | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.10.004 | title = Sea level budget over 2003\u20132008: A reevaluation from GRACE space gravimetry, satellite altimetry and Argo | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 83\u201388 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GPC....65...83C | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00401223/document }}</ref>  The [[Thwaites Glacier]] alone, in Western Antarctica is \"currently responsible for approximately 4 percent of global sea level rise.

It is loosely related to the term ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was later used to describe the geopolitical containment of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1940s. The strategy of \"containment\" is best known as a [[Cold War]] [[foreign policy of the United States]] and its allies to prevent the spread of [[communism]] after the end of [[World War II]].\n\nAs a component of the Cold War, this [[foreign policy|policy]] was a response to the Soviet Union's move to increase communist influence in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. Containment represented a middle-ground position between [[detente]] (relaxation of relations) and [[rollback]] (actively replacing a regime).\nThe basis of the [[doctrine]] was articulated in a [[Long Telegram|1946 cable]] by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] during the post-WWII term of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. As a description of [[U.S. foreign policy]], the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1947, which was later used in a magazine article.\n\n==Earlier uses of term==\nThere were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a [[free soil]] strategy of containment to stop the expansion of the coronavirus until it later collapsed. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy of staying at home and doing homework all day long. \n<blockquote>The Federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12|isbn=9780393065312}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.<ref>James Stone, \"Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873\u20131877,\" ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281\u2013304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240  online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214134224/http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 |date=2014-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] called for a ''cordon sanitaire'', a ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating that phrase, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for a \"quarantine.\" Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease.\n\nThe [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|World War I Allies launched an incursion into Russia]], ostensibly to create an eastern front against Germany. In reality, the policy was anti-Bolshevik as well, and its economic warfare took a major toll on all of Russia. By 1919, the intervention was entirely anti-communist, although the unpopularity of the assault led it to be gradually withdrawn. The US simultaneously engaged in covert action against the new Soviet government, involving the work of a young [[Allen Dulles]]. While the campaigns were officially pro-democracy, they often supported the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]] of former Tsarist generals like [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|GM Semenov]] and [[Alexander Kolchak]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Carley|first=Michael J.|title=Review of Foglesong, David S., America's Secret War Against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|date=June 1996|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=489|publisher=H-Russia, H-Review|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ppojDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=David+S.+Foglesong,+containment#v=onepage&q=David%20S.%20Foglesong,%20containment&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] reversed the policy in 1933 in the hope to expand American export markets.\n\nThe [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 was a failed attempt to contain Nazi expansion in Europe. The U.S. tried to contain Japanese expansion in Asia in 1937 to 1941, and Japan reacted with its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Sidney Pash, \"Containment, Rollback and the Onset of the Pacific War, 1933-1941\" in G.

[[Averell Harriman]], U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, once a \"confirmed optimist\" regarding U.S.-Soviet relations,<ref name=\"Larson69\">Larson, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment: A Psychological Explanation'', p. 69.</ref> was disillusioned by what he saw as the Soviet betrayal of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]] as well as by violations of the February 1945 [[Yalta Agreement]] concerning [[Poland]].<ref name=\"Larson116\">Larson, p. 116.</ref> Harriman would later have a significant influence in forming Truman's views on the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Larson68\">Larson, p.68.</ref>\n\nIn February 1946, the U.S. State Department asked [[George F.

Kennan, ''Memoirs 1925-1950'' P. 359</ref>\n\n==Harry S. Truman (1884 \u2013 1972)==\n\nAfter Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting Communist subversion.<ref name=\"Truman\">[[s:Truman Doctrine|President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress]], March 12, 1947.</ref> Truman pledged to, \"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"<ref name=\"Truman\"/> This pledge became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between \"totalitarian regimes\" and \"free peoples,\" the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.\n\nTruman's motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of [[Herbert Feis]], a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945\u201347 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded.<ref name=\"Larson9\">Larsen, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment'', p. 9.</ref> In the revisionist view of [[William Appleman Williams]], Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.<ref name=\"Larson9\"/> In the [[realpolitik]] view of [[Lynn E. Davis]], Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.<ref name=\"Larson15\">Larson, p. 15.</ref>\n\nAccording to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Larson147\">Larson, p. 147.</ref> \"I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them,\" he once said.<ref name=\"Larson145-46\">Larson, pp 145-46.</ref>\n\nThe drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.<ref name=\"Larson302\">Larson, p. 302.</ref> Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.<ref name=\"LarsonXI\">Larson, p. xi., p. 303</ref>\n\nThe British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.<ref>Lawrence S. Wittner, ''American Intervention in Greece, 1943-1949'' (1982)</ref> Undersecretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in Washington, warning congressional leaders in late February 1947 that if the United States did not take over from the British, the result most probably would be a \"Soviet breakthrough\" that \"might open three continents to Soviet penetration.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Dean Acheson|title=Present at the creation: my years in the State Department|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirSz3Wtaa0C&pg=PA219|year=1987|publisher=W W Norton|page=219|isbn=9780393304121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Chace|authorlink=James Chace|title=Acheson: The Secretary Of State Who Created The American World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Jf32GR7t3IC&pg=PA166|year=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=166\u201367|isbn=9780684864822}}</ref> Truman was explicit about the challenge of Communism taking control of Greece. He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, notably by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.<ref>John M. Schuessler, \"Absorbing The First Blow: Truman And The Cold War,\" ''White House Studies'' (2009) 9#3 pp 215-231.</ref>\n\nTruman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the [[Marshall Plan]], or European Recovery Program, and [[NATO]], a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as [[NSC 68]].<ref>Efstathios T. Fakiolas, \"Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68: A Comparative Theoretical Analysis,\" ''East European Quarterly'' (1997) 31#4 pp 415-433.</ref>  It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by [[Paul Nitze]] and others:\n\n{{quote|In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) \"The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief.\" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives.

The first was a return to [[isolationism]], minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the [[Midwest]], including former President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&pg=PA631|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=631|author-link=David McCullough|isbn=9780743260299}}</ref>\n\nThe second policy was continuation of the [[d\u00e9tente]] policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of d\u00e9tente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of d\u00e9tente was Henry  Wallace, a former vice president and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit d\u00e9tente.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jerel A.

Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by [[James Burnham]]<ref>Daniel Kelly, ''James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life'' (2002) p. 155</ref> and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]'' magazine.\n\nTruman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the [[Korean War]] after the success of the [[Inchon]] landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese [[counterattack]] two months later and revert to containment. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.<ref>James I.

Initially, this directed the action of the US to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty, thereby allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the U.S. and the [[United Nations]] to adopt a [[rollback]] strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.<ref>James I.

The Communists were later pushed back to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Truman criticized MacArthur's focus on absolute victory and adopted a \"[[limited war]]\" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman's \"no-win policy.\"<ref>[[Safire, William]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC Safire's Political Dictionary]'', p. 531.</ref>\n\n==Dulles==\n\nMany Republicans, including [[John Foster Dulles]], were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"StateDept\">\"[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/17601.htm Kennan and Containment, 1947]\", ''Diplomacy in Action,'' U.S. Department of State,</ref> Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Eisenhower, but Eisenhower's decision not to intervene during the 1956 Hungarian Uprising made containment a bipartisan doctrine.

There was fear of a [[nuclear war]] until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued until 2015.<ref>Alice L. George, ''The Cuban missile crisis: The threshold of nuclear war'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==Vietnam==\nSenator [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, \"Why not victory?\"<ref>[[Richard J. Jensen]], Jon Thares Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'', p. 178. (2003)</ref> President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war.

The quote is from [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:11.</ref> Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the [[Vietnam War]]. Rejecting proposals by General [[William Westmoreland]] for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called [[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.\n\nRallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.<ref name=\"Jensen1\"/> Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.<ref>Jensen, p. 182.</ref>\n\nNixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as d\u00e9tente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called [[Vietnamization]]. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized [[human right]]s. However, in response to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]], containment was again made a priority. The wording of the [[Carter Doctrine]] (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.\n\n==Reagan Doctrine==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nFollowing the communist victory of Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. [[Ronald Reagan]], a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected US President in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that d\u00e9tente was misguided and [[peaceful coexistence]] was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army ([[Mujahideen]]).<ref>Olson, James Stuart. Historical dictionary of the 1950s. Westport, Conn: Greenwood P, 2000.</ref>\n\nBy sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, Reagan confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the [[Pershing II]] missile in Europe and promoted research on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], called \"Star Wars\" by its critics, to shoot down missiles fired at the United States.\n\nReagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called [[START I]] and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.\n\n==After Cold War==\nThe [[history of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|end of the Cold War]] in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also, much of the policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the [[War on Terror]] and dealing with post-Cold War dictators, such as [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeasement]]\n* [[Domino theory]]\n* [[D\u00e9tente]]\n* [[Marshall Plan]]\n* [[Rollback]]\n* [[Truman Doctrine]]\n* [[Dual containment]] (Iran-Iraq containment)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* Corke, Sarah-Jane. \"History, historians and the Naming of Foreign Policy: A Postmodern Reflection on American Strategic thinking during the Truman Administration,\" ''Intelligence and National Security,'' Autumn 2001, Vol. 16 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;146\u201363.\n* Felix, David.

It is loosely related to the term ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was later used to describe the geopolitical containment of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1940s. The strategy of \"containment\" is best known as a [[Cold War]] [[foreign policy of the United States]] and its allies to prevent the spread of [[communism]] after the end of [[World War II]].\n\nAs a component of the Cold War, this [[foreign policy|policy]] was a response to the Soviet Union's move to increase communist influence in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. Containment represented a middle-ground position between [[detente]] (relaxation of relations) and [[rollback]] (actively replacing a regime).\nThe basis of the [[doctrine]] was articulated in a [[Long Telegram|1946 cable]] by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] during the post-WWII term of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. As a description of [[U.S. foreign policy]], the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1947, which was later used in a magazine article.\n\n==Earlier uses of term==\nThere were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a [[free soil]] strategy of containment to stop the expansion of slavery until it later collapsed. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:\n<blockquote>The Federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12|isbn=9780393065312}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.<ref>James Stone, \"Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873\u20131877,\" ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281\u2013304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240  online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214134224/http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 |date=2014-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] called for a ''cordon sanitaire'', a ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating that phrase, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for a \"quarantine.\" Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease.\n\nThe [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|World War I Allies launched an incursion into Russia]], ostensibly to create an eastern front against Germany. In reality, the policy was anti-Bolshevik as well, and its economic warfare took a major toll on all of Russia. By 1919, the intervention was entirely anti-communist, although the unpopularity of the assault led it to be gradually withdrawn. The US simultaneously engaged in covert action against the new Soviet government, involving the work of a young [[Allen Dulles]]. While the campaigns were officially pro-democracy, they often supported the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]] of former Tsarist generals like [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|GM Semenov]] and [[Alexander Kolchak]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Carley|first=Michael J.|title=Review of Foglesong, David S., America's Secret War Against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|date=June 1996|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=489|publisher=H-Russia, H-Review|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ppojDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=David+S.+Foglesong,+containment#v=onepage&q=David%20S.%20Foglesong,%20containment&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President [[Franklin D.

The U.S. tried to contain Japanese expansion in Asia in 1937 to 1941, and Japan reacted with its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Sidney Pash, \"Containment, Rollback and the Onset of the Pacific War, 1933-1941\" in G.

Truman (1884 \u2013 1972)==\n\nAfter Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting Communist subversion.<ref name=\"Truman\">[[s:Truman Doctrine|President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress]], March 12, 1947.</ref> Truman pledged to, \"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"<ref name=\"Truman\"/> This pledge became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between \"totalitarian regimes\" and \"free peoples,\" the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.\n\nTruman's motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of [[Herbert Feis]], a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945\u201347 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded.<ref name=\"Larson9\">Larsen, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment'', p. 9.</ref> In the revisionist view of [[William Appleman Williams]], Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.<ref name=\"Larson9\"/> In the [[realpolitik]] view of [[Lynn E. Davis]], Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.<ref name=\"Larson15\">Larson, p. 15.</ref>\n\nAccording to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Larson147\">Larson, p. 147.</ref> \"I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them,\" he once said.<ref name=\"Larson145-46\">Larson, pp 145-46.</ref>\n\nThe drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.<ref name=\"Larson302\">Larson, p. 302.</ref> Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.<ref name=\"LarsonXI\">Larson, p. xi., p. 303</ref>\n\nThe British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.<ref>Lawrence S.

He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, notably by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.<ref>John M. Schuessler, \"Absorbing The First Blow: Truman And The Cold War,\" ''White House Studies'' (2009) 9#3 pp 215-231.</ref>\n\nTruman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the [[Marshall Plan]], or European Recovery Program, and [[NATO]], a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as [[NSC 68]].<ref>Efstathios T. Fakiolas, \"Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68: A Comparative Theoretical Analysis,\" ''East European Quarterly'' (1997) 31#4 pp 415-433.</ref>  It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by [[Paul Nitze]] and others:\n\n{{quote|In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) \"The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief.\" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war.<ref name=\"Nitze\">''[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-4.htm NSC 68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security]''</ref>}}\n\n==Alternative strategies==\nThere were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to [[isolationism]], minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the [[Midwest]], including former President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&pg=PA631|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=631|author-link=David McCullough|isbn=9780743260299}}</ref>\n\nThe second policy was continuation of the [[d\u00e9tente]] policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of d\u00e9tente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of d\u00e9tente was Henry  Wallace, a former vice president and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit d\u00e9tente.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jerel A.

Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by [[James Burnham]]<ref>Daniel Kelly, ''James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life'' (2002) p. 155</ref> and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]'' magazine.\n\nTruman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the [[Korean War]] after the success of the [[Inchon]] landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese [[counterattack]] two months later and revert to containment. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.<ref>James I.

Initially, this directed the action of the US to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty, thereby allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the U.S. and the [[United Nations]] to adopt a [[rollback]] strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.<ref>James I.

The Chinese, fearful of a possible US presence on their border or even an invasion by them, then sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them back below the 38th parallel.

The Communists were later pushed back to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Truman criticized MacArthur's focus on absolute victory and adopted a \"[[limited war]]\" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman's \"no-win policy.\"<ref>[[Safire, William]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC Safire's Political Dictionary]'', p. 531.</ref>\n\n==Dulles==\n\nMany Republicans, including [[John Foster Dulles]], were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"StateDept\">\"[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/17601.htm Kennan and Containment, 1947]\", ''Diplomacy in Action,'' U.S. Department of State,</ref> Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Eisenhower, but Eisenhower's decision not to intervene during the 1956 Hungarian Uprising made containment a bipartisan doctrine. Eisenhower relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War.<ref>John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA,''  (2009)</ref>\n\n==Cuba==\nIn the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, the top officials in Washington debated using rollback to get rid of Soviet nuclear missiles, which were threatening the United States. There was fear of a [[nuclear war]] until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued until 2015.<ref>Alice L. George, ''The Cuban missile crisis: The threshold of nuclear war'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==Vietnam==\nSenator [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, \"Why not victory?\"<ref>[[Richard J. Jensen]], Jon Thares Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'', p. 178. (2003)</ref> President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war. Johnson explained containment doctrine by quoting the Bible: \"Hitherto shalt thou come, but not further.\"<ref name=\"Jensen1\">Jensen, p. 180. The quote is from [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:11.</ref> Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the [[Vietnam War]]. Rejecting proposals by General [[William Westmoreland]] for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called [[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.\n\nRallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.<ref name=\"Jensen1\"/> Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.<ref>Jensen, p. 182.</ref>\n\nNixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as d\u00e9tente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called [[Vietnamization]]. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized [[human right]]s. However, in response to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]], containment was again made a priority. The wording of the [[Carter Doctrine]] (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.\n\n==Reagan Doctrine==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nFollowing the communist victory of Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. [[Ronald Reagan]], a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected US President in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that d\u00e9tente was misguided and [[peaceful coexistence]] was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army ([[Mujahideen]]).<ref>Olson, James Stuart. Historical dictionary of the 1950s. Westport, Conn: Greenwood P, 2000.</ref>\n\nBy sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, Reagan confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the [[Pershing II]] missile in Europe and promoted research on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], called \"Star Wars\" by its critics, to shoot down missiles fired at the United States.\n\nReagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called [[START I]] and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.\n\n==After Cold War==\nThe [[history of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|end of the Cold War]] in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also, much of the policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the [[War on Terror]] and dealing with post-Cold War dictators, such as [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeasement]]\n* [[Domino theory]]\n* [[D\u00e9tente]]\n* [[Marshall Plan]]\n* [[Rollback]]\n* [[Truman Doctrine]]\n* [[Dual containment]] (Iran-Iraq containment)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* Corke, Sarah-Jane. \"History, historians and the Naming of Foreign Policy: A Postmodern Reflection on American Strategic thinking during the Truman Administration,\" ''Intelligence and National Security,'' Autumn 2001, Vol. 16 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;146\u201363.\n* Felix, David.

He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar.{{ref label|id ref2a|note|Note}}<ref name=tx/> He described himself as \"eighty years of age\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \"80\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe information known about Guam\u00e1n Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Crist\u00f3bal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Mur\u00faa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.\n\nBased on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P.

This image is entitled \"The Mercedarian friar Mart\u00edn de Mur\u00faa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands.\" According to Rolena Adorno, \"...when he became an author, after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Mur\u00faa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Mur\u00faa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in [the original manuscript of ''Historia general del Piru''].\n\nGuaman Poma wrote about Andean history back to the era predating the Inca. He also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society, unique among other manuscripts of the era. Guaman Poma's artistic range, displayed in his nearly 400 drawings, was based on his experience gained while working with Mur\u00faa, but it also developed in new directions.  He revealed a strong polemical and satirical bent that he directed against colonial abuses. \"Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Mur\u00faa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru.\"<ref>Adorno and Boserup, pp. 7\u201375</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nGuaman's name means \"Falcon\" or \"Aguila\" when translated into English and Spanish respectively.

He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar.{{ref label|id ref2a|note|Note}}<ref name=tx/> He described himself as \"eighty years of age\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \"80\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe information known about Guam\u00e1n Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Crist\u00f3bal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Mur\u00faa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.\n\nBased on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, \"Peru before the Incas\", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000\u20131476 CE, known as the \"Late Intermediate\", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires.\n\nThe Huaman Family, per stirpes,{{explain|date=December 2017}} belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after.

This image is entitled \"The Mercedarian friar Mart\u00edn de Mur\u00faa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands.\" According to Rolena Adorno, \"...when he became an author, after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Mur\u00faa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Mur\u00faa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in [the original manuscript of ''Historia general del Piru''].\n\nGuaman Poma wrote about Andean history back to the era predating the Inca. He also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society, unique among other manuscripts of the era. Guaman Poma's artistic range, displayed in his nearly 400 drawings, was based on his experience gained while working with Mur\u00faa, but it also developed in new directions.  He revealed a strong polemical and satirical bent that he directed against colonial abuses. \"Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Mur\u00faa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru.\"<ref>Adorno and Boserup, pp. 7\u201375</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nGuaman's name means \"Falcon\" or \"Aguila\" when translated into English and Spanish respectively. At the time, a Falcon, had the meaning of a representation of a \"Supreme Existence\". Someone, with the \"designation\" of a \"Falcon\" had the highest regards within the Inca and predesecing cultures. Poma's name meant \"Puma\" in Quechua dialect.<ref>Boone, Elizabeth Hill Boone and Tom Cummins.

Other variants include Waman Poma, Huam\u00e1n Poma, and Guam\u00e1n Poma (the latter two with a Spanish accent; the Quechua stress is on the first syllable). In his own writing, he signed with his Quechua name put between his Spanish baptismal name, Felipe (or Phelipe, as he spelled it<ref>Adorno, xii</ref>) and the family name of a Spanish [[conquistador]] connected to his family history, Luis \u00c1valos de Ayala.<ref>Adorno, 17</ref> Guaman Poma writes about the symbolism of all his names in his book.  He seemed to consider the form of his name as a statement that his Quechua identity remained his core, although it was surrounded by Spanish names.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fray Mart\u00edn de Mur\u00faa]]\n* [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]]\n* [[Taki Unquy]]\n* [[Augusto Huaman Velasco]]\n* [[Huaman]]\n* [[Blas Valera]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{note label|id ref2a|note|Note|False assertion since the official Spanish orthography of those centuries was different from the current one, his manuscripts are written in perfect Spanish but that differs in the orthography in the cases as (v) instead of all the (u); (u) instead of all the (v); (z) instead of all the (c); (y) instead of (i) if it is the first letter of the word; (rr) instead of (r) if it is the first letter of the word; and other few similar cases; same it happens in all the Spanish-language documents of the most of the early modern era.}}\n\nWithout seeing the actual text, it is difficult to make any definite statements in this regard.

The school was developed as a cooperative effort between OIC of America, a non-profit organization, designated to serve the community with the mantra of \"Helping people help themselves\", (founded by the late Rev. Leon Sullivan) and the School District of Philadelphia. The school provides transitional services both academic and developmental to a myriad of students of diverse backgrounds, with many being from low income and underserved communities. CADI services students ages 17\u201321, who have been absent from traditional high school for at least six months.\n\nThe Career and Academic Development Institute's curriculum is parallel with the school district of Philadelphia's high school standards of learning.  CADI was uniquely designed to assist students by providing several different program options that may fit students scheduling needs, which include year-round sessions during the day.

The school was developed as a cooperative effort between OIC of America, a non-profit organization, designated to serve the community with the mantra of \"Helping people help themselves\", (founded by the late Rev. Leon Sullivan) and the School District of Philadelphia. The school provides transitional services both academic and developmental to a myriad of students of diverse backgrounds, with many being from low income and underserved communities. CADI services students ages 17\u201321, who have been absent from traditional high school for at least six months.\n\nThe Career and Academic Development Institute\u2019s curriculum is parallel with the school district of Philadelphia\u2019s high school standards of learning.  CADI was uniquely designed to assist students by providing several different program options that may fit students scheduling needs, which include year-round sessions during the day.

In 1958, I-84 was co-signed with Route 15 north and east of East Hartford, Connecticut, into Massachusetts.\n\nIn late 1968, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) approved a new Interstate connection from Hartford to Providence, which was to become part of a rerouted I-84. As a result, the existing section of I-84 from Manchester, Connecticut, to I-90 (overlapping Route 15) was redesignated [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)#I-86 relation|I-86]].\n\nShortly thereafter, MassDPW embarked on a reconstruction of its portion of the highway with new and reconstructed carriageways providing three {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} lanes and standard shoulders. Both carriageways were separated by a wide, forested variable median. New bridges, interchanges and weigh stations were erected along the route. The $20 million reconstruction project was completed in 1973. (Similar improvements in Connecticut were not completed until the 1980s.)\n\nOn October 1, 1980, the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] decided to truncate Route 15 back to I-84 exit 57 (where it ends today), eliminating the overlap with I-86. Simultaneously, Massachusetts eliminated the overlap by decommissioning its Route 15 entirely.\n\n===Redesignation===\nWhen the planned portion of I-84 toward Providence ran into opposition in Rhode Island and was cancelled in 1983, I-86 was officially reverted to I-84.  The I-86 numbering was officially deleted on December 12, 1984.

In 1958, I-84 was co-signed with Route 15 north and east of East Hartford, Connecticut, into Massachusetts.\n\nIn late 1968, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) approved a new Interstate connection from Hartford to Providence, which was to become part of a rerouted I-84. As a result, the existing section of I-84 from Manchester, Connecticut, to I-90 (overlapping Route 15) was redesignated [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)#I-86 relation|I-86]].\n\nShortly thereafter, MassDPW embarked on a reconstruction of its portion of the highway with new and reconstructed carriageways providing three {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} lanes and standard shoulders. Both carriageways were separated by a wide, forested variable median. New bridges, interchanges and weigh stations were erected along the route. The $20 million reconstruction project was completed in 1973. (Similar improvements in Connecticut were not completed until the 1980s.)\n\nOn October 1, 1980, the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] decided to truncate Route 15 back to I-84 exit 57 (where it ends today), eliminating the overlap with I-86. Simultaneously, Massachusetts eliminated the overlap by decommissioning its Route 15 entirely.\n\n===Redesignation===\nWhen the planned portion of I-84 toward Providence ran into opposition in Rhode Island and was cancelled in 1983, I-86 was officially reverted to I-84.  The I-86 numbering was officially deleted on December 12, 1984. Plans to connect I-84 along the present day [[Interstate 384|I-384]]/[[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] corridor from Hartford to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] were scuttled for environmental reasons.

During the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], Ba\u010d became not only the ecclesiastical seat of the Archdiocese, but a royal city, where nobles and rulers came to their councils and assemblies. In the twelfth century Ba\u010d fortress is first mentioned in written sources.\n\nAt the head of Ba\u010dka county there were governors appointed by the king. Until the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Mongol invasion]] in 1241, the governors were the managers of the area. They collected donations, set up military and civilian commanders. In addition to the governors of the fort there were also lower prefects, judges, and military personnel. Since the twelfth century, the custom of annual royal visits to the fort was established.\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century a dynasty change occurred in the Kingdom of Hungary. and the town prospered during the rule of king Charles Robert I, who  started building the modern fortress in 1338\u201342.<ref name=novi>{{cite news | author = Marija \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 | title = \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0411\u0430\u0447\u0430 | trans-title = New life for the ramparts of Ba\u010d (interview with Slavica Vujovi\u0107, head of the fortress' conservation team) | newspaper = Politika | page = 07 | language = Serbian | date = 16 June 2018}}</ref> The new town (fortress) on Mostonga had the quadrangular tower with six floors, important for the defense of the city. Originally there were 8 towers, various chambers of the county manager, a chapel, guard towers, kitchen, water well, barn, and various other premises, the remains of which stand today.\n\nThe fort and the town developed as Ba\u010d was the major crossroad at the time. Roads from and to Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean all crossed here, and the tall central tower allowed the overseeing and control of the lowlands and both the river and the land traffic.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThough the construction began in the first half of the 14th century, which is the base of what survived until today, the complex was shaped in the present way by the 15th century and reached its full extension by the 16th century. Archbishop {{ill|P\u00e9ter V\u00e1radi|hu|V\u00e1radi P\u00e9ter}} expanded and embellished the fortress and also dredged the Mostonga so that ships from the Danube were able to reach the fort.<ref name=novi/>\n\nFrom the 15th century, it was the most important Hungarian defense point against the invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman forces]]. The pivotal moment was the disastrous Hungarian defeat in 1526 at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], so the Ottomans conquered Ba\u010d in 1529.<ref name=Politika/> During the war between Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, in the 16th century, Serbian despot [[Stevan Berislavi\u0107]] successfully defended the Ba\u010d fortress from the Ottomans for a long time until the fortress finally fell.\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs from 1526, the city and fort became an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] possession.<ref name=edu>{{cite web|title=Ba\u010d Fortress (Ba\u010dka tvr\u0111ava) -- ruins|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/handle/1811/39680|publisher=kb.osu.edu|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (16th-17th century), Ba\u010d was the seat of the [[Kaza]] of Ba\u010d, as part of the [[Sanjak of Segedin]]. Dating from this period are also the descriptions of Ba\u010d Fortress by the Ottoman traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]]. According to his description, the city was surrounded by a wide circle of trenches filled with water. Surrounding the city was also a developing civilian settlement, which could be entered through the fortress drawbridge gate, named the \"Spike\".\n\n=== Later period ===\n\nSince 1686 the town was under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]. The fortress was mined with explosives in 1704, during the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]] (1703\u201311),<ref name=Politika/> and was subsequently abandoned as it was left burned, demolished, and without the previous military importance it had.<ref name=novi/> However, Ba\u010d fortress still remains the best preserved medieval fortress in [[Vojvodina]].<ref name=\"virtu\"/>\n\nAfter 1918, Ba\u010d was part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and subsequent [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] states. It was occupied by [[Hungary]] between 1941\u20131944, during [[World War II]].\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe medieval fortress in Ba\u010d is known as one of the great fortresses of its time in the Pannonian plain.<ref name=sek>{{cite web|title=Bac |url=http://www.sekcijatvrdjava.org/en/fortresses/bac.html |publisher=www.sekcijatvrdjava.org |accessdate=13 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301192324/http://www.sekcijatvrdjava.org/en/fortresses/bac.html |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> It was built by the town of the same name to the west, on a small island on the river [[Mostonga]]. The Fortress in Ba\u010d is known as one of the so-called \"water towns\", because it used to be surrounded by the Mostonga river on all sides, approachable only by the [[drawbridge]]s.<ref name=un>{{cite web|title=Historical place of Ba\u010d and its Surroundings|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5540/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> It also meant that it was adapted for defense in the lowland and marshy areas.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe ruins of the fortress in its present state, consist of a base in the form of an irregular pentagon (\"[[trapezoid]]\").<ref name=novi/> The fort used to have 8 towers, but five are preserved today. There are four lateral towers while the fifth is the {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} tall [[keep]] (''don\u017eon'').<ref name=Politika/> The trapezoidal base covers {{convert|5,600|m2|abbr=on}}, while the entire plateau on which the tower complex is located has {{convert|8,700|m2|abbr=on}}. The ramparts which connect the towers are massive. Three corner twoers have round base and are open towards the interior of the fort. The northwest tower and the one with the main gate have a square base.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe most fortified was the eastern side, which included the {{ill|''brani\u010d''|sr|Brani\u010d kula}} tower, the keep, residential palace, palace for the knights, water well, [[cistern]] and food storages. On the inside, several objects, of different purpose, directly leaned onto the rampart walls. The materials used for the construction is mostly brickm, while the stone and [[terracotta]] were used for the ornaments.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe Section of Ba\u010d below the fortress is called ''Podgra\u0111e''. It consists of 36 houses in the typical lowland Vojvodina style and is protected, together with the fort, as the [[Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance]]. The section is directly accessed via the bridge across the canal and through the gate, which is still being called the \"Spike\" (''\u0160iljak''). The houses were built from the 18th to the 20th century, and residents are not allowed to change fa\u00e7ades without prior consent from the institutes in charge of protection.<ref name=Politika/>\n\n== Reconstructions ==\n\nThe fortress was left to the elements from the 18th to the 20th century. First occasional archaeological explorations began in the 19th century, but the survey in earnest began in the 20th century.<ref name=Politika/> First archaeological works and assessment of the object was done by Imre Hanzelman in 1870, who also left a valuable sketches of the ruins. Later exploration by [[Aleksandar Deroko]] and [[\u0110ur\u0111e Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]] contributed to the declaration of the fortress as a [[cultural monument]] in 1948, among the first in Serbia. The protected area includes the remains of the fortified castle with the [[barbican]], the neighborhood of ''Podgra\u0111e'' and the \"Spike\" gate.<ref name=novi/>\n\nMiloje Milo\u0161evi\u0107 conducted the archaeological excavations in the 1960s, instigating the notion for saving the ruins as he reconstructed the keep tower, but the complex wasn't revitalized and the tower remained without a purpose. Another campaign for the revitalization by the archaeologists in the early 1980s also failed. In 1993 a fire broke out inside the keep, ruining for the most part the effects of the previous reconstructions.<ref name=novi/>\n\nEmergency interventions in the complex began in 2003. The thoroughly degraded keep was revitalized. It was a nucleus of the project the \"Centuries of Ba\u010d\" which was envisioned in 2006.<ref name=novi/> That is when the reconstruction and conservation project, which includes the exploration works, began in earnest. The fortress was restored, archaeological sections were conserved while the visitors center was open in the keep. The project was awarded the 2018 [[Europa Nostra]] Award, European Union prize for cultural heritage.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nThe keep is fully operational on all 5 floors. The museum exhibition is set on two storeys. The terracotta plastics found inside is shaped under the influence of the early Renaissance and very rare in this part of Europe. The southern and eastern parts of the ramparts were thoroughly explored and restored, which made them visible above the ground, including the main tower with the gate. The new entry point was made across the wooden bridge through the former pedestrian gate which to the visitors gives the sense to the enclosed yard and understanding of the space which was defended.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe accelerated decay of the western part of the complex, including the tower and the rampart wall, was stopped. Same was done in the northeast section (square tower, chapel tower, stone [[corbel]] tower). As over 60% of the originally built objects is lost for good, the interventions here included the conservation of the remains and \"gentle\" restoration and remediation.

During the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], Ba\u010d became not only the ecclesiastical seat of the Archdiocese, but a royal city, where nobles and rulers came to their councils and assemblies. In the twelfth century Ba\u010d fortress is first mentioned in written sources.\n\nAt the head of Ba\u010dka county there were governors appointed by the king. Until the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Mongol invasion]] in 1241, the governors were the managers of the area. They collected donations, set up military and civilian commanders. In addition to the governors of the fort there were also lower prefects, judges, and military personnel. Since the twelfth century, the custom of annual royal visits to the fort was established.\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century a dynasty change occurred in the Kingdom of Hungary. and the town prospered during the rule of king Charles Robert I, who  started building the modern fortress in 1338-42.<ref name=novi>{{cite news | author = Marija \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 | title = \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0411\u0430\u0447\u0430 | trans-title = New life for the ramparts of Ba\u010d (interview with Slavica Vujovi\u0107, head of the fortress' conservation team) | newspaper = Politika | page = 07 | language = Serbian | date = 16 June 2018}}</ref> The new town (fortress) on Mostonga had the quadrangular tower with six floors, important for the defense of the city. Originally there were 8 towers, various chambers of the county manager, a chapel, guard towers, kitchen, water well, barn, and various other premises, the remains of which stand today.\n\nThe fort and the town developed as Ba\u010d was the major crossroad at the time. Roads from and to Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean all crossed here, and the tall central tower allowed the overseeing and control of the lowlands and both the river and the land traffic.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThough the construction began in the first half of the 14th century, which is the base of what survived until today, the complex was shaped in the present way by the 15th century and reached its full extension by the 16th century. Archbishop {{ill|P\u00e9ter V\u00e1radi|hu|V\u00e1radi P\u00e9ter}} expanded and embellished the fortress and also dredged the Mostonga so that ships from the Danube were able to reach the fort.<ref name=novi/>\n\nFrom the 15th century, it was the most important Hungarian defense point against the invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman forces]]. The pivotal moment was the disastrous Hungarian defeat in 1526 at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], so the Ottomans conquered Ba\u010d in 1529.<ref name=Politika/> During the war between Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, in the 16th century, Serbian despot [[Stevan Berislavi\u0107]] successfully defended the Ba\u010d fortress from the Ottomans for a long time until the fortress finally fell.\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs from 1526, the city and fort became an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] possession.<ref name=edu>{{cite web|title=Ba\u010d Fortress (Ba\u010dka tvr\u0111ava) -- ruins|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/handle/1811/39680|publisher=kb.osu.edu|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (16th-17th century), Ba\u010d was the seat of the [[Kaza]] of Ba\u010d, as part of the [[Sanjak of Segedin]]. Dating from this period are also the descriptions of Ba\u010d Fortress by the Ottoman traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]]. According to his description, the city was surrounded by a wide circle of trenches filled with water. Surrounding the city was also a developing civilian settlement, which could be entered through the fortress drawbridge gate, named the \"Spike\".\n\n=== Later period ===\n\nSince 1686 the town was under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]. The fortress was mined with explosives in 1704, during the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]] (1703\u201311),<ref name=Politika/> and was subsequently abandoned as it was left burned, demolished, and without the previous military importance it had.<ref name=novi/> However, Ba\u010d fortress still remains the best preserved medieval fortress in [[Vojvodina]].<ref name=\"virtu\"/>\n\nAfter 1918, Ba\u010d was part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and subsequent [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] states. It was occupied by [[Hungary]] between 1941-1944, during [[World War II]].\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe medieval fortress in Ba\u010d is known as one of the great fortresses of its time in the Pannonian plain.<ref name=sek>{{cite web|title=Bac |url=http://www.sekcijatvrdjava.org/en/fortresses/bac.html |publisher=www.sekcijatvrdjava.org |accessdate=13 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301192324/http://www.sekcijatvrdjava.org/en/fortresses/bac.html |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> It was built by the town of the same name to the west, on a small island on the river [[Mostonga]]. The Fortress in Ba\u010d is known as one of the so-called \"water towns\", because it used to be surrounded by the Mostonga river on all sides, approachable only by the [[drawbridge]]s.<ref name=un>{{cite web|title=Historical place of Ba\u010d and its Surroundings|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5540/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> It also meant that it was adapted for defense in the lowland and marshy areas.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe ruins of the fortress in its present state, consist of a base in the form of an irregular pentagon (\"[[trapezoid]]\").<ref name=novi/> The fort used to have 8 towers, but five are preserved today. There are four lateral towers while the fifth is the {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} tall [[keep]] (''don\u017eon'').<ref name=Politika/> The trapezoidal base covers {{convert|5,600|m2|abbr=on}}, while the entire plateau on which the tower complex is located has {{convert|8,700|m2|abbr=on}}. The ramparts which connect the towers are massive. Three corner twoers have round base and are open towards the interior of the fort. The northwest tower and the one with the main gate have a square base.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe most fortified was the eastern side, which included the {{ill|''brani\u010d''|sr|Brani\u010d kula}} tower, the keep, residential palace, palace for the knights, water well, [[cistern]] and food storages. On the inside, several objects, of different purpose, directly leaned onto the rampart walls. The materials used for the construction is mostly brickm, while the stone and [[terracotta]] were used for the ornaments.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe Section of Ba\u010d below the fortress is called ''Podgra\u0111e''. It consists of 36 houses in the typical lowland Vojvodina style and is protected, together with the fort, as the [[Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance]]. The section is directly accessed via the bridge across the canal and through the gate, which is still being called the \"Spike\" (''\u0160iljak''). The houses were built from the 18th to the 20th century, and residents are not allowed to change fa\u00e7ades without prior consent from the institutes in charge of protection.<ref name=Politika/>\n\n== Reconstructions ==\n\nThe fortress was left to the elements from the 18th to the 20th century. First occasional archaeological explorations began in the 19th century, but the survey in earnest began in the 20th century.<ref name=Politika/> First archaeological works and assessment of the object was done by Imre Hanzelman in 1870, who also left a valuable sketches of the ruins. Later exploration by [[Aleksandar Deroko]] and [[\u0110ur\u0111e Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]] contributed to the declaration of the fortress as a [[cultural monument]] in 1948, among the first in Serbia. The protected area includes the remains of the fortified castle with the [[barbican]], the neighborhood of ''Podgra\u0111e'' and the \"Spike\" gate.<ref name=novi/>\n\nMiloje Milo\u0161evi\u0107 conducted the archaeological excavations in the 1960s, instigating the notion for saving the ruins as he reconstructed the keep tower, but the complex wasn't revitalized and the tower remained without a purpose. Another campaign for the revitalization by the archaeologists in the early 1980s also failed. In 1993 a fire broke out inside the keep, ruining for the most part the effects of the previous reconstructions.<ref name=novi/>\n\nEmergency interventions in the complex began in 2003. The thoroughly degraded keep was revitalized. It was a nucleus of the project the \"Centuries of Ba\u010d\" which was envisioned in 2006.<ref name=novi/> That is when the reconstruction and conservation project, which includes the exploration works, began in earnest. The fortress was restored, archaeological sections were conserved while the visitors center was open in the keep. The project was awarded the 2018 [[Europa Nostra]] Award, European Union prize for cultural heritage.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nThe keep is fully operational on all 5 floors. The museum exhibition is set on two storeys. The terracotta plastics found inside is shaped under the influence of the early Renaissance and very rare in this part of Europe. The southern and eastern parts of the ramparts were thoroughly explored and restored, which made them visible above the ground, including the main tower with the gate. The new entry point was made across the wooden bridge through the former pedestrian gate which to the visitors gives the sense to the enclosed yard and understanding of the space which was defended.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe accelerated decay of the western part of the complex, including the tower and the rampart wall, was stopped. Same was done in the northeast section (square tower, chapel tower, stone [[corbel]] tower). As over 60% of the originally built objects is lost for good, the interventions here included the conservation of the remains and \"gentle\" restoration and remediation. Techniques used include the old crafts, reviving the technique of the building using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] made with [[quicklime]] and using the locally available raw materials. Educational center was open in ''Podgra\u0111e''.<ref name=novi/>\n\nThe project was awarded the 2018 [[Europa Nostra]] Award, European Union prize for cultural heritage.<ref name=Politika/><ref name=novi/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| bgcolor=\"#ECECEC\" | \n<gallery widths=150px perrow=\"3\" style=\"font-size: small; line-height: 130%;\">\nImage: Ba\u010d,_view_of_the_fortress_and_the_town.jpg | View of the fortress and Ba\u010d town\nImage: Ba\u010d_fortress,_view_from_the_south.jpg | View of the fortress from the south\nImage: Ba\u010d fortress, view from the south-east.jpg | View from the south-east\n</gallery>\n|}\n</center>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[List of fortresses in Serbia]]\n*[[Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ba\u010d Fortress}}\n* [http://www.dvorci.info/dvorci/bac/infoc.htm Ba\u010d Fortress]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cultural Heritage of Exceptional Importance}}\n{{World Heritage Site 'Tentative List' applicants in Serbia}}\n{{Castles, fortresses and palaces in Serbia|state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bac Fortress}}\n[[Category:Ba\u010d, Serbia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Vojvodina]]\n[[Category:Forts in Serbia]]\n[[Category:History of Ba\u010dka]]\n[[Category:Medieval history of Vojvodina]]\n[[Category:Ottoman history of Vojvodina]]\n[[Category:Ruins in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Vojvodina]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1338-42 \u2192 1338\u201342 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%8D_Fortress"}
