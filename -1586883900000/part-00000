{"title_page": "List of Bluetooth profiles", "text_new": "[[File:Bluetooth.svg|150px|thumb|A Bluetooth logo.]]\n\nIn order to use , a device must be compatible with the subset of Bluetooth ''profiles'' (often called services) necessary to use the desired services. A Bluetooth profile is a specification regarding an aspect of Bluetooth-based wireless communication between devices. It resides on top of the Bluetooth Core Specification and (optionally) additional protocols. While the profile may use certain features of the core specification, specific versions of profiles are rarely tied to specific versions of the core specification. For example, there are Hands-Free Profile (HFP) 1.5 implementations using both Bluetooth 2.0 and Bluetooth 1.2 core specifications.\n\nThe way a device uses Bluetooth depends on its profile capabilities. The profiles provide standards which manufacturers follow to allow devices to use Bluetooth in the intended manner. For the  stack according to Bluetooth 4.0 a special set of profiles applies.\n\nAt a minimum, each profile specification contains information on the following topics:\n* Dependencies on other formats\n* Suggested user interface formats\n* Specific parts of the Bluetooth  used by the profile. To perform its task, each profile uses particular options and parameters at each layer of the stack. This may include an outline of the required service record, if appropriate.\n\nThis article summarizes the current definitions of profiles defined and adopted by the  and possible applications of each profile.\n\n== Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) ==\n\nThis profile defines how multimedia audio can be streamed from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection (it is also called Bluetooth Audio Streaming). For example, music can be streamed from a mobile phone to a wireless [[headphones|headset]], hearing aid/[[cochlear implant]] streamer, or car audio; alternately from a laptop/desktop to a wireless headset; also, voice can be streamed from a microphone device to a recorder on a PC.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bluetooth Tutorial - Profiles | publisher = palowireless Pty Ltd | url = http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/profiles.asp | accessdate = 2007-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013718/http://palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/profiles.asp |archive-date=2013-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) is often used in conjunction with A2DP for remote control on devices such as headphones, car audio systems, or stand-alone speaker units. These systems often also implement [[#Headset Profile (HSP)|Headset (HSP)]] or Hands-Free (HFP) profiles for telephone calls, which may be used separately.\n\nEach A2DP service, of possibly many, is designed to uni-directionally transfer an audio stream in up to 2 channel stereo, either to or from the Bluetooth host.<ref>[https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=260859&vId=290074 Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, Adopted Version 1.0]</ref> This profile relies on [[AVDTP]] and [[GAVDP]]. It includes mandatory support for the low-complexity [[SBC (codec)|SBC]] codec (not to be confused with Bluetooth's voice-signal codecs such as [[Continuously variable slope delta modulation|CVSDM]]), and supports optionally [[MPEG-1#Part 3: Audio|MPEG-1 Part 3]]/[[MPEG-2 Part 3]] ([[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] and [[MP3]]), MPEG-2 Part 7/[[MPEG-4 Part 3]] ([[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding|HE-AAC]]), and [[ATRAC]], and is extensible to support manufacturer-defined [[codec]]s, such as [[aptX]].<ref>{{ cite web | author = | title = Bluetooth Technology for Headphones | publisher = runnerwave.com | date = |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526215523/http://www.runnerwave.com/bluetooth-headphone-technologies/ |archive-date=2016-05-26 |url-status=dead | url = http://www.runnerwave.com/bluetooth-headphone-technologies/ | accessdate = 2015-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nSome Bluetooth stacks enforce the [[Serial Copy Management System|SCMS-T]] [[digital rights management]] (DRM) scheme. In these cases, it is impossible to connect certain A2DP headphones for high quality audio.\n\n== Attribute Profile (ATT) ==\n\nThe ATT is a wire application protocol for the [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] specification. It is closely related to Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).\n\n== Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) ==\n\nThis profile is designed to provide a standard interface to control TVs, Hi-fi equipment, etc. to allow a single [[remote control]] (or other device) to control all of the A/V equipment to which a user has access. It may be used in concert with A2DP or VDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/AVRCP.aspx|title=Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP)|publisher=Bluetooth.org |accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> It is commonly used in car navigation systems to control streaming Bluetooth audio.\n\nIt also has the possibility for vendor-dependent extensions.\n\nAVRCP has several versions with significantly increasing functionality:\n* 1.0 \u2014 Basic remote control commands (play/pause/stop, etc.)\n* 1.3 \u2014 all of 1.0 plus metadata and media-player state support\n** The status of the music source (playing, stopped, etc.)\n** Metadata information on the track itself (artist, track name, etc.).\n* 1.4 \u2014 all of 1.3 plus media browsing capabilities for multiple media players\n** Browsing and manipulation of multiple players\n** Browsing of media metadata per media player, including a \"Now Playing\" list\n** Basic search capabilities\n** Support for Absolute volume\n* 1.5 \u2014 all of 1.4 plus specification corrections and clarifications to absolute volume control, browsing and other features\n* 1.6 \u2014 all of 1.5 plus browsing data and track information<ref>{{Cite web|title = Adopted Specifications {{!}} Bluetooth Technology Website|url = https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications|website = www.bluetooth.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}</ref>\n** Number of items that are in a folder without downloading the list\n** Support for transmitting cover arts through the BIP over OBEX protocol.\n\n== Basic Imaging Profile (BIP) ==\n\nThis profile is designed for sending images between devices and includes the ability to resize, and convert images to make them suitable for the receiving device. It may be broken down into smaller pieces:\n; Image Push: Allows the sending of images from a device the user controls.\n; Image Pull: Allows the browsing and retrieval of images from a remote device.\n; Advanced Image Printing: print images with advanced options using the [[DPOF]] format developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Kodak]], [[Fujifilm]], and [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]\n; Automatic Archive: Allows the automatic backup of all the new images from a target device. For example, a [[laptop]] could download all of the new pictures from a camera whenever it is within range.\n; Remote Camera: Allows the initiator to remotely use a [[digital camera]]. For example, a user could place a camera on a tripod for a group photo, use their phone handset to check that everyone is in frame, and activate the shutter with the user in the photo.\n; Remote Display: Allows the initiator to push images to be displayed on another device. For example, a user could give a presentation by sending the slides to a [[video projector]].\n\n== Basic Printing Profile (BPP) ==\n\nThis allows devices to send text, e-mails, [[vCard]]s, or other items to [[computer printer|printers]] based on print jobs. It differs from HCRP in that it needs no printer-specific drivers. This makes it more suitable for embedded devices such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[digital camera]]s which cannot easily be updated with drivers dependent upon printer vendors.\n\n== Common ISDN Access Profile (CIP) ==\n\nThis provides unrestricted access to the services, data and signalling that [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] offers.\n\n== Cordless Telephony Profile (CTP) ==\n\nThis is designed for [[Cordless telephone|cordless phones]] to work using Bluetooth. It is hoped that mobile phones could use a Bluetooth CTP gateway connected to a [[landline]] when within the home, and the mobile phone network when out of range. It is central to the [[Bluetooth SIG]]'s \"3-in-1 phone\" use case.\n\n== Device ID Profile (DIP) ==\n\nThis profile allows a device to be identified above and beyond the limitations of the Device Class already available in Bluetooth.  It enables identification of the manufacturer, product id, product version, and the version of the Device ID specification being met.  It is useful in allowing a PC to identify a connecting device and download appropriate [[Device driver|driver]]s.  It enables similar applications to those the [[Plug-and-play]] specification allows.\n\nThis is important in order to make best use of the features on the device identified. A few examples illustrating possible uses of this information are listed below:\n\n# In PC-to-PC usage models (such as conference table and file transfer), a PC may use this information to supplement information from other Bluetooth specifications to identify the right device to communicate with.\n# A cellular phone may use this information to identify associated accessories or download Java apps from another device that advertises its availability.\n# In PC to peripheral usage models (such as dial up networking using a cellular phone), the PC may need to download device drivers or other software for that peripheral from a web site. To do this the driver must know the proper identity of the peripheral. Note that devices are expected to provide some basic functionality using only the Bluetooth profile implementation, and that additional software loaded using the Device ID information should only be necessary for extended or proprietary features. Likewise, devices which access a profile in another device are expected to be able provide the basic services of the profile regardless of the presence or absence of Device ID information.\n\n== Dial-up Networking Profile (DUN) ==\n\nThis profile provides a standard to access the [[Internet]] and other [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] services over Bluetooth. The most common scenario is accessing the Internet from a [[laptop]] by dialing up on a [[mobile phone]], wirelessly. It is based on [[Serial Port Profile]] (SPP), and provides for relatively easy conversion of existing products, through the many features that it has in common with the existing wired [[Serial Line Internet Protocol|serial protocol]]s for the same task. These include the [[Hayes command set|AT command]] set specified in [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) 07.07, and [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP).\n\nDUN distinguishes the initiator (DUN Terminal) of the connection and the provider (DUN Gateway) of the connection. The gateway provides a modem interface and establishes the connection to a PPP gateway. The terminal implements the usage of the modem and PPP protocol to establish the network connection. In standard phones, the gateway PPP functionality is usually implemented by the access point of the Telco provider. In \"always on\" smartphones, the PPP gateway is often provided by the phone and the terminal shares the connection.\n\n== Fax Profile (FAX) ==\n\nThis profile is intended to provide a well-defined interface between a mobile phone or [[landline|fixed-line phone]] and a PC with Fax software installed. Support must be provided for ITU T.31 and / or ITU T.32 [[Hayes command set|AT command]] sets as defined by [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]]. Data and voice calls are not covered by this profile.\n\n== File Transfer Profile (FTP) ==\n\nProvides the capability to add, manipulate and transfer objects (files accounts and folders) in an object store (file system) of another system. Uses GOEP as a basis.\n\n== Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile (GAVDP) ==\n\nGAVDP provides the basis for [[#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_(A2DP)|A2DP]] and [[#Video_Distribution_Profile_(VDP)|VDP]], the basis of the systems designed for distributing video and audio streams using Bluetooth technology.\n\nThe GAVDP defines two roles, that of an Initiator and an Acceptor:\n* Initiator (INT) \u2013 This is the device that initiates a signaling procedure. \n* Acceptor (ACP) \u2013 This is the device that shall respond to an incoming request from the INT \n<blockquote>Note: the roles are not fixed to the devices. The roles are determined when you initiate a signaling procedure, and they are released when the procedure ends. The roles can be switched between two devices when a new procedure is initiated.</blockquote>The Baseband, LMP, L2CAP, and SDP are Bluetooth protocols defined in the Bluetooth Core specifications. AVDTP consists of a signaling entity for negotiation of streaming parameters and a transport entity that handles the streaming.\n\n== Generic Access Profile (GAP) ==\n\nProvides the basis for all other profiles. GAP defines how two Bluetooth units discover and establish a connection with each other.\n\n== Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) ==\n\nProvides profile discovery and description services for [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] protocol. It defines how ATT attributes are grouped together into sets to form services.<ref>[https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt GATT]</ref>\n\n== Generic Object Exchange Profile (GOEP) ==\n\nProvides a basis for other data profiles. Based on [[OBEX]] and sometimes referred to as such.\n\n== Hard Copy Cable Replacement Profile (HCRP) ==\n\nThis provides a simple wireless alternative to a cable connection between a device and a printer. Unfortunately it does not set a standard regarding the actual communications to the printer, so [[device driver|drivers]] are required specific to the printer model or range. This makes this profile less useful for embedded devices such as digital cameras and palmtops, as updating drivers can be problematic.\n\n== Health Device Profile (HDP) ==\n\nHealth Thermometer profile (HTP) and Heart Rate Profile (HRP) fall under this category as well.\n\nProfile designed to facilitate transmission and reception of Medical Device data. The APIs of this layer interact with the lower level Multi-Channel Adaptation Protocol (MCAP layer), but also perform [[Service discovery|SDP]] behavior to connect to remote HDP devices. Also makes use of the Device ID Profile (DIP).\n\n== Hands-Free Profile (HFP) ==\n\nThis profile is used to allow car hands-free kits to communicate with mobile phones in the car. It commonly uses Synchronous Connection Oriented link ([[Bluetooth protocols#Synchronous connection-oriented .28SCO.29 link|SCO]]) to carry a [[monaural]] audio channel with [[continuously variable slope delta modulation]] or [[pulse-code modulation]], and with logarithmic [[A-law algorithm|a-law]] or [[\u03bc-law algorithm|\u03bc-law]] quantization. Version 1.6 adds optional support for wide band speech with the mSBC codec, a 16&nbsp;kHz monaural configuration of the [[SBC (codec)|SBC]] codec mandated by the [[#Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)|A2DP]] profile. Version 1.7 adds indicator support to report such things as headset battery level.\n\nIn 2002 [[Audi]], with the Audi A8, was the first motor vehicle manufacturer to install Bluetooth technology in a car, enabling the passenger to use a wireless in-car phone. The following year [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[Acura]] introduced Bluetooth technology integration with the audio system as a standard feature in the third-generation [[Acura TL]] in a system dubbed HandsFree Link (HFL). Later, [[BMW]] added it as an option on its [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]], [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]], [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]], [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]] and [[BMW X5|X5]] vehicles. Since then, other manufacturers have followed suit, with many vehicles, including the [[Toyota Prius]] (since 2004), 2007 [[Toyota Camry]], 2007 [[Infiniti G35]], and the [[Lexus]] LS 430 (since 2004). Several [[Nissan]] models ([[Nissan Versa|Versa]], X-Trail) include a built-in Bluetooth for the Technology option. [[Volvo]] started introducing support in some vehicles in 2007, and as of 2009 all Bluetooth-enabled vehicles support HFP.<ref>{{ cite web |  title = Bluetooth FAQ \u2013 Wireless In-Car Mobile Phone Technology \u2013 Volvo |  url = http://www.volvocars.com/au/sales-services/sales/car-devices/bluetooth/pages/faq.aspx |  accessdate = 27 Apr 2010 |  quote = phones must have the Bluetooth hands-free profile to be able to connect with the Volvo vehicle. }}</ref>\n\nMany Car Audio Consumer Electronics manufacturers like Kenwood, JVC, Sony, Pioneer and Alpine build car audio receivers that house Bluetooth modules all supporting various HFP versions.\n\nBluetooth car kits allow users with Bluetooth-equipped cell phones to make use of some of the phone's features, such as making calls, while the phone itself can be left in the user's pocket or hand bag. Companies like [[Visteon|Visteon Corp.]], [[Peiker acustic]], [http://www.egohandsfree.com RAYTEL], [[Parrot SA]], [[Novero]], Dension, S1NN and Motorola manufacture Bluetooth hands-free car kits for well-known brand car manufacturers.\n\nMost Bluetooth headsets implement both Hands-Free Profile and Headset Profile, because of the extra features in HFP for use with a mobile phone, such as last number redial, call waiting and voice dialing.\n\nThe mobile phone side of an HFP link is Audio Gateway or HFP Server.  The automobile side of HFP link is Car Kit or HFP Client.\n\n== Human Interface Device Profile (HID) ==\n\nProvides support for devices such as [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], [[joystick]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s, and simple buttons and indicators on other types of devices.  It is designed to provide a low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] link, with low power requirements.  [[PlayStation 3]] controllers and [[Wii]] remotes also use Bluetooth HID.\n\nBluetooth HID is a lightweight wrapper of the [[human interface device]] protocol defined for [[USB]].  The use of the HID protocol simplifies host implementation (ex: support by [[operating system]]s) by enabling the re-use of some of the existing support for USB HID to also support Bluetooth HID.\n\nKeyboard and keypads must be secure. For other HIDs security is optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n7_hid.asp#HID%20Security |website=www.palowireless.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003050/http://palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n7_hid.asp |archive-date=2013-03-20 |title=Human Interface Device Profile |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Headset Profile (HSP) ==\n\nThis is the most commonly used profile, providing support for the popular Bluetooth headsets to be used with mobile phones and gaming consoles. It relies on SCO  audio encoded in 64&nbsp;kbit/s CVSD or PCM and a subset of [[Hayes command set|AT command]]s from GSM 07.07 for minimal controls including the ability to ring, answer a call, hang up and adjust the volume.\n\n== Intercom Profile (ICP) ==\n\nThis is often referred to as the [[walkie-talkie]] profile. It is another [[List of Bluetooth protocols#Telephony control protocol .28TCS.29|TCS]] based profile, relying on SCO to carry the audio. It is proposed to allow voice calls between two Bluetooth capable handsets, over Bluetooth.\n\nThe ICP standard was withdrawn on 10-June-2010 <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/profiles-overview/deprecated-profiles |title=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/deprecated-specifications |access-date=2017-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220214/https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/profiles-overview/deprecated-profiles |archive-date=2017-09-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>.\n\n== LAN Access Profile (LAP) ==\n\nLAN Access profile makes it possible for a Bluetooth device to access [[LAN]], [[Wide area network|WAN]] or [[Internet]] via another device that has a physical connection to the network. It uses [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] over [[RFCOMM]] to establish connections.

Mostly used for automotive handsfree use. The MAP profile can also be used for other uses that require the exchange of messages between two devices. The automotive Hands-Free use case is where an on-board terminal device (typically an electronic device as a Car-Kit installed in the car) can talk via messaging capability to another communication device (typically a mobile phone). For example, Bluetooth MAP is used by HP Send and receive text (SMS) messages from a Palm/HP smartphone to an HP TouchPad tablet.<ref>[http://kb.hpwebos.com/wps/portal/kb/na/touchpad/touchpad/wifi/solutions/article/21765_en.html Using Bluetooth wireless technology on a webOS device]</ref> Bluetooth MAP is used by Ford in select SYNC Generation 1-equipped 2011 and 2012 vehicles <ref>[http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-new-sync-software-update-adds-35451 New SYNC Software Update Adds Bluetooth MAP Standard; Ford Poised to Give More Drivers Safer Texting Alternatives]</ref> and also by BMW with many of their iDrive systems. The Lexus LX and GS 2013 models both also support MAP as does the Honda CRV 2012, Acura 2013 and ILX 2013. Apple introduced Bluetooth MAP in iOS 6 for the iPhone and iPad.

As this profile originated as part of the [[Infrared Data Association|infrared]] specifications but has been adopted by the Bluetooth SIG to form part of the main Bluetooth specification, it is also commonly referred to as IrMC Synchronization.\n\n== Synchronisation Mark-up Language Profile (SyncML) ==\n\nFor Bluetooth, Synchronization is one of the most important areas. The Bluetooth specifications up to, and including 1.1, has Synchronization Profile that is based on IrMC. Later, many of the companies in the Bluetooth SIG already had proprietary synchronization solutions and they did not want to implement IrMC -based synchronization also, hence [[SyncML]] emerged. SyncML is an open industry initiative for common data synchronization protocol. The SyncML protocol has been developed by some of the leading companies in their sectors, Lotus, Motorola, Ericsson, Matsushita Communication Industrial Co., Nokia, IBM, Palm Inc., Psion and Starfish Software; together with over 600 SyncML Supporter companies. SyncML is a synchronization protocol that can be used by devices to communicate the changes that have taken place in the data that is stored within them. However, SyncML is capable of delivering more than just basic synchronization; it is extensible, providing powerful commands to allow searching and execution.\n\n== Video Distribution Profile (VDP) ==\n\nThis profile allows the transport of a video stream. It could be used for streaming a recorded video from a PC media center to a portable player, or a live video from a digital video camera to a TV. Support for the [[H.263]] baseline is mandatory.

A Bluetooth profile is a specification regarding an aspect of Bluetooth-based wireless communication between devices. It resides on top of the Bluetooth Core Specification and (optionally) additional protocols. While the profile may use certain features of the core specification, specific versions of profiles are rarely tied to specific versions of the core specification. For example, there are Hands-Free Profile (HFP) 1.5 implementations using both Bluetooth 2.0 and Bluetooth 1.2 core specifications.\n\nThe way a device uses Bluetooth depends on its profile capabilities. The profiles provide standards which manufacturers follow to allow devices to use Bluetooth in the intended manner. For the [[Bluetooth low energy]] stack according to Bluetooth 4.0 a special set of profiles applies.\n\nAt a minimum, each profile specification contains information on the following topics:\n* Dependencies on other formats\n* Suggested user interface formats\n* Specific parts of the Bluetooth [[protocol stack]] used by the profile. To perform its task, each profile uses particular options and parameters at each layer of the stack. This may include an outline of the required service record, if appropriate.\n\nThis article summarizes the current definitions of profiles defined and adopted by the [[Bluetooth SIG]] and possible applications of each profile.\n\n== Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) ==\n\nThis profile defines how multimedia audio can be streamed from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection (it is also called Bluetooth Audio Streaming). For example, music can be streamed from a mobile phone to a wireless [[headphones|headset]], hearing aid/[[cochlear implant]] streamer, or car audio; alternately from a laptop/desktop to a wireless headset; also, voice can be streamed from a microphone device to a recorder on a PC.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bluetooth Tutorial - Profiles | publisher = palowireless Pty Ltd | url = http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/profiles.asp | accessdate = 2007-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013718/http://palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/profiles.asp |archive-date=2013-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) is often used in conjunction with A2DP for remote control on devices such as headphones, car audio systems, or stand-alone speaker units. These systems often also implement [[#Headset Profile (HSP)|Headset (HSP)]] or Hands-Free (HFP) profiles for telephone calls, which may be used separately.\n\nEach A2DP service, of possibly many, is designed to uni-directionally transfer an audio stream in up to 2 channel stereo, either to or from the Bluetooth host.<ref>[https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=260859&vId=290074 Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, Adopted Version 1.0]</ref> This profile relies on [[AVDTP]] and [[GAVDP]].

In these cases, it is impossible to connect certain A2DP headphones for high quality audio.\n\n== Attribute Profile (ATT) ==\n\nThe ATT is a wire application protocol for the [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] specification. It is closely related to Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).\n\n== Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) ==\n\nThis profile is designed to provide a standard interface to control TVs, Hi-fi equipment, etc. to allow a single [[remote control]] (or other device) to control all of the A/V equipment to which a user has access. It may be used in concert with A2DP or VDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/AVRCP.aspx|title=Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP)|publisher=Bluetooth.org |accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> It is commonly used in car navigation systems to control streaming Bluetooth audio.\n\nIt also has the possibility for vendor-dependent extensions.\n\nAVRCP has several versions with significantly increasing functionality:\n* 1.0 \u2014 Basic remote control commands (play/pause/stop, etc.)\n* 1.3 \u2014 all of 1.0 plus metadata and media-player state support\n** The status of the music source (playing, stopped, etc.)\n** Metadata information on the track itself (artist, track name, etc.).\n* 1.4 \u2014 all of 1.3 plus media browsing capabilities for multiple media players\n** Browsing and manipulation of multiple players\n** Browsing of media metadata per media player, including a \"Now Playing\" list\n** Basic search capabilities\n** Support for Absolute volume\n* 1.5 \u2014 all of 1.4 plus specification corrections and clarifications to absolute volume control, browsing and other features\n* 1.6 \u2014 all of 1.5 plus browsing data and track information<ref>{{Cite web|title = Adopted Specifications {{!}} Bluetooth Technology Website|url = https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications|website = www.bluetooth.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}</ref>\n** Number of items that are in a folder without downloading the list\n** Support for transmitting cover arts through the BIP over OBEX protocol.\n\n== Basic Imaging Profile (BIP) ==\n\nThis profile is designed for sending images between devices and includes the ability to resize, and convert images to make them suitable for the receiving device. It may be broken down into smaller pieces:\n; Image Push: Allows the sending of images from a device the user controls.\n; Image Pull: Allows the browsing and retrieval of images from a remote device.\n; Advanced Image Printing: print images with advanced options using the [[DPOF]] format developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Kodak]], [[Fujifilm]], and [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]\n; Automatic Archive: Allows the automatic backup of all the new images from a target device. For example, a [[laptop]] could download all of the new pictures from a camera whenever it is within range.\n; Remote Camera: Allows the initiator to remotely use a [[digital camera]]. For example, a user could place a camera on a tripod for a group photo, use their phone handset to check that everyone is in frame, and activate the shutter with the user in the photo.\n; Remote Display: Allows the initiator to push images to be displayed on another device. For example, a user could give a presentation by sending the slides to a [[video projector]].\n\n== Basic Printing Profile (BPP) ==\n\nThis allows devices to send text, e-mails, [[vCard]]s, or other items to [[computer printer|printers]] based on print jobs. It differs from HCRP in that it needs no printer-specific drivers. This makes it more suitable for embedded devices such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[digital camera]]s which cannot easily be updated with drivers dependent upon printer vendors.\n\n== Common ISDN Access Profile (CIP) ==\n\nThis provides unrestricted access to the services, data and signalling that [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] offers.\n\n== Cordless Telephony Profile (CTP) ==\n\nThis is designed for [[Cordless telephone|cordless phones]] to work using Bluetooth. It is hoped that mobile phones could use a Bluetooth CTP gateway connected to a [[landline]] when within the home, and the mobile phone network when out of range. It is central to the [[Bluetooth SIG]]'s \"3-in-1 phone\" use case.\n\n== Device ID Profile (DIP) ==\n\nThis profile allows a device to be identified above and beyond the limitations of the Device Class already available in Bluetooth.  It enables identification of the manufacturer, product id, product version, and the version of the Device ID specification being met.  It is useful in allowing a PC to identify a connecting device and download appropriate [[Device driver|driver]]s.  It enables similar applications to those the [[Plug-and-play]] specification allows.\n\nThis is important in order to make best use of the features on the device identified. A few examples illustrating possible uses of this information are listed below:\n\n# In PC-to-PC usage models (such as conference table and file transfer), a PC may use this information to supplement information from other Bluetooth specifications to identify the right device to communicate with.\n# A cellular phone may use this information to identify associated accessories or download Java apps from another device that advertises its availability.\n# In PC to peripheral usage models (such as dial up networking using a cellular phone), the PC may need to download device drivers or other software for that peripheral from a web site. To do this the driver must know the proper identity of the peripheral. Note that devices are expected to provide some basic functionality using only the Bluetooth profile implementation, and that additional software loaded using the Device ID information should only be necessary for extended or proprietary features. Likewise, devices which access a profile in another device are expected to be able provide the basic services of the profile regardless of the presence or absence of Device ID information.\n\n== Dial-up Networking Profile (DUN) ==\n\nThis profile provides a standard to access the [[Internet]] and other [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] services over Bluetooth. The most common scenario is accessing the Internet from a [[laptop]] by dialing up on a [[mobile phone]], wirelessly. It is based on [[Serial Port Profile]] (SPP), and provides for relatively easy conversion of existing products, through the many features that it has in common with the existing wired [[Serial Line Internet Protocol|serial protocol]]s for the same task. These include the [[Hayes command set|AT command]] set specified in [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) 07.07, and [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP).\n\nDUN distinguishes the initiator (DUN Terminal) of the connection and the provider (DUN Gateway) of the connection. The gateway provides a modem interface and establishes the connection to a PPP gateway. The terminal implements the usage of the modem and PPP protocol to establish the network connection. In standard phones, the gateway PPP functionality is usually implemented by the access point of the Telco provider. In \"always on\" smartphones, the PPP gateway is often provided by the phone and the terminal shares the connection.\n\n== Fax Profile (FAX) ==\n\nThis profile is intended to provide a well-defined interface between a mobile phone or [[landline|fixed-line phone]] and a PC with Fax software installed. Support must be provided for ITU T.31 and / or ITU T.32 [[Hayes command set|AT command]] sets as defined by [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]]. Data and voice calls are not covered by this profile.\n\n== File Transfer Profile (FTP) ==\n\nProvides the capability to add, manipulate and transfer objects (files accounts and folders) in an object store (file system) of another system. Uses GOEP as a basis.\n\n== Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile (GAVDP) ==\n\nGAVDP provides the basis for [[#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_(A2DP)|A2DP]] and [[#Video_Distribution_Profile_(VDP)|VDP]], the basis of the systems designed for distributing video and audio streams using Bluetooth technology.\n\nThe GAVDP defines two roles, that of an Initiator and an Acceptor:\n* Initiator (INT) \u2013 This is the device that initiates a signaling procedure. \n* Acceptor (ACP) \u2013 This is the device that shall respond to an incoming request from the INT \n<blockquote>Note: the roles are not fixed to the devices. The roles are determined when you initiate a signaling procedure, and they are released when the procedure ends. The roles can be switched between two devices when a new procedure is initiated.</blockquote>The Baseband, LMP, L2CAP, and SDP are Bluetooth protocols defined in the Bluetooth Core specifications. AVDTP consists of a signaling entity for negotiation of streaming parameters and a transport entity that handles the streaming.\n\n== Generic Access Profile (GAP) ==\n\nProvides the basis for all other profiles. GAP defines how two Bluetooth units discover and establish a connection with each other.\n\n== Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) ==\n\nProvides profile discovery and description services for [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] protocol. It defines how ATT attributes are grouped together into sets to form services.<ref>[https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt GATT]</ref>\n\n== Generic Object Exchange Profile (GOEP) ==\n\nProvides a basis for other data profiles. Based on [[OBEX]] and sometimes referred to as such.\n\n== Hard Copy Cable Replacement Profile (HCRP) ==\n\nThis provides a simple wireless alternative to a cable connection between a device and a printer. Unfortunately it does not set a standard regarding the actual communications to the printer, so [[device driver|drivers]] are required specific to the printer model or range. This makes this profile less useful for embedded devices such as digital cameras and palmtops, as updating drivers can be problematic.\n\n== Health Device Profile (HDP) ==\n\nHealth Thermometer profile (HTP) and Heart Rate Profile (HRP) fall under this category as well.\n\nProfile designed to facilitate transmission and reception of Medical Device data. The APIs of this layer interact with the lower level Multi-Channel Adaptation Protocol (MCAP layer), but also perform [[Service discovery|SDP]] behavior to connect to remote HDP devices. Also makes use of the Device ID Profile (DIP).\n\n== Hands-Free Profile (HFP) ==\n\nThis profile is used to allow car hands-free kits to communicate with mobile phones in the car. It commonly uses Synchronous Connection Oriented link ([[Bluetooth protocols#Synchronous connection-oriented .28SCO.29 link|SCO]]) to carry a [[monaural]] audio channel with [[continuously variable slope delta modulation]] or [[pulse-code modulation]], and with logarithmic [[A-law algorithm|a-law]] or [[\u03bc-law algorithm|\u03bc-law]] quantization. Version 1.6 adds optional support for wide band speech with the mSBC codec, a 16&nbsp;kHz monaural configuration of the [[SBC (codec)|SBC]] codec mandated by the [[#Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)|A2DP]] profile. Version 1.7 adds indicator support to report such things as headset battery level.\n\nIn 2002 [[Audi]], with the Audi A8, was the first motor vehicle manufacturer to install Bluetooth technology in a car, enabling the passenger to use a wireless in-car phone. The following year [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[Acura]] introduced Bluetooth technology integration with the audio system as a standard feature in the third-generation [[Acura TL]] in a system dubbed HandsFree Link (HFL). Later, [[BMW]] added it as an option on its [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]], [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]], [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]], [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]] and [[BMW X5|X5]] vehicles. Since then, other manufacturers have followed suit, with many vehicles, including the [[Toyota Prius]] (since 2004), 2007 [[Toyota Camry]], 2007 [[Infiniti G35]], and the [[Lexus]] LS 430 (since 2004). Several [[Nissan]] models ([[Nissan Versa|Versa]], X-Trail) include a built-in Bluetooth for the Technology option. [[Volvo]] started introducing support in some vehicles in 2007, and as of 2009 all Bluetooth-enabled vehicles support HFP.<ref>{{ cite web |  title = Bluetooth FAQ \u2013 Wireless In-Car Mobile Phone Technology \u2013 Volvo |  url = http://www.volvocars.com/au/sales-services/sales/car-devices/bluetooth/pages/faq.aspx |  accessdate = 27 Apr 2010 |  quote = phones must have the Bluetooth hands-free profile to be able to connect with the Volvo vehicle. }}</ref>\n\nMany Car Audio Consumer Electronics manufacturers like Kenwood, JVC, Sony, Pioneer and Alpine build car audio receivers that house Bluetooth modules all supporting various HFP versions.\n\nBluetooth car kits allow users with Bluetooth-equipped cell phones to make use of some of the phone's features, such as making calls, while the phone itself can be left in the user's pocket or hand bag. Companies like [[Visteon|Visteon Corp.]], [[Peiker acustic]], [http://www.egohandsfree.com RAYTEL], [[Parrot SA]], [[Novero]], Dension, S1NN and Motorola manufacture Bluetooth hands-free car kits for well-known brand car manufacturers.\n\nMost Bluetooth headsets implement both Hands-Free Profile and Headset Profile, because of the extra features in HFP for use with a mobile phone, such as last number redial, call waiting and voice dialing.\n\nThe mobile phone side of an HFP link is Audio Gateway or HFP Server.  The automobile side of HFP link is Car Kit or HFP Client.\n\n== Human Interface Device Profile (HID) ==\n\nProvides support for devices such as [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], [[joystick]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s, and simple buttons and indicators on other types of devices.  It is designed to provide a low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] link, with low power requirements.  [[PlayStation 3]] controllers and [[Wii]] remotes also use Bluetooth HID.\n\nBluetooth HID is a lightweight wrapper of the [[human interface device]] protocol defined for [[USB]].  The use of the HID protocol simplifies host implementation (ex: support by [[operating system]]s) by enabling the re-use of some of the existing support for USB HID to also support Bluetooth HID.\n\nKeyboard and keypads must be secure. For other HIDs security is optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n7_hid.asp#HID%20Security |website=www.palowireless.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003050/http://palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n7_hid.asp |archive-date=2013-03-20 |title=Human Interface Device Profile |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Headset Profile (HSP) ==\n\nThis is the most commonly used profile, providing support for the popular Bluetooth headsets to be used with mobile phones and gaming consoles. It relies on SCO  audio encoded in 64&nbsp;kbit/s CVSD or PCM and a subset of [[Hayes command set|AT command]]s from GSM 07.07 for minimal controls including the ability to ring, answer a call, hang up and adjust the volume.\n\n== Intercom Profile (ICP) ==\n\nThis is often referred to as the [[walkie-talkie]] profile. It is another [[List of Bluetooth protocols#Telephony control protocol .28TCS.29|TCS]] based profile, relying on SCO to carry the audio. It is proposed to allow voice calls between two Bluetooth capable handsets, over Bluetooth.\n\nThe ICP standard was withdrawn on 10-June-2010 <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/profiles-overview/deprecated-profiles |title=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/deprecated-specifications |access-date=2017-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220214/https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/profiles-overview/deprecated-profiles |archive-date=2017-09-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>.\n\n== LAN Access Profile (LAP) ==\n\nLAN Access profile makes it possible for a Bluetooth device to access [[LAN]], [[Wide area network|WAN]] or [[Internet]] via another device that has a physical connection to the network. It uses [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] over [[RFCOMM]] to establish connections. LAP also allows the device to join an ad-hoc Bluetooth network.\n\nThe LAN Access Profile has been replaced by the [[#Personal Area Networking Profile (PAN)|PAN]] profile in the Bluetooth specification.\n\n==  Mesh Profile (MESH)  ==\n{{main article|Bluetooth mesh networking}}\nMesh Profile Specification<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=429633|title=Mesh Profile Bluetooth\u00ae Specification|last=|first=|date=2017-07-13|website=Bluetooth Technology Website|format=PDF download|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> allows for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth radio. It supports data encryption, message authentication and is meant for building efficient smart lighting systems and IoT networks.\n\nApplication layer for Bluetooth Mesh has been defined in a separate Mesh Model Specification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=429634|title=Mesh Model Bluetooth\u00ae Specification|last=|first=|date=2017-07-13|website=Bluetooth Technology Website|format=PDF download|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> As of release 1.0 lighting, sensors, time, scenes and generic devices has been defined.\n\nAdditionally, application-specific properties has been defined in Mesh Device Properties<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=429635|title=Mesh Device Properties Bluetooth\u00ae Specification|last=|first=|date=2017-07-13|website=Bluetooth Technology Website|format=PDF download|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Specification, which contains the definitions for all mesh-specific GATT characteristics and their descriptors.\n\n==  Message Access Profile (MAP)  ==\n\nMessage Access Profile (MAP)<ref>[https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=215400 Message Access Profile_SPEC_V10]</ref> specification allows exchange of messages between devices. Mostly used for automotive handsfree use. The MAP profile can also be used for other uses that require the exchange of messages between two devices. The automotive Hands-Free use case is where an on-board terminal device (typically an electronic device as a Car-Kit installed in the car) can talk via messaging capability to another communication device (typically a mobile phone). For example, Bluetooth MAP is used by HP Send and receive text (SMS) messages from a Palm/HP smartphone to an HP TouchPad tablet.<ref>[http://kb.hpwebos.com/wps/portal/kb/na/touchpad/touchpad/wifi/solutions/article/21765_en.html Using Bluetooth wireless technology on a webOS device]</ref> Bluetooth MAP is used by Ford in select SYNC Generation 1-equipped 2011 and 2012 vehicles <ref>[http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-new-sync-software-update-adds-35451 New SYNC Software Update Adds Bluetooth MAP Standard; Ford Poised to Give More Drivers Safer Texting Alternatives]</ref> and also by BMW with many of their iDrive systems. The Lexus LX and GS 2013 models both also support MAP as does the Honda CRV 2012, Acura 2013 and ILX 2013. Apple introduced Bluetooth MAP in iOS 6 for the iPhone and iPad. Android support was introduced in version 4.4 (KitKat).<ref>{{ cite web |  url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/10/31/kitkat-feature-spotlight-android-finally-supports-bluetooth-map-will-make-bluetooth-integration-with-your-car-suck-a-lot-less/ |  title = KitKat Feature Spotlight: Android Finally Supports Bluetooth MAP, Will Make Bluetooth Integration With Your Car Suck A Lot Less |  accessdate = 2013-11-02 |  publisher = Androidpolice.com }}</ref>\n\n== OBject EXchange (OBEX) ==\n{{main article|OBEX}}\n\n== Object Push Profile (OPP) ==\n\nA basic profile for sending \"objects\" such as pictures, [[VCard|virtual business cards]], or [[VCalendar|appointment details]]. It is called push because the transfers are always instigated by the sender (client), not the receiver (server).\n\nOPP uses the APIs of OBEX profile and the OBEX operations which are used in OPP are connect, disconnect, put, get and abort. By using these API the OPP layer will reside over OBEX and hence follow the specifications of the Bluetooth stack.\n\n== Personal Area Networking Profile (PAN) ==\n\nThis profile is intended to allow the use of Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol on [[Network layer firewall|Layer 3]] protocols for transport over a Bluetooth link.\n\n== Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP, PBA) ==\n\nPhone Book Access (PBA).<ref>[http://www.phonescoop.com/glossary/term.php?gid=323 PBA - Phone Book Access], Definition</ref><ref>[https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=230887 PBAP_SPEC_V11r00]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tainghebluetooth.com/tai-nghe-bluetooth-blueant|title=Tai nghe bluetooth Blueant|author=tainghebluetooth.com|work=tainghebluetooth.com}}</ref> or Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP) is a profile that allows exchange of Phone Book Objects between devices. It is likely to be used between a car kit and a mobile phone to:\n* allow the car kit to display the name of the incoming caller;\n* allow the car kit to download the phone book so the user can initiate a call from the car display.\n\nThe profile consists of two roles:\n* PSE - Phone Book Server Equipment for the side delivering phonebook data, like a mobile phone\n* PCE - Phone Book Client Equipment, for the device receiving this data, like a personal navigation device (PND)\n\n== Proximity Profile (PXP) ==\n\nThe Proximity profile (PXP) enables proximity monitoring between two devices.\n\n==  Serial Port Profile (SPP)  ==\n\nThis profile is based on [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]] 07.10 and the [[RFCOMM]] protocol. It emulates a serial cable to provide a simple substitute for existing [[RS-232]], including the familiar control signals. It is the basis for [[Dial-up networking|DUN]], [[FAX]], HSP and [[AVRCP]]. SPP maximum payload capacity is 128 bytes.\n\nSerial Port Profile defines how to set up virtual serial ports and connect two Bluetooth enabled devices.\n\n== Service Discovery Application Profile (SDAP) ==\n\nSDAP describes how an application should use SDP to discover services on a remote device. SDAP requires that any application be able to find out what services are available on any Bluetooth enabled device it connects to.\n\n== SIM Access Profile (SAP, SIM, rSAP) ==\n\nThis profile allows devices such as car phones with built-in [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] transceivers to connect to a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] in a Bluetooth enabled phone, thus the car phone itself doesn't require a separate SIM card. This profile is sometimes referred to as rSAP (remote-SIM-Access-Profile), though that name does not appear in the profile specification published by the [[Bluetooth SIG]]. Information on  phones that support SAP can be found below:\n\nCurrently the following cars by design can work with SIM-Access-Profile:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Manufacturer !!

As this profile originated as part of the [[Infrared Data Association|infrared]] specifications but has been adopted by the Bluetooth SIG to form part of the main Bluetooth specification, it is also commonly referred to as IrMC Synchronization.\n\n== Synchronisation Mark-up Language Profile (SyncML) ==\n\nFor Bluetooth, Synchronization is one of the most important areas. The Bluetooth specifications up to, and including 1.1, has Synchronization Profile that is based on IrMC. Later, many of the companies in the Bluetooth SIG already had proprietary synchronization solutions and they did not want to implement IrMC -based synchronization also, hence [[SyncML]] emerged. SyncML is an open industry initiative for common data synchronization protocol. The SyncML protocol has been developed by some of the leading companies in their sectors, Lotus, Motorola, Ericsson, Matsushita Communication Industrial Co., Nokia, IBM, Palm Inc., Psion and Starfish Software; together with over 600 SyncML Supporter companies. SyncML is a synchronization protocol that can be used by devices to communicate the changes that have taken place in the data that is stored within them. However, SyncML is capable of delivering more than just basic synchronization; it is extensible, providing powerful commands to allow searching and execution.\n\n== Video Distribution Profile (VDP) ==\n\nThis profile allows the transport of a video stream. It could be used for streaming a recorded video from a PC media center to a portable player, or a live video from a digital video camera to a TV. Support for the [[H.263]] baseline is mandatory. The [[MPEG-4]] Visual Simple Profile, and [[H.263]] profiles 3 and 8 are optionally supported, and covered in the specification.1\n\n== Wireless Application Protocol Bearer (WAPB) ==\n\nThis is a profile for carrying [[Wireless Application Protocol|Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)]] over [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] over Bluetooth.\n\n== Future profiles ==\n\nThese profiles are still not finalised, but are currently proposed within the Bluetooth SIG:\n* Unrestricted digital information (UDI)\n* Extended service discovery profile (ESDP)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n6_esdp.asp |website=www.palowireless.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007001447/http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/tutorial/n6_esdp.asp |archive-date=2013-10-07 |title=Extended Service Discovery Profile |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Video conferencing profile (VCP): This profile is to be compatible with [[3G-324M]], and support [[videoconferencing]] over a [[3G]] high-speed connection.\n* Tempow Audio Profile (TAP): this new audio profile was presented at Bluetooth World 2017 in Santa Clara.
