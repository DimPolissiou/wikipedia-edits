This is in part due to [[sexual dimorphism]], as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most subtypes. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation.

Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.<ref name=\"living\"/> Skull lengths of Russian brown bears tend to be {{Convert|31.5|to|45.5|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for males, and {{Convert|27.5|to|39.7|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for females.

The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> The teeth of brown bears reflect their dietary plasticity and are broadly similar to other bears, excluding the two most herbivorous living bears, the [[giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca'') and the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus''), which have blunt, small premolars (ideal for grinding down fibrous plants) compared to the jagged premolars of ursid bears that at least seasonally often rely on flesh as a food source.<ref name= Christiansen2>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jmor.10643|pmid=18488989|title=Feeding ecology and morphology of the upper canines in bears (carnivora: Ursidae)|journal=Journal of Morphology|volume=269|issue=#7|pages=896\u2013908|year=2008|last1=Christiansen|first1=Per}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kurt\u00e9n, B. |year=1966|title= Pleistocene bears of North America: Genus ''Tremarctos'', spectacled bears|journal=Acta Zoologica Fennica |volume=115|pages=1\u201396}}</ref> The teeth are reliably larger than [[American black bear]]s, but average smaller in molar length than [[polar bear]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=4819587|doi=10.2307/1379261|year=1974|last1=Slaughter|first1=B.

Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. A small population of brown bears (''[[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]'') still lives in central Italy (the [[Apennine Mountains]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Latium]]), with no more than 30-40 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.\n\nIn [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing.

The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nBeyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.<ref name=\"brown\"/> While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.<ref name=\"brown\"/> On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.<ref name=\"brown\"/> Large mammals preyed on can include various [[ungulate]] species such as [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[Muskox|muskoxen]] and [[wild boar]].<ref name= Smith/> When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S.

Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent.<ref name= Smith/> When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow.<ref name= Macdonald/> Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil.<ref name= Smith/> On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison.<ref name=\"brown\"/> They also feed on [[carrion]], and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as [[Wolf|wolves]], [[cougar]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[American black bear]]s from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprised by winter-killed big game.<ref name= Smith/> Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nWhen forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic [[cattle]] are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.<ref name= Smith/> Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[melon]]s and any form of [[Berry|berries]].<ref name=\"brown\"/> They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee farms]], readily consuming both honey and the contents of the [[honey bee]] colony.<ref name=\"brown\"/> Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers.

The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already-endangered subspecies. The grizzly bear is officially described as \"Threatened\" in the U.S.. Although the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gunther, K. A. |author2=Haroldson, M.

They are told to look for grizzly bear scat in camping areas and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly bear scat is difficult to differentiate from American black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.<ref name=\"attack\"/>\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[The Story of the Three Bears]]\", illustration from ''Childhood's Favorites and Fairy Stories'']]\nBrown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. \"[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]\" is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]\", a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of \"[[Snow White and Rose Red]]\"; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear.

This is in part due to [[sexual dimorphism]], as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most subtypes. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation.

Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.<ref name=\"living\"/> Skull lengths of Russian brown bears tend to be {{Convert|31.5|to|45.5|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for males, and {{Convert|27.5|to|39.7|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for females.

The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> The teeth of brown bears reflect their dietary plasticity and are broadly similar to other bears, excluding the two most herbivorous living bears, the [[giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca'') and the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus''), which have blunt, small premolars (ideal for grinding down fibrous plants) compared to the jagged premolars of ursid bears that at least seasonally often rely on flesh as a food source.<ref name= Christiansen2>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jmor.10643|pmid=18488989|title=Feeding ecology and morphology of the upper canines in bears (carnivora: Ursidae)|journal=Journal of Morphology|volume=269|issue=#7|pages=896\u2013908|year=2008|last1=Christiansen|first1=Per}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kurt\u00e9n, B. |year=1966|title= Pleistocene bears of North America: Genus ''Tremarctos'', spectacled bears|journal=Acta Zoologica Fennica |volume=115|pages=1\u201396}}</ref> The teeth are reliably larger than [[American black bear]]s, but average smaller in molar length than [[polar bear]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=4819587|doi=10.2307/1379261|year=1974|last1=Slaughter|first1=B.

Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. A small population of brown bears (''[[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]'') still lives in central Italy (the [[Apennine Mountains]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Latium]]), with no more than 30-40 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.\n\nIn [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing.

The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nBeyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.<ref name=\"brown\"/> While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.<ref name=\"brown\"/> On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.<ref name=\"brown\"/> Large mammals preyed on can include various [[ungulate]] species such as [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[Muskox|muskoxen]] and [[wild boar]].<ref name= Smith/> When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S.

Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent.<ref name= Smith/> When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow.<ref name= Macdonald/> Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil.<ref name= Smith/> On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison.<ref name=\"brown\"/> They also feed on [[carrion]], and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as [[Wolf|wolves]], [[cougar]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[American black bear]]s from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprised by winter-killed big game.<ref name= Smith/> Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nWhen forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic [[cattle]] are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.<ref name= Smith/> Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[melon]]s and any form of [[Berry|berries]].<ref name=\"brown\"/> They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee farms]], readily consuming both honey and the contents of the [[honey bee]] colony.<ref name=\"brown\"/> Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers.

The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already-endangered subspecies. The grizzly bear is officially described as \"Threatened\" in the U.S.. Although the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gunther, K. A. |author2=Haroldson, M.

They are told to look for grizzly bear scat in camping areas and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly bear scat is difficult to differentiate from American black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.<ref name=\"attack\"/>\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[The Story of the Three Bears]]\", illustration from ''Childhood's Favorites and Fairy Stories'']]\nBrown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. \"[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]\" is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]\", a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of \"[[Snow White and Rose Red]]\"; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book ''[[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]]'' to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Newman, A.
