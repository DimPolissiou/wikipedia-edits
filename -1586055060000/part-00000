a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Mahoning County, Ohio|Mahoning County]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], Youngstown had a city proper population of 66,982, making it the [[List of cities in Ohio|9th-largest city]] in Ohio. Youngstown is the mainstay of the [[Mahoning Valley|Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], with a population of 565,773; this makes it the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|105th-largest metropolitan area in the United States]], and the 7th-largest in Ohio.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ohio Metropolitan & Micropolitan Statistical Areas |url=https://ohio.hometownlocator.com/cities/msa/ |website=Ohio Hometown Locator |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nYoungstown is on the [[Mahoning River]], approximately {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and {{convert|61|mi|km|-2}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Despite having its own media market, Youngstown is often included in commercial and cultural depictions of both [[Northeast Ohio]] as well as the [[Greater Pittsburgh Region]] due to these proximities. Youngstown is also the midway between [[New York City]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]] via [[Interstate 80]]. \n\nThe city was named for [[John Young (pioneer)|John Young]], an early settler from [[Whitestown, New York]], who established the community's first [[sawmill]] and [[gristmill]]. Youngstown is a [[midwestern]] city, falling within a region of America often referred to as the [[Rust Belt]]. Traditionally known as a center of steel production, Youngstown was forced to redefine itself when the U.S. steel industry fell into decline in the 1970s, leaving communities throughout the region without major industry. The city has experienced a decline of over 60% of its population since 1959. Youngstown falls within the [[Appalachian Ohio]] region, among the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].\n\n[[Downtown Youngstown]] has seen tremendous change within the last several years, becoming a center of culture, entertainment and innovation. It is now home to bars, restaurants, and the recently completed [[Youngstown Amphitheatre|Youngstown Foundation Amphitheater]]. Youngstown's first new downtown hotel since 1974\u2014the [[DoubleTree by Hilton]]\u2014opened in 2018 in the historic Stambaugh Building with first floor commercial space including a restaurant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glaser |first1=Susan |title=Downtown Youngstown gets first hotel in 44 years, a DoubleTree by Hilton |url=https://www.cleveland.com/travel/2018/06/youngstown_gets_first_new_hote.html |website=Cleveland.com |accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> Several businesses, such as [[Turning Technologies]], an education technology company are headquartered in Downtown Youngstown.

The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 33\u201335.</ref> Local industrialist [[David Tod]], who became Ohio governor during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], persuaded [[Lake Erie]] steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland.

(1995), pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\n[[File:YoungstownOhio1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Youngstown, 1910s: Central Square and Viaduct (view looking south)]]\nYoungstown's industrial development changed the face of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from [[Wales]], Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 69.</ref> In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day [[Lebanon]], Palestine/Israel, and [[Syria]].\n\nBy the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity.<ref>Jenkins (1990), p. 19.</ref> The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] Americans in neighboring [[Niles, Ohio|Niles]] led Ohio Governor [[A.

Stewart]] was the second African American elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].<ref>Aley (1975), p. 47.</ref> A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national [[Steel Strike of 1919]], local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the [[Southern United States|South]], many of whom were Black.<ref>Brody (1960), pp. 254\u2013255.</ref> This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace.<ref>Bruno (1999), pp. 155\u2013156.</ref><ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), p. 42.</ref> Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative [[sharecropping]] system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.<ref>Lemann (1991), pp. 3\u201358.</ref>\n\nYoungstown's local iron ore deposits were exhausted by the early 20th century.\nSince the city is landlocked (the Mahoning River is not navigable), ore from Michigan and\nMinnesota had to arrive by rail from Cleveland and other Great Lakes\nport cities where large bulk carriers were unloaded. This put Youngstown at\na competitive disadvantage to the iron and steel producers in Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago and Detroit\u2014all on Great Lake shores. Compared to these four cities, Youngstown had a higher cost of transporting raw materials to the mills, according to a Harvard Business Review report published in January 1933. Higher transportation costs are one reason why Youngstown mills began their decline before those in other \"rust belt\" cities.<ref name=\"Transport costs\">{{cite journal |date=December 1, 1935 |title=Republic II: Corrigan, McKinney |journal=Fortune |volume=XII |page=142}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\nThe city's population became more diverse after the end of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In the 1950s, the [[Hispanics in the United States|Latino]] population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, [[St. Rose of Lima]] Roman Catholic Church and the First Spanish [[Baptist]] Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area.<ref name=\"Aley46\"/> While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s.

a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Mahoning County, Ohio|Mahoning County]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], Youngstown had a city proper population of 66,982, making it the [[List of cities in Ohio|9th-largest city]] in Ohio. Youngstown is the mainstay of the [[Mahoning Valley|Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], with a population of 565,773; this makes it the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|105th-largest metropolitan area in the United States]], and the 7th-largest in Ohio.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ohio Metropolitan & Micropolitan Statistical Areas |url=https://ohio.hometownlocator.com/cities/msa/ |website=Ohio Hometown Locator |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nYoungstown is on the [[Mahoning River]], approximately {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and {{convert|61|mi|km|-2}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Despite having its own media market, Youngstown is often included in commercial and cultural depictions of both [[Northeast Ohio]] as well as the [[Greater Pittsburgh Region]] due to these proximities. Youngstown is also the midway between [[New York City]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]] via [[Interstate 80]]. \n\nThe city was named for [[John Young (pioneer)|John Young]], an early settler from [[Whitestown, New York]], who established the community's first [[sawmill]] and [[gristmill]]. Youngstown is a [[midwestern]] city, falling within a region of America often referred to as the [[Rust Belt]]. Traditionally known as a center of steel production, Youngstown was forced to redefine itself when the U.S. steel industry fell into decline in the 1970s, leaving communities throughout the region without major industry. The city has experienced a decline of over 60% of its population since 1959. Youngstown falls within the [[Appalachian Ohio]] region, among the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].\n\n[[Downtown Youngstown]] has seen tremendous change within the last several years, becoming a center of culture, entertainment and innovation. It is now home to bars, restaurants, and the recently completed [[Youngstown Amphitheatre|Youngstown Foundation Amphitheater]]. Youngstown's first new downtown hotel since 1974\u2014the [[DoubleTree by Hilton]]\u2014opened in 2018 in the historic Stambaugh Building with first floor commercial space including a restaurant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glaser |first1=Susan |title=Downtown Youngstown gets first hotel in 44 years, a DoubleTree by Hilton |url=https://www.cleveland.com/travel/2018/06/youngstown_gets_first_new_hote.html |website=Cleveland.com |accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> Several businesses, such as [[Turning Technologies]], an education technology company are headquartered in Downtown Youngstown.

In 1800, territorial governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] established Trumbull County (named in honor of Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]]), and designated the smaller settlement of Warren as its administrative center, or \"[[county seat]]\".<ref>Blue ''et al.''

The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 33\u201335.</ref> Local industrialist [[David Tod]], who became Ohio governor during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], persuaded [[Lake Erie]] steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The railroad's arrival in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\n[[File:YoungstownOhio1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Youngstown, 1910s: Central Square and Viaduct (view looking south)]]\nYoungstown's industrial development changed the face of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from [[Wales]], Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 69.</ref> In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day [[Lebanon]], Palestine/Israel, and [[Syria]].\n\nBy the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity.<ref>Jenkins (1990), p. 19.</ref> The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] Americans in neighboring [[Niles, Ohio|Niles]] led Ohio Governor [[A. Victor Donahey]] to declare martial law.<ref>Jenkins (1990), p. 137.</ref> By 1928 the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.<ref>Aley (1975), p. 259.</ref> Despite the prevalence of Irish Americans in Youngstown, their presence wasn't always evident. When radio personality Pete Gabriel (who was Greek), came to Youngstown, he found out at the time that there was no St Patrick's Day parade there, so he started one.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas is a time of celebration, joy and inclusion |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2014/christmas-is-a-time-of-celebration-joy-and-inclusion.cfm |website=CSN News |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of industry attracted people from within the United States and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] was established in 1871.<ref name=\"Aley46\">Aley (1975), p. 46.</ref> In the 1880s, local attorney [[William R. Stewart]] was the second African American elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].<ref>Aley (1975), p. 47.</ref> A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national [[Steel Strike of 1919]], local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the [[Southern United States|South]], many of whom were Black.<ref>Brody (1960), pp. 254\u2013255.</ref> This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace.<ref>Bruno (1999), pp. 155\u2013156.</ref><ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), p. 42.</ref> Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative [[sharecropping]] system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.<ref>Lemann (1991), pp. 3\u201358.</ref>\n\nYoungstown's local iron ore deposits were exhausted by the early 20th century.\nSince the city is landlocked (the Mahoning River is not navigable), ore from Michigan and\nMinnesota had to arrive by rail from Cleveland and other Great Lakes\nport cities where large bulk carriers were unloaded. This put Youngstown at\na competitive disadvantage to the iron and steel producers in Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago and Detroit\u2014all on Great Lake shores. Compared to these four cities, Youngstown had a higher cost of transporting raw materials to the mills, according to a Harvard Business Review report published in January 1933. Higher transportation costs are one reason why Youngstown mills began their decline before those in other \"rust belt\" cities.<ref name=\"Transport costs\">{{cite journal |date=December 1, 1935 |title=Republic II: Corrigan, McKinney |journal=Fortune |volume=XII |page=142}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\nThe city's population became more diverse after the end of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In the 1950s, the [[Hispanics in the United States|Latino]] population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, [[St. Rose of Lima]] Roman Catholic Church and the First Spanish [[Baptist]] Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area.<ref name=\"Aley46\"/> While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s.

All other YSU athletic teams compete in the [[Horizon League]], which does not sponsor football. The Youngstown State men and women's basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State's [[Beeghly Center]]. The teams average about 2,500 fans per game, a number that has been on the rise the past two seasons with a new style of play under Head Coach [[Jerry Slocum]]. In addition, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed local support and success. The baseball team reached the NCAA super-regionals in 2005, and the softball team did so in 2006.<ref name=\"ysusports\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ysusports.com/landing/index |title=YSU Sports Homepage |publisher=Youngstown State University |accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Hockey ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Club\n! scope=\"col\" | League\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Established\n! scope=\"col\" | Championships\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" | [[Youngstown Phantoms]]\n| [[United States Hockey League|USHL]], Ice hockey\n| [[Covelli Centre]]\n| 2003\n| 1\n|}\n\nThe Covelli Centre (formally the Chevrolet Centre) was the home of the [[Youngstown SteelHounds]] hockey team that played in the [[Central Hockey League]] until May 2008.

The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]]. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Area 51|UFO conspiracy theory|Bob Lazar}}\n[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|[[Warning sign]] near Area 51 (2003)|alt=]]\nArea 51 has been the subject of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding the presence of aliens on the site.

51 Raid''', was an American [[Facebook event]] that took place on September 20, 2019, at [[Area 51]], a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) facility within the [[Nevada Test and Training Range]]. The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]]. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Area 51|UFO conspiracy theory|Bob Lazar}}\n[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|[[Warning sign]] near Area 51 (2003)|alt=]]\nArea 51 has been the subject of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding the presence of aliens on the site.
