The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the [[Holy Land]], which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of [[Roman Catholic]]s, while Russia promoted those of the [[Western Orthodox Church]]. The longer-term causes involved the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire's expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key,<ref>[https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/crimean-war The Crimean War. Richard Cavendish. Published in History Today, Volume 54, Issue 3, March 2004, Retrieved 12 August 2019]</ref> have never revealed a \"greater confusion of purpose\", yet they led to a war noted for its \"notoriously incompetent international butchery\".{{sfn|Troubetzkoy|2006|p=208}}\n\nWhile the churches worked out their differences and [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|came to an agreement]], [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to. When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement, Nicholas recanted and prepared for war. Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain, the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853.\n\nThe war started in the [[Balkans]] in July 1842, when Russian troops occupied the [[Danubian Principalities]]<ref name=\"EB\">{{Britannica|143040}}</ref> (now part of [[Romania]]), which were under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], then began to cross the [[Danube]]. Led by [[Omar Pasha]], the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at [[Silistra]]. A separate action on the fort town of [[Kars]] in eastern Anatolia led to a siege, and a Turkish attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a Russian fleet at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]]. Fearing an Ottoman collapse, France and Britain rushed forces to [[Gallipoli]]. They then moved north to [[Varna]] in June 1854, arriving just in time for the Russians to abandon Silistra. Aside from a minor skirmish at [[Constan\u021ba|K\u00f6stence]] (today Constan\u021ba), there was little for the allies to do. [[Karl Marx]] quipped, \"there they are, the French doing nothing and the British helping them as fast as possible\".{{sfn|Troubetzkoy|2006|p=192}}\n\nFrustrated by the wasted effort, and with demands for action from their citizens, the allied force decided to attack Russia's main naval base in the [[Black Sea]] at [[Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]]. After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and marched their way to a point south of Sevastopol after the successful [[Battle of the Alma]]. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the [[Battle of Balaclava]] and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, at [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], ended in stalemate. The front settled into a siege and led to brutal conditions for troops on both sides. Smaller military actions took place in the [[Baltic coast|Baltic]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[White Sea]], and the [[North Pacific]].\n\nSevastopol fell after eleven months, and neutral countries began to join the Allied cause. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, Russia [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]] in March 1856. France and Britain welcomed this development, as the conflict was growing unpopular at home. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war. It forbade Russia from basing warships in the [[Black Sea]]. The Ottoman [[vassal state]]s of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] became largely independent. Christians there were granted a degree of official equality, and the Orthodox Church regained control of the Christian churches in dispute.<ref name=\"Figes2010\">{{cite book |last= Figes |first= Orlando |title= Crimea: The Last Crusade |year= 2010 |location= London |publisher= Allen Lane |isbn= 978-0-7139-9704-0 }}</ref>{{rp|415}}\n\nThe Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], railways, and [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]].<ref name=\"Royle2000\">{{cite book |last= Royle |first= Trevor |title= Crimea: The Great Crimean War, 1854\u20131856 |year= 2000 |location= |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-1-4039-6416-8 }}</ref>{{rp|at= Preface}} The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and [[war photography|photographs]]. As the legend of the \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]\" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and [[management|mismanagement]]. The reaction in Britain was a demand for professionalisation, most famously achieved by [[Florence Nightingale]], who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while treating the wounded.\n\nThe Crimean War proved to be the moment of truth for Russia.  The war weakened the army, drained the treasury and undermined Russia's influence in Europe. It would take decades to recover. The humiliation forced Russia's educated elites to identify the Empire's problems and to recognize the need for fundamental reforms. They saw rapid modernization of the country as the sole way of it recovering the status of a European power. The war thus was a catalyst for the reforms of Russia's social institutions, including [[serfdom]], justice, local self-government, education, and military service. More recently, scholars have also turned their attention to the impact of the Crimean War on the development of Russian nationalistic discourse.\n\n==The \"Eastern Question\"==\n{{see also|Eastern Question}} \nAs the Ottoman Empire [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|steadily weakened]] during the 19th century, Russia stood poised to take advantage by expanding south. In the 1850s, the [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom|British]] and the French, who were allied with the Ottoman Empire, were determined not to allow this to happen.<ref>Matthew Smith Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774\u20131923: A Study in International Relations'' (1966).</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2019}}\n[[A.

Neither Nicholas I nor Napoleon III nor the British government could retreat in the conflict for prestige once it was launched.

The [[Serbian Revolution]] in 1804 resulted in the self-liberation of the first [[Balkan]] Christian nation under the Ottoman Empire. The [[Greek War of Independence]], which began in early 1821, provided further evidence of the internal and military weakness of the Ottoman Empire, and the commission of atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see [[Chios massacre]]) further undermined the Ottomans. The disbandment of the centuries-old [[Janissaries|Janissary]] corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 ([[Auspicious Incident]]) helped the Ottoman Empire in the longer term, but in the short term it deprived the country of its existing standing army.{{clarify|date=February 2017}} In 1828, the allied Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all the Ottoman naval forces during the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1830, Greece became an independent state after 10 years of war and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)]]. According to the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|1829 Treaty of Adrianople]], Russian and Western European commercial ships were authorized to freely pass through the [[Dardanelles|Black Sea straits]], Serbia received autonomy, and the Danubian Principalities ([[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]) became territories under Russian protection.\n\n[[File:Navarino-A L Garneray.jpg|thumb|left|Naval [[Battle of Navarino]], 1827]]\n\nFrance took the opportunity to [[French conquest of Algeria|occupy Algeria]] in 1830. In 1831 [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who was the most powerful [[vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire, claimed independence. Ottoman forces were [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|defeated in a number of battles]], and the Egyptians were ready to capture [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], which forced Sultan [[Mahmud II]] to seek Russian military aid. A Russian army of 10,000 landed on the [[Bosphorus]] shores in 1833 and helped to prevent the capture of Constantinople. As a result, the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi|Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]] was signed, benefiting Russia greatly. It provided for a military alliance between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, if one of them were to be attacked, and a secret additional clause allowed the Ottomans to opt out of sending troops but to close the Straits to foreign warships if Russia was under threat. Egypt remained under nominal Ottoman sovereignty, although it was de facto independent:\n\nIn 1838 the situation was similar to 1831. Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about his lack of control and power in [[Syria]], and he [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|resumed military action]]. The [[Ottoman Army]] lost to the Egyptians at the [[Battle of Nezib]] on 24 June 1839. The Ottoman Empire was saved by Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, who signed a convention in London on 15 July 1840 granting Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian armed forces from Syria and [[Lebanon]]. Moreover, Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence to the Ottoman sultan. After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention, the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blockaded the [[Nile Delta]], bombarded [[Beirut]] and captured [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840.\n\nOn 13 July 1841, after the expiry of the [[Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]], the [[London Straits Convention]] was signed under pressure from European countries. The new treaty deprived Russia of its right to block warships from passing into the Black Sea in case of war. Thus the way to the Black Sea was open for British and French warships in case of a possible Russo-Ottoman conflict.\n\nIt must be said that this fact confirms the statements of Russian historians about the absence of aggressive plans of Russia. Russian historian writes: \"The signing of the documents was the result of deliberate decisions: instead of bilateral (none of the great powers recognized this Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi), the new Treaty of London was obligatory for all, it closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\" <ref>Vinogradov V.N. Lord Palmerston in European diplomacy. New and recent history. 2006.No. 5.</ref>\n\nAssistance from [[Western Europe]]an powers had twice saved the Ottoman Empire from destruction, but the Ottomans had now lost their independence in foreign policy. Britain and France desired more than any other states to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire because they did not want to see Russia gaining access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Austria had fears for the same reasons.

Along with the additional 5 battle ships, in the [[Battle of Sinop]] on 30 November 1853, they destroyed a patrol squadron of 11 Ottoman battle ships while they were anchored in port under defense of the onshore artillery garrison.

In the centre, the Russian forces crossed the Danube and laid [[Siege of Silistra|siege to Silistra]] from 14 April with 60,000 troops, the defenders with 15,000 had supplies for three months.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|415}} The siege was lifted on 23 June 1854.<ref>{{cite book|author=James J.

On 28 May 1854 a protocol of the Vienna Conference was signed by Austria and Russia. One of the aims of the Russian advance had been to encourage the Orthodox Christian [[Serbs]] and [[Bulgarians]] living under Ottoman rule to rebel. When the Russian troops crossed the River Pruth into Moldavia, the Orthodox Christians showed no interest in rising up against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|131, 137}} Adding to the worries of Nicholas I was the concern that Austria would enter the war against the Russians and attack his armies on the western flank. Indeed, after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between Russia and Ottoman Empire, the Austrians entered the war on the side of the Ottomans with an attack against the Russians in the Principalities which threatened to cut off the Russian supply lines. Accordingly, the Russians were forced to raise the siege of Silistra on 23 June 1854, and begin abandoning the Principalities.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|185}} The lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a Russian advance into Bulgaria.\n\nIn June 1854, the Allied expeditionary force landed at [[Varna]], a city on the Black Sea's western coast. They made little advance from their base there.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|175\u201376}} In July 1854, the Ottomans under Omar Pasha crossed the Danube into Wallachia and on 7 July 1854 engaged the Russians in the city of [[Giurgiu]] and conquered it. The capture of Giurgiu by the Ottomans immediately threatened Bucharest in Wallachia with capture by the same Ottoman army. On 26 July 1854, Tsar Nicholas I, responding to an Austrian ultimatum, ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Principalities. Also, in late July 1854, following up on the Russian retreat, the French staged an expedition against the Russian forces still in Dobruja, but this was a failure.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|188\u201390}}\n\nBy then, the Russian withdrawal was complete, except for the fortress towns of northern Dobruja, while their place in the Principalities was taken by the Austrians, as a neutral peacekeeping force.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|189}} There was little further action on this front after late 1854, and in September the allied force boarded ships at Varna to invade the [[Crimean Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|198}}\n\n===Black Sea theatre===\n[[File:Turkish troops storming Fort Shefketil (cropped).jpg|thumb|Turkish troops storming [[Shekvetili|Fort Shefketil]]]]\n\nThe naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch, in mid-1853, of the French and British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment. By June 1853, both fleets were stationed at [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besikas Bay]], outside the [[Dardanelles]]. With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in October, they moved to the [[Bosphorus]] and in November entered the Black Sea.\n\nDuring this period, the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] was operating against Ottoman coastal traffic between Constantinople and the Caucasus ports, while the Ottoman fleet sought to protect this supply line. The clash came on 30 November 1853 when a Russian fleet attacked an Ottoman force in the harbour at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], and destroyed it at the [[Battle of Sinop]]. The battle outraged opinion in UK, which called for war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Guy|title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&pg=PR95|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=95|isbn=9780810866133}}</ref> There was little additional naval action until March 1854 when on the declaration of war the British frigate HMS ''Furious'' was fired on outside [[Odessa]] Harbour. In response an Anglo-French fleet [[Bombardment of Odessa|bombarded the port]], causing much damage to the town. To show support for Turkey after the battle of Sinop, on 22 December 1853, the Anglo-French squadron entered the Black Sea and the steamship HMS ''Retribution'' approached the [[Port of Sevastopol]], the commander of which received an ultimatum not to allow any ships in the Black Sea.\n\nIn June, the fleets transported the Allied expeditionary forces to [[Varna]], in support of the Ottoman operations on the Danube; in September they again transported the armies, this time to the Crimea. The Russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies, preferring to maintain a \"[[fleet in being]]\"; this strategy failed when Sevastopol, the main port and where most of the Black Sea fleet was based, came under siege. The Russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as [[blockship]]s, after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore. During the siege, the Russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], twelve 84-gun two-deckers and four 60-gun [[frigate]]s in the Black Sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels. During the rest of the campaign the allied fleets remained in control of the Black Sea, ensuring the various fronts were kept supplied.\n\nIn May 1855, the allies successfully invaded  [[Kerch]] and operated against [[Siege of Taganrog|Taganrog]] in the [[Sea of Azov]]. In September they moved against Russian installations in the [[Dnieper]] estuary, [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|attacking Kinburn]] in the first use of [[ironclad]] ships in naval warfare.\n\n===Crimean campaign===\n[[File:Russo-British skirmish during Crimean War.png|thumb|upright|Russo-British skirmish during the Crimean War]]\n\nThe Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854. With the evacuation of the Danubian Principalities, the immediate cause of war was withdrawn and the war might have ended at this time.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|192}} However, war fever among the public in both the UK and France had been whipped up by the press in both countries to the degree that politicians found it untenable to propose ending the war at this point. The coalition government of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]] fell on 30 January 1855 on a no-confidence vote as Parliament voted to appoint a committee to investigate mismanagement of the war.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|311}}\n\nFrench and British officers and engineers were sent on 20 July on HMS ''Fury'', a wooden Bulldog-class paddle sloop, to survey the harbour of Sevastopol and the coast near it, managing to get close to the harbour mouth to inspect the formidable batteries. Returning, they reported that they believed there were 15,000\u201320,000 troops encamped.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|421}} Ships were prepared to transport horses and siege equipment was both manufactured and imported.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|422}}\n\nThe Crimean campaign opened in September 1854.

The landing surprised the Russians, as they had expected a landing at [[Kacha, Sevastopol|Katcha]]; the last-minute change proving that Russia had known the original campaign plan. There was no sign of the enemy and the invading troops all landed on 14 September 1854. It took another four days to land all the stores, equipment, horses and artillery.\n\n[[File:Battle of Alma Sutherland highlanders.png|thumb|left|[[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|93rd Sutherland Highlanders]] at the Battle of Alma]]\n\nThe landing took place north of Sevastopol, so the Russians had arrayed their army in expectation of a direct attack. The allies advanced and on the morning of 20 September came up to the River Alma and engaged the Russian army. The position was strong, but after three hours,<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|424}} the allied frontal attack had driven the Russians out of their dug-in positions with losses of 6,000 men. The [[Battle of the Alma]] resulted in 3,300 Allied losses. Failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many strategic errors made during the war, and the Russians themselves noted that had the Allies pressed south that day they would have easily captured Sevastopol.\n \nBelieving the northern approaches to the city too well defended, especially due to the presence of a large [[star fort]] and because Sevastopol was on the south side of [[Sevastopol Bay|the inlet from the sea that made the harbour]], Sir [[John Fox Burgoyne|John Burgoyne]], the engineer advisor, recommended that the allies attack Sevastopol from the south. The joint commanders, [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Raglan]] and [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|St Arnaud]], agreed.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|426}} On 25 September the whole army began to march southeast and encircled the city from the south, after establishing port facilities at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] for the British and at [[Kamiesch]] ({{lang-ru | \u041a\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0445\u0442\u0430 | translit = Kamyshovaya bukhta}}) for the French.

The British bombardment worked better than that of the French, who had smaller-calibre guns. The fleet suffered high casualties during the day. The British wanted to attack that afternoon, but the French wanted to defer the attack. A postponement was agreed, but on the next day the French were still not ready. By 19 October the Russians had transferred some heavy guns to the southern defences and outgunned the allies.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|431}}\n\nReinforcements for the Russians gave them the courage to send out probing attacks. The Allied lines, beginning to suffer from cholera as early as September, were stretched. The French, on the west had less to do than the British on the east with their siege lines and the large nine-mile open wing back to their supply base on the south coast.\n\n===Battle of Balaclava===\n{{Main|Battle of Balaclava}}\n[[File:Relief of the Light Brigade.png|thumb|British cavalry charging against Russian forces at Balaclava]]\n\nA large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.{{rp|521\u201327}} The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units. At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the [[93rd&nbsp;Highlanders]], who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]]. Rather than \"[[Infantry square|form square]]\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line, two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie rifles]], with which his troops were armed, at the Battle of Alma a month before, and he was confident his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded.<ref>Greenwood, ch. 8</ref> From up on the ridge to the west, ''[[The Times|Times]]'' correspondent [[William Howard Russell]] saw the Highlanders as a \"thin red streak topped with steel\", a phrase which soon became the \"[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|Thin Red Line]]\".<ref>John Millin Selby, ''The thin red line of Balaclava'' (London: Hamilton, 1970)</ref>\n\n[[File:Chasseurs d'Afrique \u00e0 Balaclava.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]], led by General [[Armand-Octave-Marie d'Allonville|d'Allonville]], clearing Russian artillery from the Fedyukhin Heights during the Battle of Balaclava]]\n\nSoon after, a Russian cavalry movement was countered by the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade|Heavy Brigade]], who charged and fought hand-to-hand until the Russians retreated. This caused a more widespread Russian retreat, including a number of their artillery units. When the local commanders failed to take advantage of the retreat, Lord Raglan sent out orders to move up and prevent the withdrawal of naval guns from the recently captured redoubts on the heights. Raglan could see these guns due to his position on the hill; when in the valley, this view was obstructed, leaving the wrong guns in sight. The local commanders ignored the demands, leading to the British [[aide-de-camp]] (Captain Nolan) personally delivering the quickly written and confusing order to attack the artillery. When Lord Lucan questioned which guns the order referred to, the aide-de-camp pointed to the first Russian battery he could see and allegedly said \"There is your enemy, there are your guns\"\u2014due to his obstructed view, these were the wrong ones. Lucan then passed the order to the Earl of Cardigan, resulting in the [[charge of the Light Brigade]].\n\nIn this charge, Cardigan formed up his unit and charged the length of the Valley of the Balaclava, under fire from Russian batteries in the hills. The charge of the Light Brigade caused 278 casualties of the 700-man unit. The Light Brigade was memorialised in the famous poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\". Although traditionally the charge of the Light Brigade was looked upon as a glorious but wasted sacrifice of good men and horses, recent historians say that the charge of the Light Brigade did succeed in at least some of its objectives.<ref>John Sweetman, ''Balaclava 1854: The charge of the light brigade'' (Osprey Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?&id=fr7FjlzvrfwC excerpt]</ref> The aim of any cavalry charge is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off the battlefield. The charge of the Light Brigade so unnerved the Russian cavalry, which had been routed by the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade|Heavy Brigade]], that the Russians were set to full-scale flight.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|252}}<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Crimean War|last = Small|first = Hugh|year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe shortage of men led to the failure of the British and French to follow up on the Battle of Balaclava, which led directly to a much bloodier battle\u2014the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. On 5 November 1854, the Russians attempted to raise the siege at Sevastopol with an attack against the allies, which resulted in another allied victory.<ref>Patrick Mercer, ''Inkerman 1854: The Soldiers' Battle'' (1998) </ref>\n\n===The winter of 1854\u201355===\n[[File:Weller Siege of Sebastopol 1854-1855.jpg|thumb|Historical map showing the territory between Balaclava and Sevastopol at the time of the Siege of Sevastopol]]\n\nWinter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and [[materiel]] on both sides led to a halt in ground operations. Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, while the allied armies were hemmed in by the Russian Army in the interior. On 14 November the \"[[Great Storm of 1854|Balaklava Storm]]\" sank thirty allied transport ships,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_crimean.html|title=Crimean War, 1853\u20131856|work=historyofwar.org|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> including {{HMS|Prince|1854|6}}, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|435}} The storm and heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to disintegrate into a quagmire, requiring engineers to devote most of their time to its repair including quarrying stone. A [[Plateway|tramway]] was ordered. It arrived in January with a civilian engineering crew, but it was March before it was sufficiently advanced to be of any appreciable value.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|439}} An [[electrical telegraph]] was also ordered, but the frozen ground delayed its installation until March, when communications from the base port of Balaklava to the British HQ was established. The [[pipe-and-cable-laying plough]] failed because of the hard frozen soil, but nevertheless 21 miles of cable were laid.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|449}}\n\nThe troops suffered greatly from cold and sickness, and the shortage of fuel led them to start dismantling their defensive [[Gabion]]s and [[Fascine]]s.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|442}} In February 1855, the Russians attacked the allied base at Eupatoria, where an Ottoman army had built up and was threatening Russian supply routes.

Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.\n\nIn April 1855, the allies staged a second all-out bombardment, leading to an artillery duel with the Russian guns, but no ground assault followed.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|340\u201341}}\n\nOn 24 May 1855, sixty ships containing 7,000 French, 5,000 Turkish and 3,000 British troops set off for a raid on the city of [[Kerch]] east of Sevastopol in an attempt to open another front on the Crimean peninsula and to cut off Russian supplies.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|344}} When the allies landed the force at [[Kerch]], the plan was to outflank the [[Russian Army]].

There is a legend that the assault was scheduled for this date in favour of Napoleon III in the 40th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. This legend is not confirmed by historians.<ref>Tarle E.V. Crimean war. \u041c.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2, p.367</ref> But undoubtedly the appearance of such a legend is symptomatic, if we remember that the war in France was understood as a certain revanche for the defeat of 1812.\n\nIn June, a third bombardment was followed after two days by a successful attack on the Mamelon, but a follow-up assault on the Malakoff failed with heavy losses. During this time the garrison commander, [[Pavel Nakhimov|Admiral Nakhimov]] fell on 30 June 1855,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|378}} and Raglan died on 28 June.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|460}} Losses in these battles were so great that by agreement of military opponents short-term truces for removal of corpses were signed (these truces were described in the work Of Leo Tolstoy \"Sevastopol sketches\"). The assault was beaten back with heavy casualties and it was an undoubted victory of Russia. It is worth mentioning that the Russian [[Siege of Sevastopol (panorama)]] depicts the moment of the assault of Sevastopol on June 18, 1855.\n\nIn August, the Russians again made an attack towards the base at Balaclava, defended by the French, newly arrived Sardinian, and Ottoman troops.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|461}} The resulting [[Battle of the Chernaya]] was a defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy casualties.\n\n[[File:Vernet - La prise de Malakoff.jpg|thumb|upright|The French captured Sevastopol after a nearly year-long siege.]]\n\nFor months each side had been building forward rifle pits and defensive positions, which resulted in many skirmishes.

The Russians failed to retake it and their defences collapsed. Meanwhile, the British assaulted the [[Battle of the Great Redan|Great Redan]], a Russian defensive battlement just south of the city of Sevastopol\u2014a position that had been attacked repeatedly for months. Whether the British captured the Redan remains in dispute: Russian historians recognize only the loss of the Malakhov Kurgan (a key point of defence), claiming that all other positions were retained.<ref>Tarle E.V. Crimean war. \u041c.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2 p.462</ref> What is agreed is that the Russians abandoned the positions, blowing up their powder magazines and retreating to the north.

On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the [[Kerch Strait]] and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay. Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov. Except for [[Rostov]] and [[Azov]], no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight. This Allied campaign led to a significant reduction in supplies flowing to the besieged Russian troops at Sevastopol.\n\nOn 21 May 1855, the [[gunboat]]s and armed steamers attacked the seaport of [[Taganrog]], the most important hub near [[Rostov on Don]]. The vast amounts of food, especially bread, wheat, barley and rye that were amassed in the city after the outbreak of war were prevented from being exported.\n\nThe [[Governor of Taganrog]], [[Yegor Tolstoy]], and lieutenant-general [[Ivan Krasnov]] refused an allied ultimatum, responding that \"Russians never surrender their cities\". The Anglo\u2013French squadron bombarded [[Taganrog]] for 6{{frac|2}}&nbsp;hours and landed 300 troops near the [[Depaldo stone stairs|Old Stairway]] in the centre of Taganrog, but they were thrown back by [[Don Cossacks]] and a volunteer corps.\n\nIn July 1855, the allied squadron tried to go past Taganrog to [[Rostov-on-Don]], entering the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]] through the [[Mius River]]. On 12 July 1855 HMS&nbsp;''Jasper'' grounded near Taganrog thanks to a fisherman who moved [[buoy]]s into shallow water. The [[Cossacks]] captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up. The third siege attempt was made 19\u201331 August 1855, but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations.

Perhaps because of better communications western events sometimes influenced the east. The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] coast. Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky and few fought aggressively.<ref>This section summarizes [[William Edward David Allen]] and Paul Muratoff, ''Caucasian Battlefields'', 1953, Book II</ref>\n\n'''1853:''' There were four main events. 1. In the north the Turks captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack (27/28 October). They then pushed about 20,000 troops across the [[Choloki River|River Cholok]] border. Being outnumbered, the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to Marani. Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months. 2. In the centre the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements (13 November). The Russians routed them. The claimed losses were 4,000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about 30,000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at [[Gyumri]] or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town. Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped. The Turks failed to press their advantage; the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1,000 men out of 5,000. The Russians now decided to advance. The Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked. They were defeated in the [[Battle of Ba\u015fgedikler]], losing 6,000 men, half their artillery and all their supply train. The Russians lost 1,300, including Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnapped by [[Imam Shamil]] at [[Tsinandali]]. 4. At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinope]].\n\n'''1854:''' The British and French declared war on 3 January. Early in the year the Anglo-French fleet appeared in the Black Sea and the Russians abandoned the Black Sea Defensive Line from Anapa south. N. A. Read, who replaced Vorontsov, fearing an Anglo-French landing in conjunction with [[Shamil, 3rd Imam of Dagestan]] and the [[Persia]]ns, recommended withdrawal north of the Caucasus. For this he was replaced by Baryatinsky. When the allies chose a land attack on Sebastopol any plan for a landing in the east was abandoned.\n\nIn the north Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, retired behind the Cholok River and suspended action for the rest of the year (June). In the far south Wrangel pushed west, fought a battle and occupied Bayazit. In the centre the main forces stood at Kars and Gyumri. Both slowly approached along the Kars-Gyumri road and faced each other, neither side choosing to fight (June\u2013July). On 4 August Russian scouts saw a movement which they thought was the start of a withdrawal, the Russians advanced and the Turks attacked first. [[Battle of Kurekdere|They were defeated]], losing 8,000 men to the Russian 3,000. 10,000 irregulars deserted to their villages. Both sides withdrew to their former positions. About this time the Persians made a semi-secret agreement to remain neutral in exchange for the cancellation of the indemnity from the previous war.\n\n[[File:Kuruk-Dara1.jpg|thumb|General [[Vasili Bebutov|Bebutashvili]] defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Kurekdere]]]]\n\n'''1855: Kars:''' In the year up to May 1855 Turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120,000 to 75,000, mostly by disease. The local [[Armenia]]n population kept Muravyev well-informed about the Turks at Kars and he judged they had about five months of supplies. He therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out. He started in May and by June was south and west of the town. A relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking Erzerum, but Muravyev chose not to. In late September he learned of the fall of Sevastopol and a Turkish landing at Batum. This led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack. [[Siege of Kars|It failed]], the Russians losing 8,000 men and the Turks 1,500 (29 September). The blockade continued and Kars surrendered on 8 November.\n\n'''1855: Georgian coast:''' [[Omar Pasha]], the Turkish commander at Crimea had long wanted to land in Georgia, but the western powers vetoed it. When they relented in August most of the campaigning season was lost. In September 8,000 Turks landed at Batum, but the main concentration was at [[Sukhumi|Sukhum Kale]]. This required a 100-mile march south through a country with poor roads. The Russians planned to hold the line of the [[Inguri River|Ingur River]] which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper. Omar crossed the Ingur on 7 November and then wasted a great deal of time, the Russians doing little. By 2 December he had reached the Tskhenis-dzqali, the rainy season had started, his camps were submerged in mud and there was no bread. Learning of the fall of Kars he withdrew to the Ingur. The Russians did nothing and he evacuated to Batum in February of the following year.\n\n===Baltic theatre===\n{{See also|Charles John Napier#Baltic Campaign}}\nThe [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Edgar | year = 1969 | title = The Scandinavian Area and the Crimean War in the Baltic | journal = Scandinavian Studies | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 263\u201375 | jstor= 40917005}}</ref> Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to [[Saint Petersburg]], the Russian capital.

In the August 1855, the Western Allied Baltic Fleet [[Battle of Suomenlinna|tried to destroy heavily defended Russian dockyards at Sveaborg]] outside [[Helsinki]]. More than 1,000 enemy guns tested the strength of the fortress for two days. Despite the shelling, the sailors of the 120-gun ship ''[[Russian ship of the line Rossiya|Rossiya]]'', led by Captain Viktor Poplonsky, defended the entrance to the harbour. The Allies fired over 20,000 shells but failed to defeat the Russian batteries.

The attack was to be carried out using armored floating batteries. The use of the latter proved to be highly effective in attacking the sea fortress of Kinburn on the Black sea in 1855. Undoubtedly, this threat contributed on the part of Russia the decision on the conclusion of peace on unfavourable terms.\n\n===White Sea theatre===\n[[File:The British Attack of Solovetsky Monastery.jpg|thumb|\"Bombardment of the [[Solovetsky Monastery]] in the [[White Sea]] by the [[Royal Navy]]\", a ''[[lubok]]'' (popular print) from 1868]]\n\nIn late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by [[HMS Miranda (1851)|HMS&nbsp;''Miranda'']] left the Baltic for the [[White Sea]], where they shelled [[Kola (town)|Kola]] (which was destroyed) and the [[Solovetsky Islands|Solovki]].

While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful [[German Empire]] in January 1871, the French deposed Emperor Napoleon III and proclaimed the [[Third French Republic]] (September 1870). During his reign, Napoleon, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France, and France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of the republic. Encouraged by the new attitude of French diplomacy and supported by the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], Russia in October 1870 renounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As the United Kingdom with Austria<ref>Hugh Ragsdale, '' Imperial Russian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge University Press. 1993). p.227</ref> could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a [[Black Sea Fleet|fleet in the Black Sea]].\n[[File:Edouard Dubufe Congr\u00e8s de Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty of Paris (1856)]]]]\n[[File:CrimeaWarMemorialLondon.jpg|thumb|[[Crimean War Memorial]] at Waterloo Place, [[St James's]], London]]\n[[File:Welsford-Parker Monument at the entrance to the Old Burying Ground in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastopol Monument]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 the only Crimean War Monument in North America]]\n\nHistorian Norman Rich argues that the war was not an accident, but was sought out by the determination of the British and French not to allow Russia an honourable retreat. Both insisted on a military victory to enhance their prestige in European affairs when a nonviolent peaceful political solution was available. The war then wrecked the Concert of Europe, which had long kept the peace.<ref>Norman Rich, ''Why the Crimean War?: A Cautionary Tale'' (1985).</ref>\n\nTurkish historian Candan Badem wrote, \"Victory in this war did not bring any significant material gain, not even a war indemnity. On the other hand, the Ottoman treasury was nearly bankrupted due to war expenses\".<ref>Candan Badem, The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856). Leiden-Boston.1970.p.403</ref> Badem adds that the Ottomans achieved no significant territorial gains, lost the right to a navy in the Black Sea and lost its status as a great power. Further, the war gave impetus to the union of the Danubian principalities and ultimately to their independence.\n\nThe treaty punished the defeated Russia, but in the long run, Austria lost the most from the war despite having barely taken part in it.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, [[Kingdom of Austria|Austria]] remained diplomatically isolated following the war,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} which contributed to its disastrous defeats in the 1859 [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] that resulted in the cession of [[Lombardy]] to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and later in the loss of the Habsburg rule of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], which meant the end of Austrian influence in peninsular Italy. Furthermore, Russia did not do anything to assist its former ally, Austria, in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]],<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} when Austria lost [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Venetia]] and, more importantly, its influence in most German-speaking lands. The status of Austria as a great power, with the unifications of [[German unification|Germany]] and [[Italian unification|Italy]], now became very precarious. It had to [[Ausgleich|compromise]] with [[Hungarians|Hungary]]; the two countries shared the Danubian Empire and Austria slowly became little more than a German [[satellite state|satellite]].{{citation needed|date= August 2017}} With France now hostile to Germany and gravitating towards Russia, and with Russia competing with the newly renamed [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] for an increased role in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, the foundations were in place for building the diplomatic alliances that would shape the [[First World War]] of 1914.\n\nThe Treaty's guarantees to preserve Ottoman territories were broken 21 years later when Russia, exploiting nationalist unrest in the Balkans and seeking to regain lost prestige, once again declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 24 April 1877. In this later [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] the states of [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]] gained international recognition of their independence and [[Bulgaria]] achieved its autonomy from direct Ottoman rule.\n\nThe Crimean War marked the re-ascendancy of France to the position of pre-eminent power on the Continent,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|411}} the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of a decline for [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

It was the consequence of more than two years of fatal blundering in slow-motion by inept statesmen who had months to reflect upon the actions they took. It arose from Napoleon's search for prestige; Nicholas's quest for control over the Straits; his naive miscalculation of the probable reactions of the European powers; the failure of those powers to make their positions clear; and the pressure of public opinion in Britain and Constantinople at crucial moments.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first= Shepard B. |editor-last= Clough |title= A History of the Western World |year= 1964 |location= |page= 917 }}</ref>}}\nThe view of 'diplomatic drift' as the cause of the war was first popularised by A. W. Kinglake, who portrayed the British as victims of newspaper sensationalism and duplicitous French and Ottoman diplomacy.\n\nMore recently, historians Andrew Lambert and [[Winfried Baumgart]] have argued that Britain was following a geopolitical strategy in aiming to destroy the fledgling Russian Navy, which might challenge the [[Royal Navy]] for control of the seas, and that the war was also a joint European response to a century of Russian expansion not just southwards but also into Western Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1870, Prussia persuaded Russia to remain neutral in the Franco-Prussian war.<ref>Vinogradov V.

The British public was very well informed regarding the day-to-day realities of the war in the Crimea. After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours.

Pacifists and critics were unpopular but:\n{{quote|in the end they won. [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]] and [[John Bright|Bright]] were true to their principles of foreign policy, which laid down the absolute minimum of intervention in European affairs and a deep moral reprobation of war&nbsp;... When the first enthusiasm was passed, when the dead were mourned, the sufferings revealed, and the cost counted, when in 1870 Russia was able calmly to secure the revocation of the Treaty, which disarmed her in the Black Sea, the view became general of the war was stupid and unnecessary, and effected nothing&nbsp;... The Crimean war remained as a classic example&nbsp;... of how governments may plunge into war, how strong ambassadors may mislead weak prime ministers, how the public may be worked up into a facile fury, and how the achievements of the war may crumble to nothing. The Bright-Cobden criticism of the war was remembered and to a large extent accepted [especially by the Liberal Party]. Isolation from European entanglements seemed more than ever desirable.<ref>R.B.

Some credit Russell with prompting the resignation of the sitting British government through his reporting of the lacklustre condition of British forces deployed in Crimea.

The Russians installed telegraph links to Moscow and St Petersburg during the war, and expanded their rail network south of Moscow after the peace treaty.\n\nThe war also employed modern military tactics, such as trenches and blind artillery fire. The use of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] for shot, coupled with the [[rifling]] of barrels, greatly increased the range and the damage caused by the allied weapons.\n\nThe [[British Army]] system of [[sale of commissions]] came under great scrutiny during the war, especially in connection with the [[Battle of Balaclava]], which saw the ill-fated [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. This scrutiny later led to the abolition of the sale of commissions.\n\nDuring the Crimean war, the first use of steam armored ships in the military history took place. Three [[D\u00e9vastation-class ironclad floating battery|D\u00e9vastation-class floating batteries]] were successfully used against the sea fortress of Kinburn in the autumn of 1855. The direct initiator of this military innovation was the French Emperor Napoleon III. The military threat of the use of this new weapon in the campaign of 1856 contributed to Russia's acceptance of the unfavourable conditions of the Paris treaty of 1856.\n\nScientist Faraday received a proposal from the British government to develop chemical weapons for use in the siege of Sevastopol. Faraday categorically refused and publicly condemned the proposal and his position contributed to the rejection of the development and use of these weapons during the Crimean war.\n\nThe Crimean War was a contributing factor in the Russian [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] in 1861: Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (Nicholas I's son and successor) saw the military defeat of the Russian serf-army by free troops from Britain and France as proof of the need for emancipation.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Moon\n  | first = David\n  | title = The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia, 1762\u20131907\n  | publisher = Pearson Education\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = Harlow, England\n  | pages = 49\u201355\n  | isbn = 978-0-582-29486-8}}</ref> The Crimean War also led to the realisation by the Russian government of its technological inferiority, in military practices as well as weapons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russianwarrior.com/STMMain.htm |title=STMMain |publisher=Russianwarrior.com |date= |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Russian military medicine saw dramatic progress: [[Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov|N.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Pirogov]], known as the father of Russian field surgery, developed the use of [[anaesthetics]], plaster casts, enhanced [[amputation]] methods, and five-stage [[triage]] in Crimea, among other things.\n\nThe war also led to the establishment of the [[Victoria Cross]] in 1856 (backdated to 1854), the British Army's first universal award for valour. 111 medals were awarded.\n\nThe British issued the [[Crimea Medal]] with 5 clasps, and the [[Baltic Medal]], as well as Valour medals, including the newly created [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], the Turkish the [[Turkish Crimea Medal]], the French did not issue a campaign medal, issuing [[M\u00e9daille militaire]] and [[Legion of Honour]] for bravery, Sardinia also issued a [[Sardinian Crimea Medal|medal]].

The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the [[Holy Land]], which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of [[Roman Catholic]]s, while Russia promoted those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The longer-term causes involved the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire's expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key,<ref>[https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/crimean-war The Crimean War. Richard Cavendish. Published in History Today, Volume 54, Issue 3, March 2004, Retrieved 12 August 2019]</ref> have never revealed a \"greater confusion of purpose\", yet they led to a war noted for its \"notoriously incompetent international butchery\".{{sfn|Troubetzkoy|2006|p=208}}\n\nWhile the churches worked out their differences and [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|came to an agreement]], [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to. When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement, Nicholas recanted and prepared for war. Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain, the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853.\n\nThe war started in the [[Balkans]] in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the [[Danubian Principalities]]<ref name=\"EB\">{{Britannica|143040}}</ref> (now part of [[Romania]]), which were under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], then began to cross the [[Danube]]. Led by [[Omar Pasha]], the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at [[Silistra]]. A separate action on the fort town of [[Kars]] in eastern Anatolia led to a siege, and a Turkish attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a Russian fleet at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]]. Fearing an Ottoman collapse, France and Britain rushed forces to [[Gallipoli]]. They then moved north to [[Varna]] in June 1854, arriving just in time for the Russians to abandon Silistra. Aside from a minor skirmish at [[Constan\u021ba|K\u00f6stence]] (today Constan\u021ba), there was little for the allies to do. [[Karl Marx]] quipped, \"there they are, the French doing nothing and the British helping them as fast as possible\".{{sfn|Troubetzkoy|2006|p=192}}\n\nFrustrated by the wasted effort, and with demands for action from their citizens, the allied force decided to attack Russia's main naval base in the [[Black Sea]] at [[Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]]. After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and marched their way to a point south of Sevastopol after the successful [[Battle of the Alma]]. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the [[Battle of Balaclava]] and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, at [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], ended in stalemate. The front settled into a siege and led to brutal conditions for troops on both sides. Smaller military actions took place in the [[Baltic coast|Baltic]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[White Sea]], and the [[North Pacific]].\n\nSevastopol fell after eleven months, and neutral countries began to join the Allied cause. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, Russia [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]] in March 1856. France and Britain welcomed this development, as the conflict was growing unpopular at home. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war. It forbade Russia from basing warships in the [[Black Sea]]. The Ottoman [[vassal state]]s of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] became largely independent. Christians there were granted a degree of official equality, and the Orthodox Church regained control of the Christian churches in dispute.<ref name=\"Figes2010\">{{cite book |last= Figes |first= Orlando |title= Crimea: The Last Crusade |year= 2010 |location= London |publisher= Allen Lane |isbn= 978-0-7139-9704-0 }}</ref>{{rp|415}}\n\nThe Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], railways, and [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]].<ref name=\"Royle2000\">{{cite book |last= Royle |first= Trevor |title= Crimea: The Great Crimean War, 1854\u20131856 |year= 2000 |location= |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-1-4039-6416-8 }}</ref>{{rp|at= Preface}} The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and [[war photography|photographs]]. As the legend of the \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]\" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and [[management|mismanagement]]. The reaction in Britain was a demand for professionalisation, most famously achieved by [[Florence Nightingale]], who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while treating the wounded.\n\nThe Crimean War proved to be the moment of truth for Russia.  The war weakened the army, drained the treasury and undermined Russia's influence in Europe. It would take decades to recover. The humiliation forced Russia's educated elites to identify the Empire's problems and to recognize the need for fundamental reforms. They saw rapid modernization of the country as the sole way of it recovering the status of a European power. The war thus was a catalyst for the reforms of Russia's social institutions, including [[serfdom]], justice, local self-government, education, and military service. More recently, scholars have also turned their attention to the impact of the Crimean War on the development of Russian nationalistic discourse.\n\n==The \"Eastern Question\"==\n{{see also|Eastern Question}} \nAs the Ottoman Empire [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|steadily weakened]] during the 19th century, Russia stood poised to take advantage by expanding south. In the 1850s, the [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom|British]] and the French, who were allied with the Ottoman Empire, were determined not to allow this to happen.<ref>Matthew Smith Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774\u20131923: A Study in International Relations'' (1966).</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2019}}\n[[A.

The [[Serbian Revolution]] in 1804 resulted in the self-liberation of the first [[Balkan]] Christian nation under the Ottoman Empire. The [[Greek War of Independence]], which began in early 1821, provided further evidence of the internal and military weakness of the Ottoman Empire, and the commission of atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see [[Chios massacre]]) further undermined the Ottomans. The disbandment of the centuries-old [[Janissaries|Janissary]] corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 ([[Auspicious Incident]]) helped the Ottoman Empire in the longer term, but in the short term it deprived the country of its existing standing army.{{clarify|date=February 2017}} In 1828, the allied Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all the Ottoman naval forces during the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1830, Greece became an independent state after 10 years of war and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)]]. According to the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|1829 Treaty of Adrianople]], Russian and Western European commercial ships were authorized to freely pass through the [[Dardanelles|Black Sea straits]], Serbia received autonomy, and the Danubian Principalities ([[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]) became territories under Russian protection.\n\n[[File:Navarino-A L Garneray.jpg|thumb|left|Naval [[Battle of Navarino]], 1827]]\n\nFrance took the opportunity to [[French conquest of Algeria|occupy Algeria]] in 1830. In 1831 [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who was the most powerful [[vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire, claimed independence. Ottoman forces were [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|defeated in a number of battles]], and the Egyptians were ready to capture [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], which forced Sultan [[Mahmud II]] to seek Russian military aid. A Russian army of 10,000 landed on the [[Bosphorus]] shores in 1833 and helped to prevent the capture of Constantinople. As a result, the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi|Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]] was signed, benefiting Russia greatly. It provided for a military alliance between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, if one of them were to be attacked, and a secret additional clause allowed the Ottomans to opt out of sending troops but to close the Straits to foreign warships if Russia was under threat. Egypt remained under nominal Ottoman sovereignty, although it was de facto independent:\n\nIn 1838 the situation was similar to 1831. Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about his lack of control and power in [[Syria]], and he [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|resumed military action]]. The [[Ottoman Army]] lost to the Egyptians at the [[Battle of Nezib]] on 24 June 1839. The Ottoman Empire was saved by Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, who signed a convention in London on 15 July 1840 granting Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian armed forces from Syria and [[Lebanon]]. Moreover, Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence to the Ottoman sultan. After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention, the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blockaded the [[Nile Delta]], bombarded [[Beirut]] and captured [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840.\n\nOn 13 July 1841, after the expiry of the [[Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]], the [[London Straits Convention]] was signed under pressure from European countries. The new treaty deprived Russia of its right to block warships from passing into the Black Sea in case of war. Thus the way to the Black Sea was open for British and French warships in case of a possible Russo-Ottoman conflict.\n\nIt must be said that this fact confirms the statements of Russian historians about the absence of aggressive plans of Russia. Russian historian writes: \"The signing of the documents was the result of deliberate decisions: instead of bilateral (none of the great powers recognized this Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi), the new Treaty of London was obligatory for all, it closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\" <ref>Vinogradov V.N.

Britain and France desired more than any other states to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire because they did not want to see Russia gaining access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Austria had fears for the same reasons. The travel writer [[Charles Boileau Elliott]] wrote about the conflicts and relationships between the Ottoman government, Russia, and the [[Tatars]] in his diary, ''Travels In The Three Great Empires of Austria, Russia, and Turkey'' (1838).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Even back during this time there was significant dispute about which governments should control the destiny of the Crimean Peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Russian expansionism===\n[[Image:Siege of Varna 1828.jpg|thumb|Russian [[siege of Varna]] in [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman-ruled Bulgaria]], July\u2013September 1828]]\nRussia, as a member of the [[Holy Alliance]], had operated as the \"police of Europe\", maintaining the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] that had been established in the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]] in 1815.

There he convinced the Sultan to reject the Russian treaty proposal, as compromising the independence of the Turks. The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons, [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], blamed Aberdeen and Stratford's actions for making war inevitable, thus starting the process which forced the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855, over the war.\n\nShortly after he learned of the failure of Menshikov's diplomacy toward the end of June 1853, the Tsar sent armies under the commands of Field Marshal [[Ivan Paskevich]] and General [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov|Mikhail Gorchakov]] across the River Pruth into the Ottoman-controlled [[Danubian Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. Fewer than half of the 80,000 Russian soldiers who crossed the Pruth in 1853 survived.

Now Russia used the Sultan's failure to resolve the issue of the protection of the Christian sites in the Holy Land as a pretext for Russian occupation of these Danubian provinces. Nicholas believed that the [[Europeans|European]] powers, especially [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces, especially considering that Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848 Hungarian Revolution]] in 1849.\n\nIn July 1853, the Tsar sent his troops into the [[Danubian Principalities]].

The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France, Austria and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]) met in [[Vienna]], where they drafted a note that they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans. The peace terms arrived at by the four powers at the Vienna Conference (1853) were delivered to the Russians by the Austrian Foreign Minister [[Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol|Count Karl von Buol]] on 5 December 1853. The note met with the approval of Nicholas I, but [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]] rejected the proposal, feeling that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many different interpretations.

Along with the additional 5 battle ships, in the [[Battle of Sinop]] on 30 November 1853, they destroyed a patrol squadron of 11 Ottoman battle ships while they were anchored in port under defense of the onshore artillery garrison. The United Kingdom and French press shaped the public opinion to demand the war. Both used Sinop as the ''[[casus belli]]'' (\"act of war\") for declaring war against Russia.

Austria, however, felt threatened by the Russian troops in the Balkans. On 27 February 1854, the United Kingdom and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the principalities. Austria supported them, and, though it did not declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality.

Determined to address the Eastern Question by putting an end to the Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire, the allies in August 1854 proposed the \"Four Points\" for ending the conflict, in addition to the Russian withdrawal:\n* Russia was to give up its protectorate over the Danubian Principalities;\n* The Danube was to be opened up to foreign commerce;\n* The [[London Straits Convention|Straits Convention of 1841]], which allowed only Ottoman and Russian warships in the Black Sea, was to be revised;\n* Russia was to abandon any claim granting it the right to interfere in Ottoman affairs on behalf of Orthodox Christians.\n\nThese points (particularly the third) would require clarification through negotiation, but Russia refused to negotiate. The allies including Austria therefore agreed that Britain and France should take further military action to prevent further Russian aggression against the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]], who moved forces into [[Transylvania]] in response. However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Turks. Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians.

When the Russian troops crossed the River Pruth into Moldavia, the Orthodox Christians showed no interest in rising up against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|131, 137}} Adding to the worries of Nicholas I was the concern that Austria would enter the war against the Russians and attack his armies on the western flank. Indeed, after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between Russia and Ottoman Empire, the Austrians entered the war on the side of the Ottomans with an attack against the Russians in the Principalities which threatened to cut off the Russian supply lines. Accordingly, the Russians were forced to raise the siege of Silistra on 23 June 1854, and begin abandoning the Principalities.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|185}} The lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a Russian advance into Bulgaria.\n\nIn June 1854, the Allied expeditionary force landed at [[Varna]], a city on the Black Sea's western coast. They made little advance from their base there.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|175\u201376}} In July 1854, the Ottomans under Omar Pasha crossed the Danube into Wallachia and on 7 July 1854 engaged the Russians in the city of [[Giurgiu]] and conquered it. The capture of Giurgiu by the Ottomans immediately threatened Bucharest in Wallachia with capture by the same Ottoman army. On 26 July 1854, Tsar Nicholas I, responding to an Austrian ultimatum, ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Principalities. Also, in late July 1854, following up on the Russian retreat, the French staged an expedition against the Russian forces still in Dobruja, but this was a failure.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|188\u201390}}\n\nBy then, the Russian withdrawal was complete, except for the fortress towns of northern Dobruja, while their place in the Principalities was taken by the Austrians, as a neutral peacekeeping force.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|189}} There was little further action on this front after late 1854, and in September the allied force boarded ships at Varna to invade the [[Crimean Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|198}}\n\n===Black Sea theatre===\n[[File:Turkish troops storming Fort Shefketil (cropped).jpg|thumb|Turkish troops storming [[Shekvetili|Fort Shefketil]]]]\n\nThe naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch, in mid-1853, of the French and British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment. By June 1853, both fleets were stationed at [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besikas Bay]], outside the [[Dardanelles]]. With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in October, they moved to the [[Bosphorus]] and in November entered the Black Sea.\n\nDuring this period, the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] was operating against Ottoman coastal traffic between Constantinople and the Caucasus ports, while the Ottoman fleet sought to protect this supply line. The clash came on 30 November 1853 when a Russian fleet attacked an Ottoman force in the harbour at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], and destroyed it at the [[Battle of Sinop]]. The battle outraged opinion in UK, which called for war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Guy|title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&pg=PR95|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=95|isbn=9780810866133}}</ref> There was little additional naval action until March 1854 when on the declaration of war the British frigate HMS ''Furious'' was fired on outside [[Odessa]] Harbour. In response an Anglo-French fleet [[Bombardment of Odessa|bombarded the port]], causing much damage to the town. To show support for Turkey after the battle of Sinop, on 22 December 1853, the Anglo-French squadron entered the Black Sea and the steamship HMS ''Retribution'' approached the [[Port of Sevastopol]], the commander of which received an ultimatum not to allow any ships in the Black Sea.\n\nIn June, the fleets transported the Allied expeditionary forces to [[Varna]], in support of the Ottoman operations on the Danube; in September they again transported the armies, this time to the Crimea. The Russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies, preferring to maintain a \"[[fleet in being]]\"; this strategy failed when Sevastopol, the main port and where most of the Black Sea fleet was based, came under siege. The Russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as [[blockship]]s, after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore. During the siege, the Russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], twelve 84-gun two-deckers and four 60-gun [[frigate]]s in the Black Sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels. During the rest of the campaign the allied fleets remained in control of the Black Sea, ensuring the various fronts were kept supplied.\n\nIn May 1855, the allies successfully invaded  [[Kerch]] and operated against [[Siege of Taganrog|Taganrog]] in the [[Sea of Azov]]. In September they moved against Russian installations in the [[Dnieper]] estuary, [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|attacking Kinburn]] in the first use of [[ironclad]] ships in naval warfare.\n\n===Crimean campaign===\n[[File:Russo-British skirmish during Crimean War.png|thumb|upright|Russo-British skirmish during the Crimean War]]\n\nThe Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854.

There was no sign of the enemy and the invading troops all landed on 14 September 1854. It took another four days to land all the stores, equipment, horses and artillery.\n\n[[File:Battle of Alma Sutherland highlanders.png|thumb|left|[[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|93rd Sutherland Highlanders]] at the Battle of Alma]]\n\nThe landing took place north of Sevastopol, so the Russians had arrayed their army in expectation of a direct attack. The allies advanced and on the morning of 20 September came up to the River Alma and engaged the Russian army. The position was strong, but after three hours,<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|424}} the allied frontal attack had driven the Russians out of their dug-in positions with losses of 6,000 men. The [[Battle of the Alma]] resulted in 3,300 Allied losses. Failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many strategic errors made during the war, and the Russians themselves noted that had the Allies pressed south that day they would have easily captured Sevastopol.\n \nBelieving the northern approaches to the city too well defended, especially due to the presence of a large [[star fort]] and because Sevastopol was on the south side of [[Sevastopol Bay|the inlet from the sea that made the harbour]], Sir [[John Fox Burgoyne|John Burgoyne]], the engineer advisor, recommended that the allies attack Sevastopol from the south. The joint commanders, [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Raglan]] and [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|St Arnaud]], agreed.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|426}} On 25 September the whole army began to march southeast and encircled the city from the south, after establishing port facilities at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] for the British and at [[Kamiesch]] ({{lang-ru | \u041a\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0445\u0442\u0430 | translit = Kamyshovaya bukhta}}) for the French.

The British bombardment worked better than that of the French, who had smaller-calibre guns. The fleet suffered high casualties during the day. The British wanted to attack that afternoon, but the French wanted to defer the attack. A postponement was agreed, but on the next day the French were still not ready. By 19 October the Russians had transferred some heavy guns to the southern defences and outgunned the allies.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|431}}\n\nReinforcements for the Russians gave them the courage to send out probing attacks. The Allied lines, beginning to suffer from cholera as early as September, were stretched. The French, on the west had less to do than the British on the east with their siege lines and the large nine-mile open wing back to their supply base on the south coast.\n\n===Battle of Balaclava===\n{{Main|Battle of Balaclava}}\n[[File:Relief of the Light Brigade.png|thumb|British cavalry charging against Russian forces at Balaclava]]\n\nA large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.{{rp|521\u201327}} The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units. At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the [[93rd&nbsp;Highlanders]], who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]]. Rather than \"[[Infantry square|form square]]\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line, two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie rifles]], with which his troops were armed, at the Battle of Alma a month before, and he was confident his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded.<ref>Greenwood, ch. 8</ref> From up on the ridge to the west, ''[[The Times|Times]]'' correspondent [[William Howard Russell]] saw the Highlanders as a \"thin red streak topped with steel\", a phrase which soon became the \"[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|Thin Red Line]]\".<ref>John Millin Selby, ''The thin red line of Balaclava'' (London: Hamilton, 1970)</ref>\n\n[[File:Chasseurs d'Afrique \u00e0 Balaclava.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]], led by General [[Armand-Octave-Marie d'Allonville|d'Allonville]], clearing Russian artillery from the Fedyukhin Heights during the Battle of Balaclava]]\n\nSoon after, a Russian cavalry movement was countered by the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade|Heavy Brigade]], who charged and fought hand-to-hand until the Russians retreated. This caused a more widespread Russian retreat, including a number of their artillery units. When the local commanders failed to take advantage of the retreat, Lord Raglan sent out orders to move up and prevent the withdrawal of naval guns from the recently captured redoubts on the heights. Raglan could see these guns due to his position on the hill; when in the valley, this view was obstructed, leaving the wrong guns in sight. The local commanders ignored the demands, leading to the British [[aide-de-camp]] (Captain Nolan) personally delivering the quickly written and confusing order to attack the artillery. When Lord Lucan questioned which guns the order referred to, the aide-de-camp pointed to the first Russian battery he could see and allegedly said \"There is your enemy, there are your guns\"\u2014due to his obstructed view, these were the wrong ones. Lucan then passed the order to the Earl of Cardigan, resulting in the [[charge of the Light Brigade]].\n\nIn this charge, Cardigan formed up his unit and charged the length of the Valley of the Balaclava, under fire from Russian batteries in the hills. The charge of the Light Brigade caused 278 casualties of the 700-man unit. The Light Brigade was memorialised in the famous poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\". Although traditionally the charge of the Light Brigade was looked upon as a glorious but wasted sacrifice of good men and horses, recent historians say that the charge of the Light Brigade did succeed in at least some of its objectives.<ref>John Sweetman, ''Balaclava 1854: The charge of the light brigade'' (Osprey Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?&id=fr7FjlzvrfwC excerpt]</ref> The aim of any cavalry charge is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off the battlefield.

On 5 November 1854, the Russians attempted to raise the siege at Sevastopol with an attack against the allies, which resulted in another allied victory.<ref>Patrick Mercer, ''Inkerman 1854: The Soldiers' Battle'' (1998) </ref>\n\n===The winter of 1854\u201355===\n[[File:Weller Siege of Sebastopol 1854-1855.jpg|thumb|Historical map showing the territory between Balaclava and Sevastopol at the time of the Siege of Sevastopol]]\n\nWinter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and [[materiel]] on both sides led to a halt in ground operations. Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, while the allied armies were hemmed in by the Russian Army in the interior. On 14 November the \"[[Great Storm of 1854|Balaklava Storm]]\" sank thirty allied transport ships,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_crimean.html|title=Crimean War, 1853\u20131856|work=historyofwar.org|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> including {{HMS|Prince|1854|6}}, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|435}} The storm and heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to disintegrate into a quagmire, requiring engineers to devote most of their time to its repair including quarrying stone.

Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.\n\nIn April 1855, the allies staged a second all-out bombardment, leading to an artillery duel with the Russian guns, but no ground assault followed.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|340\u201341}}\n\nOn 24 May 1855, sixty ships containing 7,000 French, 5,000 Turkish and 3,000 British troops set off for a raid on the city of [[Kerch]] east of Sevastopol in an attempt to open another front on the Crimean peninsula and to cut off Russian supplies.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|344}} When the allies landed the force at [[Kerch]], the plan was to outflank the [[Russian Army]]. The landings were successful, but the force made little progress thereafter.\n\n[[File:Battle of the Chernaya.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Battle of the Chernaya]], the forces at the beginning of the battle and the Russian advance]]\n\nMany more artillery pieces had arrived and had been dug into batteries. \nThe first General assault of Sevastopol took place on June 18, 1855. There is a legend that the assault was scheduled for this date in favour of Napoleon III in the 40th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. This legend is not confirmed by historians.<ref>Tarle E.V. Crimean war. \u041c.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2, p.367</ref> But undoubtedly the appearance of such a legend is symptomatic, if we remember that the war in France was understood as a certain revanche for the defeat of 1812.\n\nIn June, a third bombardment was followed after two days by a successful attack on the Mamelon, but a follow-up assault on the Malakoff failed with heavy losses. During this time the garrison commander, [[Pavel Nakhimov|Admiral Nakhimov]] fell on 30 June 1855,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|378}} and Raglan died on 28 June.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|460}} Losses in these battles were so great that by agreement of military opponents short-term truces for removal of corpses were signed (these truces were described in the work Of Leo Tolstoy \"Sevastopol sketches\"). The assault was beaten back with heavy casualties and it was an undoubted victory of Russia. It is worth mentioning that the Russian [[Siege of Sevastopol (panorama)]] depicts the moment of the assault of Sevastopol on June 18, 1855.\n\nIn August, the Russians again made an attack towards the base at Balaclava, defended by the French, newly arrived Sardinian, and Ottoman troops.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|461}} The resulting [[Battle of the Chernaya]] was a defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy casualties.\n\n[[File:Vernet - La prise de Malakoff.jpg|thumb|upright|The French captured Sevastopol after a nearly year-long siege.]]\n\nFor months each side had been building forward rifle pits and defensive positions, which resulted in many skirmishes. Artillery fire aimed to gain superiority over the enemy guns.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|450\u201362}} The final assault was made on 5 September, when another French bombardment (the sixth) was followed by an assault by the French Army on 8 September, resulting in the French capture of the Malakoff fort. The Russians failed to retake it and their defences collapsed. Meanwhile, the British assaulted the [[Battle of the Great Redan|Great Redan]], a Russian defensive battlement just south of the city of Sevastopol\u2014a position that had been attacked repeatedly for months. Whether the British captured the Redan remains in dispute: Russian historians recognize only the loss of the Malakhov Kurgan (a key point of defence), claiming that all other positions were retained.<ref>Tarle E.V. Crimean war. \u041c.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2 p.462</ref> What is agreed is that the Russians abandoned the positions, blowing up their powder magazines and retreating to the north.

The main objective of the siege, the destruction of the Russian fleet and docks, took place over the winter. On 28 February, multiple mines blew up the five docks, the canal, and three locks.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|471}}\n\n===Azov campaign===\n{{Main|Siege of Taganrog}}\n[[File:Simpson Disembarkation of the expedition to Kertch at Kamish Bournou.jpg|thumb|left|Disembarkation of the expedition to [[Kerch]]]]\n\nIn early 1855 the allied Anglo-French commanders decided to send an Anglo-French naval squadron into the [[Azov Sea]] to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged [[Sevastopol]]. On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the [[Kerch Strait]] and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay. Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov. Except for [[Rostov]] and [[Azov]], no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight. This Allied campaign led to a significant reduction in supplies flowing to the besieged Russian troops at Sevastopol.\n\nOn 21 May 1855, the [[gunboat]]s and armed steamers attacked the seaport of [[Taganrog]], the most important hub near [[Rostov on Don]]. The vast amounts of food, especially bread, wheat, barley and rye that were amassed in the city after the outbreak of war were prevented from being exported.\n\nThe [[Governor of Taganrog]], [[Yegor Tolstoy]], and lieutenant-general [[Ivan Krasnov]] refused an allied ultimatum, responding that \"Russians never surrender their cities\". The Anglo\u2013French squadron bombarded [[Taganrog]] for 6{{frac|2}}&nbsp;hours and landed 300 troops near the [[Depaldo stone stairs|Old Stairway]] in the centre of Taganrog, but they were thrown back by [[Don Cossacks]] and a volunteer corps.\n\nIn July 1855, the allied squadron tried to go past Taganrog to [[Rostov-on-Don]], entering the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]] through the [[Mius River]]. On 12 July 1855 HMS&nbsp;''Jasper'' grounded near Taganrog thanks to a fisherman who moved [[buoy]]s into shallow water. The [[Cossacks]] captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up. The third siege attempt was made 19\u201331 August 1855, but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations. The allied fleet left the [[Gulf of Taganrog]] on 2 September 1855, with [[HMS Grinder (1855)|minor military operations]] along the [[Azov Sea]] coast continuing until late 1855.\n\n===Caucasus theatre===\n[[File:The Armenian Front During the Crimean War, 1853-56.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Caucasus front during the Crimean War]]\n{{Location map+|Georgia (country)|width=250px|float=right|relief=1|thumb|caption='''Georgian coast:''' <br/>'''Ab'''= Abkhazia; Red=Turkish, Blue=Russian\n|places=\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=43.00|long=41.02|label=Sukhum Kale|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.40|long=41.58|label=Anaklia|position=left|mark=Blue-circle.gif}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.55|long=41.78|label=|mark=Pfeil links unten.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.65|long=41.98|label=Ingur River|mark=Pfeil links unten.svg}}\n\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.27|long=41.64|label=RedutKale|position=left|mark=Blue-circle.gif}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.13|long=41.66|label=Poti|mark=Blue-circle.gif|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.16|long=42.41|label=Marani|mark=Blue-circle.gif|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.36|long=42.55|label=TskhenisDzqali|mark=Pfeil links unten.svg}}\n\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.82|long=41.77|label=FortStNicholas|position=left|mark=Blue-circle.gif}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.82|long=41.95|label=|mark=Pfeil links.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.82|long=42.10|label=Cholok River|position=right|mark=AB-Fluss.svg}}\n\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.63|long=41.63|label=Batum|position=left|mark=Point carte.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.64|long=42.98|label=Akaltsike|position=bottom|mark=Blue-circle.gif}}\n\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=41.72|long=44.78|mark=Blue-circle.gif|position=top|label=Tiflis}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=43.02|long=44.65|label=Vladikazkaz|mark=Blue-circle.gif|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=43.25|long=42.25|label=Circassians|mark=clear pog.svg|position=top|label_size=130}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=42.60|long=41.58|label=Ab|mark=clear pog.svg|position=top|label_size=110}}\n{{Location map~|Georgia (country)|lat=43.44|long=41.02|label=Ab|mark=clear pog.svg|position=bottom|label_size=110}}\n}}\nAs in the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|previous wars]] the Caucasus front was secondary to what was happening in the west. Perhaps because of better communications western events sometimes influenced the east. The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] coast. Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky and few fought aggressively.<ref>This section summarizes [[William Edward David Allen]] and Paul Muratoff, ''Caucasian Battlefields'', 1953, Book II</ref>\n\n'''1853:''' There were four main events. 1. In the north the Turks captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack (27/28 October). They then pushed about 20,000 troops across the [[Choloki River|River Cholok]] border. Being outnumbered, the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to Marani. Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months. 2. In the centre the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements (13 November). The Russians routed them. The claimed losses were 4,000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about 30,000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at [[Gyumri]] or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town. Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped. The Turks failed to press their advantage; the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1,000 men out of 5,000. The Russians now decided to advance. The Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked. They were defeated in the [[Battle of Ba\u015fgedikler]], losing 6,000 men, half their artillery and all their supply train. The Russians lost 1,300, including Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnapped by [[Imam Shamil]] at [[Tsinandali]]. 4. At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinope]].\n\n'''1854:''' The British and French declared war on 3 January. Early in the year the Anglo-French fleet appeared in the Black Sea and the Russians abandoned the Black Sea Defensive Line from Anapa south. N. A. Read, who replaced Vorontsov, fearing an Anglo-French landing in conjunction with [[Shamil, 3rd Imam of Dagestan]] and the [[Persia]]ns, recommended withdrawal north of the Caucasus. For this he was replaced by Baryatinsky. When the allies chose a land attack on Sebastopol any plan for a landing in the east was abandoned.\n\nIn the north Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, retired behind the Cholok River and suspended action for the rest of the year (June). In the far south Wrangel pushed west, fought a battle and occupied Bayazit. In the centre the main forces stood at Kars and Gyumri. Both slowly approached along the Kars-Gyumri road and faced each other, neither side choosing to fight (June\u2013July). On 4 August Russian scouts saw a movement which they thought was the start of a withdrawal, the Russians advanced and the Turks attacked first. [[Battle of Kurekdere|They were defeated]], losing 8,000 men to the Russian 3,000. 10,000 irregulars deserted to their villages. Both sides withdrew to their former positions. About this time the Persians made a semi-secret agreement to remain neutral in exchange for the cancellation of the indemnity from the previous war.\n\n[[File:Kuruk-Dara1.jpg|thumb|General [[Vasili Bebutov|Bebutashvili]] defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Kurekdere]]]]\n\n'''1855: Kars:''' In the year up to May 1855 Turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120,000 to 75,000, mostly by disease. The local [[Armenia]]n population kept Muravyev well-informed about the Turks at Kars and he judged they had about five months of supplies. He therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out. He started in May and by June was south and west of the town. A relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking Erzerum, but Muravyev chose not to. In late September he learned of the fall of Sevastopol and a Turkish landing at Batum. This led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack. [[Siege of Kars|It failed]], the Russians losing 8,000 men and the Turks 1,500 (29 September). The blockade continued and Kars surrendered on 8 November.\n\n'''1855: Georgian coast:''' [[Omar Pasha]], the Turkish commander at Crimea had long wanted to land in Georgia, but the western powers vetoed it. When they relented in August most of the campaigning season was lost. In September 8,000 Turks landed at Batum, but the main concentration was at [[Sukhumi|Sukhum Kale]]. This required a 100-mile march south through a country with poor roads. The Russians planned to hold the line of the [[Inguri River|Ingur River]] which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper. Omar crossed the Ingur on 7 November and then wasted a great deal of time, the Russians doing little. By 2 December he had reached the Tskhenis-dzqali, the rainy season had started, his camps were submerged in mud and there was no bread. Learning of the fall of Kars he withdrew to the Ingur. The Russians did nothing and he evacuated to Batum in February of the following year.\n\n===Baltic theatre===\n{{See also|Charles John Napier#Baltic Campaign}}\nThe [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Edgar | year = 1969 | title = The Scandinavian Area and the Crimean War in the Baltic | journal = Scandinavian Studies | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 263\u201375 | jstor= 40917005}}</ref> Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to [[Saint Petersburg]], the Russian capital.

The attack was to be carried out using armored floating batteries. The use of the latter proved to be highly effective in attacking the sea fortress of Kinburn on the Black sea in 1855. Undoubtedly, this threat contributed on the part of Russia the decision on the conclusion of peace on unfavourable terms.\n\n===White Sea theatre===\n[[File:The British Attack of Solovetsky Monastery.jpg|thumb|\"Bombardment of the [[Solovetsky Monastery]] in the [[White Sea]] by the [[Royal Navy]]\", a ''[[lubok]]'' (popular print) from 1868]]\n\nIn late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by [[HMS Miranda (1851)|HMS&nbsp;''Miranda'']] left the Baltic for the [[White Sea]], where they shelled [[Kola (town)|Kola]] (which was destroyed) and the [[Solovetsky Islands|Solovki]].

The destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol and other naval docks was a humiliation. No compulsory disarmament had ever been imposed on a great power previously.... The Allies did not really think that they were dealing with a European power in Russia. They regarded Russia as a semi-Asiatic state....In Russia itself, the Crimean defeat discredited the armed services and highlighted the need to modernize the countries defences, not just in the strictly military sense, but also through the building of railways, industrialization, sound finances and so on....The image many Russians had built up of their country \u2013 the biggest, richest and most powerful in the world \u2013 had suddenly been shattered. Russia's backwardness had been exposed....The Crimean disaster had exposed the shortcomings of every institution in Russia \u2013 not just the corruption and incompetence of the military command, the technological backwardness of the army and navy, or the inadequate roads and lack of railways the accounted for the chronic problems of supply, but the poor condition and illiteracy of the serfs who made up the armed forces, the inability of the serf economy to sustain a state of war against industrial powers, and the failures of autocracy itself. <ref>Figes,  ''The Crimean War, '' pp 442-443 </ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] stood until 1871, when Prussia defeated France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371. While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful [[German Empire]] in January 1871, the French deposed Emperor Napoleon III and proclaimed the [[Third French Republic]] (September 1870). During his reign, Napoleon, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France, and France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of the republic. Encouraged by the new attitude of French diplomacy and supported by the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], Russia in October 1870 renounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As the United Kingdom with Austria<ref>Hugh Ragsdale, '' Imperial Russian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge University Press. 1993). p.227</ref> could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a [[Black Sea Fleet|fleet in the Black Sea]].\n[[File:Edouard Dubufe Congr\u00e8s de Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty of Paris (1856)]]]]\n[[File:CrimeaWarMemorialLondon.jpg|thumb|[[Crimean War Memorial]] at Waterloo Place, [[St James's]], London]]\n[[File:Welsford-Parker Monument at the entrance to the Old Burying Ground in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastopol Monument]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 the only Crimean War Monument in North America]]\n\nHistorian Norman Rich argues that the war was not an accident, but was sought out by the determination of the British and French not to allow Russia an honourable retreat. Both insisted on a military victory to enhance their prestige in European affairs when a nonviolent peaceful political solution was available. The war then wrecked the Concert of Europe, which had long kept the peace.<ref>Norman Rich, ''Why the Crimean War?: A Cautionary Tale'' (1985).</ref>\n\nTurkish historian Candan Badem wrote, \"Victory in this war did not bring any significant material gain, not even a war indemnity. On the other hand, the Ottoman treasury was nearly bankrupted due to war expenses\".<ref>Candan Badem, The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856). Leiden-Boston.1970.p.403</ref> Badem adds that the Ottomans achieved no significant territorial gains, lost the right to a navy in the Black Sea and lost its status as a great power. Further, the war gave impetus to the union of the Danubian principalities and ultimately to their independence.\n\nThe treaty punished the defeated Russia, but in the long run, Austria lost the most from the war despite having barely taken part in it.<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, [[Kingdom of Austria|Austria]] remained diplomatically isolated following the war,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} which contributed to its disastrous defeats in the 1859 [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] that resulted in the cession of [[Lombardy]] to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and later in the loss of the Habsburg rule of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], which meant the end of Austrian influence in peninsular Italy. Furthermore, Russia did not do anything to assist its former ally, Austria, in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]],<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|433}} when Austria lost [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Venetia]] and, more importantly, its influence in most German-speaking lands. The status of Austria as a great power, with the unifications of [[German unification|Germany]] and [[Italian unification|Italy]], now became very precarious. It had to [[Ausgleich|compromise]] with [[Hungarians|Hungary]]; the two countries shared the Danubian Empire and Austria slowly became little more than a German [[satellite state|satellite]].{{citation needed|date= August 2017}} With France now hostile to Germany and gravitating towards Russia, and with Russia competing with the newly renamed [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] for an increased role in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, the foundations were in place for building the diplomatic alliances that would shape the [[First World War]] of 1914.\n\nThe Treaty's guarantees to preserve Ottoman territories were broken 21 years later when Russia, exploiting nationalist unrest in the Balkans and seeking to regain lost prestige, once again declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 24 April 1877. In this later [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] the states of [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]] gained international recognition of their independence and [[Bulgaria]] achieved its autonomy from direct Ottoman rule.\n\nThe Crimean War marked the re-ascendancy of France to the position of pre-eminent power on the Continent,<ref name=\"Figes2010\" />{{rp|411}} the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of a decline for [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

Some credit Russell with prompting the resignation of the sitting British government through his reporting of the lacklustre condition of British forces deployed in Crimea. Additionally, the telegraph reduced the independence of British overseas possessions from their commanders in London due to such rapid communications. Newspaper readership informed public opinion in the United Kingdom and France as never before.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ian V. |last=Hogg |title=The British Army in the 20th Century |location=London |publisher=Ian Allan |year=1985 |page=11 |isbn=978-0-7110-1505-0 }}</ref> It was the first European war to be photographed. The Russians installed telegraph links to Moscow and St Petersburg during the war, and expanded their rail network south of Moscow after the peace treaty.\n\nThe war also employed modern military tactics, such as trenches and blind artillery fire. The use of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] for shot, coupled with the [[rifling]] of barrels, greatly increased the range and the damage caused by the allied weapons.\n\nThe [[British Army]] system of [[sale of commissions]] came under great scrutiny during the war, especially in connection with the [[Battle of Balaclava]], which saw the ill-fated [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. This scrutiny later led to the abolition of the sale of commissions.\n\nDuring the Crimean war, the first use of steam armored ships in the military history took place. Three [[D\u00e9vastation-class ironclad floating battery|D\u00e9vastation-class floating batteries]] were successfully used against the sea fortress of Kinburn in the autumn of 1855. The direct initiator of this military innovation was the French Emperor Napoleon III. The military threat of the use of this new weapon in the campaign of 1856 contributed to Russia's acceptance of the unfavourable conditions of the Paris treaty of 1856.\n\nScientist Faraday received a proposal from the British government to develop chemical weapons for use in the siege of Sevastopol. Faraday categorically refused and publicly condemned the proposal and his position contributed to the rejection of the development and use of these weapons during the Crimean war.\n\nThe Crimean War was a contributing factor in the Russian [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] in 1861: Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (Nicholas I's son and successor) saw the military defeat of the Russian serf-army by free troops from Britain and France as proof of the need for emancipation.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Moon\n  | first = David\n  | title = The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia, 1762\u20131907\n  | publisher = Pearson Education\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = Harlow, England\n  | pages = 49\u201355\n  | isbn = 978-0-582-29486-8}}</ref> The Crimean War also led to the realisation by the Russian government of its technological inferiority, in military practices as well as weapons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russianwarrior.com/STMMain.htm |title=STMMain |publisher=Russianwarrior.com |date= |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Russian military medicine saw dramatic progress: [[Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov|N.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Pirogov]], known as the father of Russian field surgery, developed the use of [[anaesthetics]], plaster casts, enhanced [[amputation]] methods, and five-stage [[triage]] in Crimea, among other things.\n\nThe war also led to the establishment of the [[Victoria Cross]] in 1856 (backdated to 1854), the British Army's first universal award for valour. 111 medals were awarded.\n\nThe British issued the [[Crimea Medal]] with 5 clasps, and the [[Baltic Medal]], as well as Valour medals, including the newly created [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], the Turkish the [[Turkish Crimea Medal]], the French did not issue a campaign medal, issuing [[M\u00e9daille militaire]] and [[Legion of Honour]] for bravery, Sardinia also issued a [[Sardinian Crimea Medal|medal]].

Because of this work, Tolstoy has been called the world's first [[war correspondent]] (Although Tolstoy was not a correspondent, he was the commander of the artillery battery Bastion number 4, the most dangerous place of defense).\n* In [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' II.3, the Crimean War, especially the [[Battle of Balaclava]], figures prominently. One of the focuses of that dense chapter is a radio program in which Butt & Taff retell an idiosyncratic anecdote from that battle, in which an Irishman named Buckley shot a Russian general.\n* ''Jack Archer: A Tale of the Crimea'' by [[G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Henty]], 1883, a historical novel, details the adventures of two British midshipmen in the Crimean War.\n* The events of the Crimean War are depicted in the 1973 novel ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'' in which the eponymous antihero participates in the battles of Sevastopol and Balaclava.\n* [[Franz Roubaud]].

The [[county seat]] is [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The name is in honor of General [[Philip Schuyler]], one of the four major generals in the Continental Army in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==History==\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Schuyler County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). Tryon County's eastern boundary was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Tryon County's name was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] in honor of the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], replacing the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn 1789, [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of Schuyler and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\n[[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]] counties were two of three counties split off from Montgomery County (the other being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]]) in 1791.\n\nIn 1794, [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] was formed by the splitting of Herkimer County. This county was larger than the present Onondaga County, however, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]], and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties.\n\nOn March 8, 1796, [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] was created, split off from Ontario County. It was larger than the present county, however.\n\nIn 1798, [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]] was formed from Tioga County, but the county at that time was rather larger than the present county, containing a portion of what would later become Schuyler County.\n\nIn 1799, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] was formed by the splitting of Onondaga County. This county was, however, much larger than the present Cayuga County. It then included the present [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties, as well as part of what would become Schuyler County.\n\nIn 1804, [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] was formed by the splitting of Cayuga County. Then in 1817, in turn, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a piece of the remainder of Cayuga County to form [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]].\n\nIn 1823, Steuben County was reduced in size by the combination of a portion of the county with a portion of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] to form [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]].\n\nOn April 17, 1854, portions of [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties  were combined to form Schuyler County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|342|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|328|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (4.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSchuyler County is in the western part of New York State, west of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] at the south end of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]].\n\nThe [[Finger Lakes National Forest]] is in the north part of the county.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] - north\n* [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] - east\n* [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]] - south\n* [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] - west\n* [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] - northwest\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:NY-14.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 14]]\n* [[Image:NY-79.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 79]]\n* [[Image:NY-224.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 224]]\n* [[Image:NY-226.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 226]]\n* [[Image:NY-414.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 414]]\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Finger Lakes National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 18840\n|1870= 18989\n|1880= 18842\n|1890= 16711\n|1900= 15811\n|1910= 14004\n|1920= 13098\n|1930= 12909\n|1940= 12979\n|1950= 14182\n|1960= 15044\n|1970= 16737\n|1980= 17686\n|1990= 18662\n|2000= 19224\n|2010= 18343\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17912\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

As of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the population was 18,343,<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36097.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> making it the second-least populous county in New York. The [[county seat]] is [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The name is in honor of General [[Philip Schuyler]], one of the four major generals in the Continental Army in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==History==\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Schuyler County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). Tryon County's eastern boundary was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Tryon County's name was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] in honor of the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], replacing the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn 1789, [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of Schuyler and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\n[[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]] counties were two of three counties split off from Montgomery County (the other being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]]) in 1791.\n\nIn 1794, [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] was formed by the splitting of Herkimer County. This county was larger than the present Onondaga County, however, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]], and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties.\n\nOn March 8, 1796, [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] was created, split off from Ontario County. It was larger than the present county, however.\n\nIn 1798, [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]] was formed from Tioga County, but the county at that time was rather larger than the present county, containing a portion of what would later become Schuyler County.\n\nIn 1799, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] was formed by the splitting of Onondaga County. This county was, however, much larger than the present Cayuga County. It then included the present [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties, as well as part of what would become Schuyler County.\n\nIn 1804, [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] was formed by the splitting of Cayuga County. Then in 1817, in turn, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a piece of the remainder of Cayuga County to form [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]].\n\nIn 1823, Steuben County was reduced in size by the combination of a portion of the county with a portion of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] to form [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]].\n\nOn April 17, 1854, portions of [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties  were combined to form Schuyler County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|342|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|328|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (4.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSchuyler County is in the western part of New York State, west of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] at the south end of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]].\n\nThe [[Finger Lakes National Forest]] is in the north part of the county.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] - north\n*[[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] - east\n*[[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]] - south\n*[[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] - west\n*[[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] - northwest\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:NY-14.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 14]]\n*[[Image:NY-79.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 79]]\n*[[Image:NY-224.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 224]]\n*[[Image:NY-226.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 226]]\n*[[Image:NY-414.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 414]]\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Finger Lakes National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 18840\n|1870= 18989\n|1880= 18842\n|1890= 16711\n|1900= 15811\n|1910= 14004\n|1920= 13098\n|1930= 12909\n|1940= 12979\n|1950= 14182\n|1960= 15044\n|1970= 16737\n|1980= 17686\n|1990= 18662\n|2000= 19224\n|2010= 18343\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17912\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.
