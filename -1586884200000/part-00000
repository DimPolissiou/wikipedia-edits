This article ''Save Money Through Energy Efficiency'' tells us that the main thing to look for when shopping for a HVAC system is to make sure it runs efficiently. One thing to always look for when in the market of a new HVAC system is the energy guide sticker on the machine<ref name=\":0\" />. Although many might choose to not believe that sticker and that it is just there to help with the sales, history shows that many of the newer HVAC systems with the yellow energy guide stickers help save customers hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on how much they use their HVAC system<ref name=\":0\" />. On the yellow energy guide sticker on many of the newer systems, it displays the average cost to run that machine. Once a customer has found the perfect HVAC system, the customer should run it monthly if it is only put into use during specific times of year. It is recommended that if an HVAC system is not being used each month, that it should be turned on and left running for ten to fifteen minutes<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17999DF0E0D40D80.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. On the other hand if the customer is somebody who runs their HVAC system frequently, it is really important to maintain it. Maintenance on an HVAC system includes changing out the air filter, inspecting the areas where air intake takes place, and check for leaks<ref name=\":1\" />. Doing these three steps are super essential and is the key to keeping an HVAC system running for a long time. A customer should do these three steps every couple of months or when it is suspected problem with the HVAC system<ref name=\":1\" />. Some signs that could lead to a potential problem is if the HVAC system does not provide air cool enough<ref name=\":1\" />. That could be due to a leakage in the cooling fluids. Another sign that could mean that the HVAC system is not running perfectly fine is if there is a bad smell to the air that it is providing. That often means that the air filters need to be replaced. Changing the air filters on an HVAC system is really important because they are exposed to a lot of dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one's home.\n\n== Design, Modeling, and Marketing ==\nMost HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proquest.com/products-services/ebooks/ebooks-main.html|title=Products - Ebook Central\u00ae|website=www.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific setting and/or purpose. When engineers are designing an HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level and experiment with different ways to make HVAC systems as efficient as possible. Even through all the hardships that come from designing a HVAC system, many Mechanical Engineers in particular have a passion for doing. Although it may be hard to get your sales after designing a new HVAC system, marketing the product is very important. The biggest concern that customers have when in the market looking for a new HVAC system is price and reliability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17865A6BD8DFB4D0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. \n\n== HVAC In Homes ==\nDue to the high cost of owning a HVAC system at home, many people do not have one. Although it may be expensive, there are benefits from owning a HVAC system. The main benefit from having an HVAC system installed at home are the health benefits<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/177AAE9EDBD974A0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. During the summer season when it is hot, many people would open the windows to allow fresh air in. However there are contaminants from the air coming into your house that can lead to sickness for you and your family. What an HVAC system would help do is filter out all the dirty particles and contaminants and ensure that you are indeed breathing in fresh air<ref name=\":2\" />. \u00a0\n\n==History==\nIt was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be [[pneumatic]] since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, [[mechanical engineer]]s could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air.\n\nAfter the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in [[ladder logic]] to switch [[Zone damper|damper]]s became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as [[transistor]]s eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Pneumatic to Digital: Open System Conversions|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/images/agiods_files/downloads/Pneumatics_Digital_Conversion_White_Paper.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some [[economies of scale]], as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.\n\n==See also==\n*[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]]\n*[[BACnet]]\n*[[Building Automation]]\n*[[OpenTherm]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{HVAC |state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Building automation]]\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[HVAC]]''' ('''H'''eating, '''V'''entilation and '''A'''ir '''C'''onditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system.

Changing the air filters(1)(3) on an(3) HVAC system is really important because they are(1) exposed to a lot of(1) dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one's(3) home.\n\n== Design, Modeling, and Marketing ==\nMost HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proquest.com/products-services/ebooks/ebooks-main.html|title=Products - Ebook Central\u00ae|website=www.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific(1)(3) setting and/or(1) purpose. When engineers are designing an(1) HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level(1) and experiment with(1) different ways to make HVAC systems(1) as efficient as possible. Even through all the hardships that come from designing a HVAC system, many Mechanical Engineers in particular have a passion for doing.(4) Although it may be hard to get your sales after designing a new HVAC system, marketing the product is very important.(4) The biggest concern that customers have when in the market looking for a new HVAC system is price and reliability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17865A6BD8DFB4D0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. \n\n== HVAC In Homes ==\nDue to the high cost of owning a HVAC system at home, many people do not have one. Although it may be expensive, there are benefits from owning a HVAC system. The main benefit from having an HVAC system installed at home are the health benefits<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/177AAE9EDBD974A0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. During the summer season when it is hot, many people would open the windows to allow fresh air in. However there are contaminants from the air coming into your house that can lead to sickness for you and your family. What an HVAC system would help do is filter out all the dirty particles and contaminants and ensure that you are indeed breathing in fresh air<ref name=\":2\" />. \u00a0\n\n==History==\nIt was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be [[pneumatic]] since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, [[mechanical engineer]]s could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air.\n\nAfter the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in [[ladder logic]] to switch [[Zone damper|damper]]s became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as [[transistor]]s eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Pneumatic to Digital: Open System Conversions|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/images/agiods_files/downloads/Pneumatics_Digital_Conversion_White_Paper.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some [[economies of scale]], as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.\n\n==See also==\n*[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]]\n*[[BACnet]]\n*[[Building Automation]]\n*[[OpenTherm]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{HVAC |state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Building automation]]\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n", "name_user": "Exiao57", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC_control_system"}

He established [[paper mill]]s at Apsley (a former flour mill), [[Nash Mill]] (formerly a mediaeval corn-mill) in 1811 and [[Croxley Green|Croxley]].  The canal at Apsley, Nash Mills and Croxley provided power for the mills and transport for materials and product.<ref name=ashmolean>{{cite web|title=John Dickinson & Co Ltd|url=http://johnevans.ashmolean.org/evans/dickinsons.html|website=Sir John Evans Centenary Project|publisher=[[Ashmolean Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120164524/http://johnevans.ashmolean.org/evans/dickinsons.html|archivedate=20 November 2009|date=2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe mill-house at Nash Mill, called Nash House, became the family home for Dickinson and his new wife Ann (n\u00e9e Grover), whose father Harry Grover supported this business development through his Grover's Bank. Soon Nash Mills was renowned for its production of tough thin paper for Samuel Bagster's \"Pocket Reference Bible\". A major fire in 1813 was a setback, but, being covered by insurance, enabled redevelopment towards large scale production.<ref name=ashmolean />\n\nDuring the 19th century, Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] and his son [[Lewis Evans (collector)|Lewis Evans]] (whose elder brother was the archaeologist Sir [[Arthur Evans]]) both managed the company.\n\nJohn Dickinson & Co. Ltd had their Engineering Department at Nash Mills until 1888, when it was transferred to Apsley Mill.  By the end of the nineteenth century, Nash Mill, which was small and had a reputation for independence, experienced a drop in profitability.  Continuous minor changes were implemented until, in 1926 it underwent improvements with expansion, remodelling and refurbishment.  The ''Lion Brand'' was adopted as the company logo in 1910.<ref name=ashmolean />  Subsidiaries were then formed in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere (thirteen countries in all).\n\n=== Basildon Bond ===\n[[File:Basildon Bond stationery.jpg|thumb|Basildon Bond stationery]]\nThe '''Basildon Bond''' brand of stationery was created by Millington and Sons in 1911.<ref name=\"Room 1983 37\">{{cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Dictionary of trade name origins|year=1983|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-7102-0174-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftrad00room/page/37 37]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftrad00room/page/37}}</ref> The brand is named after [[Basildon Park]], where some of Millington's directors were staying,<ref>{{cite web|author=Basildon Bond|title=History|url=http://www.basildonbond.com/history|publisher=Basildon Bond|accessdate=5 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213728/http://www.basildonbond.com/history|archivedate=7 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and they liked the alliteration of \"Basildon\" and \"[[Bond paper|bond]]\".<ref name=\"Room 1983 37\" /> The Millington & Sons company was acquired by John Dickinson in 1918, who then took over the Basildon Bond brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildonbond.com/history|title=Basildon Bond History|date=2012|accessdate=27 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213728/http://www.basildonbond.com/history|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref> The name \"Basildon Bond\" was used by comedian [[Russ Abbot]] for one of his characters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherrie Hewson|title=Behind the Laughter|publisher=HarperCollins |date=4 Mar 2011|pages=77|chapter=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfVMeVfDtdgC&pg=PT77#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780007412631}}</ref>\n\n=== Innovations ===\nJohn Dickinson patented a method of paper-making in June 1807, that rendered his rivals' techniques (principally the [[Fourdrinier machine]]) obsolete. In 1850, the company started mechanical envelope manufacturing, with gummed envelopes for the first time. The production of fine rag paper on electrically driven machines was a successful innovation at Nash Mill. The company pioneered the production of window envelopes in 1929.\n\n=== Second World War ===\nThe company produced various paper and cardboard products for the war effort, and also branched out into engineering, producing items such as fuel tanks for long range fighter aircraft, 20 mm cannon shells, aircraft fuel pumps, magnetos and spark plugs. The company made the foil strips codenamed ''[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]'' used by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to blind enemy radar.<ref>http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/article/dickinsons-at-war/</ref>\n\n=== Dickinson Robinson Group ===\n\u2033[[Dickinson Robinson Group|Dickinson Robinson Group Ltd]]\u2033 (DRG) was formed out of [[E. S. & A. Robinson]] Packaging of [[Bristol]] and [[John Dickinson (inventor)|John Dickinson]] & Co Ltd. in 1966, creating one of the world's largest stationery and packaging companies. In 1989, the [[Asset stripping|asset-stripper]] [[Roland Franklin]] (Pembridge Investments) acquired DRG (by now including the Royal Sovereign group acquired in 1978) in a leveraged buyout worth \u00a3900 million.\n\n=== Fate ===\nIn 1990 \u2033Pembridge Investments\u2033 sold the paper mills in the group, Nash Mills, Keynsham Paper Mill and Fife Paper Mills, to [[Sappi]] of [[South Africa]]. These mills were subsequently closed by Sappi as were all other acquisitions (Kymmini Oy, Blackburn Mill and Wolvercote Mill) they had made in the UK. \n\nAlso in 1990 \u2033DRG Stationery\u2033 was acquired by \u00b0Biber Holding AG\u00b0 of [[Switzerland]] and renamed \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033. After Biber got insolvent in 1996, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery was sold in the same year to [[James Spicer & Sons|Spicers Ltd]], then a subsidiary of \u2033[[DS Smith]]\u2033, and moved from Apsley to the village of [[Sawston]], south of [[Cambridge]]. In 2005, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033 was purchased by the French stationery manufacturer \u2033[[:fr:Groupe Hamelin|Hamelin Group]]\u2033. Rebranded in 2008 as ''Hamelin Brands'', the company moved to [[Red Lodge, Suffolk]].<ref name=\"Hamelin\" />\n\nIn 1992 \u2033DRG Packaging\u2033 was acquired by \u2033[[Rexam|Bowater]]\u2033. \n\n== Frogmore Paper Mill ==\nJust north of the former Apsley Mill site in [[Hemel Hempstead]] is [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], the world's oldest mechanised paper mill. It was here that Bryan Donkin first demonstrated the paper machine he developed for the Fourdrinier brothers. Now operated by a conservation and education charitable trust, Frogmore Mill is open to the public and incorporates a visitor centre, museum exhibition hall and art gallery as well as continuing to make paper on machine and by hand.\n\n== Black n' Red ==\n[[Image:Black n' red notepad.JPG|thumb|'Black n' Red' book with side binding]]\nBlack n' Red, a brand of books and pads of paper produced by John Dickinson Stationery Limited, featured a striking black and red design.

After meeting [[Rekeson]] in a nightclub and doing a freestyle with him, they decided to form a rap duo, and that's where [[Guerrilla Seca]] (GCK) was born. In those times; approximately in the year 1995, rap was very underground, sounding only \"La Corte.\" Rekeson and Prieto Beretta (then known as Colombia), were dedicated to improvise in the streets, where they caught the attention of Juan Carlos Echendia, who hired them for Subterr\u00e1neo Records, where they made their first record with other underground rap groups, called [[Venezuela Subterr\u00e1nea]].\n\nAfter three years, they decided to release another record, and from the hand of Subterr\u00e1neo Records the second (First solo) disc of Guerrilla Seca was born, which they called \"La Realidad M\u00e1s Real\" (The Most Real Reality), it was quite famous, making them known practically in all of Venezuela, and urging rap to be populaized.\n\nIn 2006, three years after the success of The Most Real Reality, El Prieto and Rekeson had some personal problems and decided to release two albums alone, but at the same time and under the name of GCK so as not to damage the duo. This is how \"Yo contra el mundo\" (Me Against the World) and \"Jugando Vivo\" (Playing Live) were bon. Me Against The World was criticized a lot by the fans of the duo, the opposite of Rekeson's work, which was positively received. But their differences would not last long because two years later they would already be working on their new album.\n\nAlso known for his strong differences between his exmanager Juan Carlos Echendia of the record company Subterr\u00e1neo Records and the deceased singer, [[Mc Ardilla]]. Were the most talked among other conflicts in the genre, breaking through other singers.\n\nIn 2008, they decided to release \"Al Aire Pero Preso\" (Free But Jailed), this time as a duo again, without the help of Subterr\u00e1neo Records, with whom they had some differences. The album was very accepted by the fans, but its success did not last long because one year later El Prieto and Rekeson had differences again, which caused them to separate definitively and culminate with the Guerrilla Seca project, leaving many fans disappointed. However, Rekeson continued to work on his side, as El Prieto did.\n\nMore than 8 million visits has the video \"Petare barrio de pakistan\" (Petare Neighborhood Of [[Pakistan]]), part I, on YouTube.\n\n\"People do not see the positive side of the video, but the negative side, it's not apology, the positive side: we want to give a message to Venezuela and Latin America of what is happening right now in the neighborhood, which is not just Petare Barrio of Pakistan, but it is all of Latin America of Pakistan, because all the neighborhoods of Latin America are equal\", comments El Prieto.\n\n\"In every neighborhood there are good and bad things, everyone plays basketball and football, but suddenly those people who played sports, are victims of a bad play and end up troubled. That's where the mess starts, what on the street we call Pakistan.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that Pakistan is not in Venezuela, that remains in another continent, but people associate that there is a war and that many people die.
