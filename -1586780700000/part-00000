His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

Sonu ([[Kartik Aaryan]]), his best friend, tells him that she is not meant for him, as Titu is loving and caring while Pihu is possessive and callous. Sonu gives an ultimatum to Titu to choose between Pihu and him and Titu chooses his best friend. Six months after his breakup, Titu's family tells him that a family has shown interest in getting him married to their daughter Sweety ([[Neha Kashyap]]). He agrees to meet Sweety and they instantly hit it off. Sweety is extremely caring, sensitive, and clever and is seemingly the 'ideal partner'. Sonu finds this very fishy, though he admits to Titu that she seems nice but he can't really say whether or not the two should marry just yet.\n\nHe later finds out that Sweety was in fact going to marry another man named Rahul but that did not work out as she became dominating, possessive, and once even got drunk and created a scene in Goa. He reveals this to the family, who question Sweety regarding the same and she tells her version of the story in which she does not seem to be at fault. Titu tells Sonu that she had told him all of this in the first meeting itself and he did not want the family to know about all of this. On the night of the engagement, Sonu begins warming up to the idea of Titu and Sweety's wedding. However, Sweety reveals that she in fact is a gold digger and challenges him that she will throw him out of Titu's life and home very soon. Sonu confides in his grandfathers Ghasitaram and Lalu about the revelation. They bet between themselves to see if Sonu can save Titu from Sweety.\n\nTitu is now engaged to Sweety and this brings a lot of compromises for Sonu who was earlier used to living a bachelor's life. Sweety changes their care-taker, she walks in on Sonu making out with a girl. She also manipulates the family members and Titu into buying and naming a house after her and Titu. She turns the house into a vegetarian household and controls Ghasitaram by threatening to reveal his dirty lies to Dadi. Sonu foresees Titu's imminent downfall and to protect him he plans a bachelor party for Titu at Amsterdam, where he arranges his ex-girlfriend Pihu to \"accidentally\" run into them after convincing her that Titu is still in love with her and he wants to help them get back together. They return to India along with Pihu and Sonu is happy to see a bothered Sweety after witnessing the growing closeness between Titu and Pihu. But Sweety reveals the truth to Pihu that it was in fact Sonu who broke Titu and Pihu up in the first place and that Sonu is using her. At this point, Titu is visibly angry with Sonu.\n\nHe once again confides with Ghasitaram and Lalu and they volunteer to sort the situation but Sonu interjects saying his best friend should decide for himself. Sonu helps prepare for the wedding, dances in the Baraat but during the garland ceremony, he makes a final attempt and gives Titu the ultimatum again: 'Whether she is honest or I am dishonest, it's either her or me', and walks away from the wedding, crying. Sweety attempts to turn the tide but Titu, in a fit of epiphany, reveals to Sweety that Sonu's tears reveal that he is a lot more to Titu and firmly announces that if it is between Sonu or her, it will always be his best friend. The scene switches to Sweety standing in the mandap and coming to terms that her malicious tactics cannot always work.\n\nAfter the narrow escape, Sonu, Titu, Ghasitaram, and Lalu are seen sitting and drinking by the pool, whilst Sonu discusses his own marriage plans, to the disgust of others.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Sonu Sharma\n* [[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh]] as Titu Sharma\n* [[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Ishita Raj Sharma]] as Pihu Gaitonde\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Ghasitaram Sharma\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Lalu Kaka, Ghasitaram's best friend\n* Madhumalti Kapoor as Sushmita Devi Sharma, Titu's grandma\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Maya Sharma, Titu's mom\n* [[Pawan Chopra]] as Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, Titu's father\n* [[Deepika Amin]] as Renu Sharma, Sweety's mom\n* [[Rajesh Jais]] as Arjun Sharma, Sweety's father\n* [[Sonnalli Seygall]] as Sonu's girlfriend (Cameo Appearance)\n* Collins Twins in song \"Bom Diggy\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nLuv Ranjan made the announcement about the film through his official [[Twitter]] account on 6 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/luv_ranjan/status/795521914844299265 |title=Official Announcement \u2013 SKTKS |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Luv-Ranjan-teams-up-with-Bhushan-Kumar-for-a-romcom/articleshow/55263070.cms |title=Luv Ranjan teams up with Bhushan Kumar for a romcom |work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> The shooting for the film began on 12 December 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/taran_adarsh/status/808275559499190272 |title=Luv Ranjan's new film launched |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> while the title of the film was officially announced by Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha and Sunny Singh through a [[YouTube]] video on 16 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfk8Y3ULKOk |title=Title Announcement Video \u2013 Luv Ranjan \u2013 Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh,Saurav Singh |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The official trailer of the film was launched on 20 December 2017.<ref name=\"OT\" />\n\n{{cquote|\u201cIn India, they say that marriage happens between two families.

Sonu ([[Kartik Aaryan]]), his best friend, tells him that she is not meant for him, as Titu is loving and caring while Pihu is possessive and callous. Sonu gives an ultimatum to Titu to choose between Pihu and him and Titu chooses his best friend. Six months after his breakup, Titu's family tells him that a family has shown interest in getting him married to their daughter Sweety ([[Nushrat Bharucha]]). He agrees to meet Sweety and they instantly hit it off. Sweety is extremely caring, sensitive, and clever and is seemingly the 'ideal partner'. Sonu finds this very fishy, though he admits to Titu that she seems nice but he can't really say whether or not the two should marry just yet.\n\nHe later finds out that Sweety was in fact going to marry another man named Rahul but that did not work out as she became dominating, possessive, and once even got drunk and created a scene in Goa. He reveals this to the family, who question Sweety regarding the same and she tells her version of the story in which she does not seem to be at fault. Titu tells Sonu that she had told him all of this in the first meeting itself and he did not want the family to know about all of this. On the night of the engagement, Sonu begins warming up to the idea of Titu and Sweety's wedding. However, Sweety reveals that she in fact is a gold digger and challenges him that she will throw him out of Titu's life and home very soon. Sonu confides in his grandfathers Ghasitaram and Lalu about the revelation. They bet between themselves to see if Sonu can save Titu from Sweety.\n\nTitu is now engaged to Sweety and this brings a lot of compromises for Sonu who was earlier used to living a bachelor's life. Sweety changes their care-taker, she walks in on Sonu making out with a girl. She also manipulates the family members and Titu into buying and naming a house after her and Titu. She turns the house into a vegetarian household and controls Ghasitaram by threatening to reveal his dirty lies to Dadi. Sonu foresees Titu's imminent downfall and to protect him he plans a bachelor party for Titu at Amsterdam, where he arranges his ex-girlfriend Pihu to \"accidentally\" run into them after convincing her that Titu is still in love with her and he wants to help them get back together. They return to India along with Pihu and Sonu is happy to see a bothered Sweety after witnessing the growing closeness between Titu and Pihu. But Sweety reveals the truth to Pihu that it was in fact Sonu who broke Titu and Pihu up in the first place and that Sonu is using her. At this point, Titu is visibly angry with Sonu.\n\nHe once again confides with Ghasitaram and Lalu and they volunteer to sort the situation but Sonu interjects saying his best friend should decide for himself. Sonu helps prepare for the wedding, dances in the Baraat but during the garland ceremony, he makes a final attempt and gives Titu the ultimatum again: 'Whether she is honest or I am dishonest, it's either her or me', and walks away from the wedding, crying. Sweety attempts to turn the tide but Titu, in a fit of epiphany, reveals to Sweety that Sonu's tears reveal that he is a lot more to Titu and firmly announces that if it is between Sonu or her, it will always be his best friend. The scene switches to Sweety standing in the mandap and coming to terms that her malicious tactics cannot always work.\n\nAfter the narrow escape, Sonu, Titu, Ghasitaram, and Lalu are seen sitting and drinking by the pool, whilst Sonu discusses his own marriage plans, to the disgust of others.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Sonu Sharma\n* [[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh]] as Titu Sharma\n* [[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Ishita Raj Sharma]] as Pihu Gaitonde\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Ghasitaram Sharma\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Lalu Kaka, Ghasitaram's best friend\n* Madhumalti Kapoor as Sushmita Devi Sharma, Titu's grandma\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Maya Sharma, Titu's mom\n* [[Pawan Chopra]] as Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, Titu's father\n* [[Deepika Amin]] as Renu Sharma, Sweety's mom\n* [[Rajesh Jais]] as Arjun Sharma, Sweety's father\n* [[Sonnalli Seygall]] as Sonu's girlfriend (Cameo Appearance)\n* Collins Twins in song \"Bom Diggy\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nLuv Ranjan made the announcement about the film through his official [[Twitter]] account on 6 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/luv_ranjan/status/795521914844299265 |title=Official Announcement \u2013 SKTKS |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Luv-Ranjan-teams-up-with-Bhushan-Kumar-for-a-romcom/articleshow/55263070.cms |title=Luv Ranjan teams up with Bhushan Kumar for a romcom |work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> The shooting for the film began on 12 December 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/taran_adarsh/status/808275559499190272 |title=Luv Ranjan's new film launched |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> while the title of the film was officially announced by Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha and Sunny Singh through a [[YouTube]] video on 16 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfk8Y3ULKOk |title=Title Announcement Video \u2013 Luv Ranjan \u2013 Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh,Saurav Singh |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The official trailer of the film was launched on 20 December 2017.<ref name=\"OT\" />\n\n{{cquote|\u201cIn India, they say that marriage happens between two families.

'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together.

'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless.

His doctoral dissertation on the image of China in German literature 1871\u20131933 was published 1992.<ref>The book was positively reviewed in the journal ''Hefte f\u00fcr ostasiatische Literatur'' (Cahiers on East Asian Literature, Munich), Nr. 15, Nov. 1993, S.144-146.</ref> This book was inspired by the theoretical work of the Aachen-based Belgian comparatist Hugo Dyserinck that was focused on what Dyserinck called \"imagology\".<ref>As Adrian Hsia noted in 1998, \"imagology is experiencing a renaissance in Europe. A recent example is the doctoral dissertation of a Chinese scholar from Shanghai with the subtitle \u201cEin Beitrag zur komparatistischen Imagologie\u201d (\u201cA Contribution to Comparative Imagology\u201d). As a student of the comparatist Hugo Dyserinck and benefitting from the latter\u2019s erudition, he devotes over 60 pages to delineating all aspects of imagology.

Frankfurt; Berlin; Bern; New York; Paris:  Peter Lang, 1998, p.19.)</ref>\n\n==Career in Germany==\nSince 1992, Fang worked as research fellow at the [[University of Trier]]. While teaching courses on Chinese literature and being engaged in research at the university\"s Institute of Chinese Studies, he also wrote a Post-doctoral thesis on Chinese literature of the post-[[May Fourth Movement|May 4th]] or [[History of the Republic of China|Republican period]] (1919\u20131949).\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Fang was a senior research fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He was engaged in research on \"new knowledge\" in Late Qing China. Professor Michael Lackner advocated acceptance of Fang's post-doctoral thesis as a thesis of [[habilitation]] at the time.\n\nIn 2001, Fang was employed as a senior research fellow at the Department of Chinese Literature and simultaneously at the Department of Communication Theory of [[University of Trier|Trier University]]. He worked in a media-focused research project initiated by both departments.\n\nIn 2002, a slightly revised version of his post-doctoral thesis was accepted as his \"Habilitationsschrift\" by the University of Erlangen (Erlangen Umiversit\u00e4t, today the Erlangen campus of the [[University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg]]). This work, entitled ''Selbstreflexion in der Zeit des Erwachens und des Widerstands \u2013 Moderne Chinesische Literatur 1919-1949'' (Self-reflection in the Period of Awakening and Resistance \u2013 Modern Chinese Literature, 1919-1949), was published by the Harrasowitz publishing company as a volume of a well-reputed series (Lun Wen: Studien zur Geistesgeschichte und Literatur im China, Vol. 7) in 2006. The book was positively reviewed by Prof. [[Wolfgang Kubin]].<ref>Prof. Kubin wrote about this book:  \u201ceine \u2026 gut lesbare Literaturgeschichte, die sch\u00f6n bebildert, klug nach Themen eingeteilt und vor allen Dingen verst\u00e4ndlich ist. \u2026 Wer China im 20.

When he became a \u201cPrivatdozent,\u201d that was the utmost a Chinese citizen could achieve in that country. In fact, there were no full professors of Chinese or of comparative literature (\u201cordentliche Professoren\u201d with unlimited tenure) from China teaching at German universities when Fang was habilitated, and probably there are none today. There have been allegations that this was due to a \u201cclosed-shop policy\u201d of departments of Chinese, Japanese, French, English and so on to keep out foreign citizens who are native speakers of the language taught and who have a profound knowledge of their own culture. Foreigners were employed as lecturers or invited for short periods of a one, two, and perhaps up to four years as \u201cguest professors.\u201d This limits opportunities for scholars from all foreign countries.

While teaching courses on Chinese literature and being engaged in research at the university\"s Institute of Chinese Studies, he also wrote a Post-doctoral thesis on Chinese literature of the post-[[May Fourth Movement|May 4th]] or [[History of the Republic of China|Republican period]] (1919\u20131949).\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Fang was a senior research fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He was engaged in research on \"new knowledge\" in Late Qing China. Professor Michael Lackner advocated acceptance of Fang's post-doctoral thesis as a thesis of [[habilitation]] at the time.\n\nIn 2001, Fang was employed as a senior research fellow at the Department of Chinese Literature and simultaneously at the Department of Communication Theory of [[University of Trier|Trier University]]. He worked in a media-focused research project initiated by both departments.\n\nIn 2002, a slightly revised version of his post-doctoral thesis was accepted as his \"Habilitationsschrift\" by the University of Erlangen (Erlangen Umiversit\u00e4t, today the Erlangen campus of the [[University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg]]). This work, entitled ''Selbstreflexion in der Zeit des Erwachens und des Widerstands \u2013 Moderne Chinesische Literatur 1919-1949'' (Self-reflection in the Period of Awakening and Resistance \u2013 Modern Chinese Literature, 1919-1949), was published by the Harrasowitz publishing company as a volume of a well-reputed series (Lun Wen: Studien zur Geistesgeschichte und Literatur im China, Vol. 7) in 2006. The book was positively reviewed by Prof. [[Wolfgang Kubin]].<ref>Prof. Kubin wrote about this book:  \u201ceine \u2026 gut lesbare Literaturgeschichte, die sch\u00f6n bebildert, klug nach Themen eingeteilt und vor allen Dingen verst\u00e4ndlich ist. \u2026 Wer China im 20.

When he became a \u201cPrivatdozent,\u201d that was the utmost a Chinese citizen could achieve in that country. In fact, there were no full professors of Chinese or of comparative literature (\u201cordentliche Professoren\u201d with unlimited tenure) from China teaching at German universities when Fang was habilitated, and probably there are none today. There have been allegations that this was due to a \u201cclosed-shop policy\u201d of departments of Chinese, Japanese, French, English and so on to keep out foreign citizens who are native speakers of the language taught and who have a profound knowledge of their own culture. Foreigners were employed as lecturers or invited for short periods of a one, two, and perhaps up to four years as \u201cguest professors.\u201d This limits opportunities for scholars from all foreign countries. An important legal basis for this practice was the requirement that \u201cregular\u201d (\u201cordentliche\u201d) professors must be civil servants, without the right to strike. Only German citizens can be employed as civil servants.</ref> \n\nAs a Privatdozent, and simultaneously, until 2006, a senior research fellow, Fang was not only permanently engaged in research while also teaching courses at the Dept. of Chinese Literature.
