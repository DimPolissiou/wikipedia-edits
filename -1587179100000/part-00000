In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'''''], (FoHGC) was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life FOHGC  has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nFoHGC operates in close partnership with the City Council, who owns the site. Two Councillors and the Wyke Area Manager are members of the subcommittee. The East Yorkshire Family History Society at the Carnegie Centre, Hull History Centre and Hymers College are active partners. FoHGC is a subscriber to \u2018Caring for God\u2019s Acre\u2019 and a member of the National Federation of Cemetery Friends. Over time, FoHGC have developed many links to other organisations in the City and beyond and continue to do so. We achieve this by means of an extensive communication policy, which includes the media, publications, talks and guided tours and last but not least by talking to visitors to the Cemetery as well as listening to the local community\u2019s views on the future of this special place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> (CWGC) have strict guidelines on the condition of the CWGC sites (extremely well maintained, proper access, not be overgrown, etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/about-us|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=About the CWGC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and unfortunately, following an inspection of the Hull General Cemetery and in view of its extremley poor condition the CWGC removed and relocated the headstone in the 1960's.

That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

2009)]]\n'''Hull General Cemetery''' was established by a private company in 1847 on Spring Bank, in the west of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'''''], (FoHGC) was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life FOHGC  has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nFoHGC operates in close partnership with the City Council, who owns the site. Two Councillors and the Wyke Area Manager are members of the subcommittee. The East Yorkshire Family History Society at the Carnegie Centre, Hull History Centre and Hymers College are active partners. FoHGC is a subscriber to \u2018Caring for God\u2019s Acre\u2019 and a member of the National Federation of Cemetery Friends. Over time, FoHGC have developed many links to other organisations in the City and beyond and continue to do so. We achieve this by means of an extensive communication policy, which includes the media, publications, talks and guided tours and last but not least by talking to visitors to the Cemetery as well as listening to the local community\u2019s views on the future of this special place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/|title=Friends of Hull General Cemetery - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff. He was only 14 years old when he made his debut for Wolves in a B team game against Walsall Wood in the Walsall Minor League.\n\nHe had been accepted on an eight-month trial by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]], who initially told Wright he was \"too small\" but changed his mind.<ref name=\"sstarball\" /> He made his first team debut for the club aged just 15 in a 2\u20131 win at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in 1939.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

She even suggested using [[liquid nitrogen]] to make [[Ice cream#Using liquid nitrogen|ice cream]].\n\n[[Ice cream soda]] was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The [[sundae|ice cream sundae]] originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories.

In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the [[soda shop]], the [[soda fountain]], and the [[ice cream parlor]]. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]], the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as [[bar]]s and [[bar|saloons]].\n\n[[File:Children in the Ghetto and the Ice-Cream Man. Chicago Ill. (FRONT).jpeg|thumb|Children in [[Maxwell Street|Chicago]] surround an Ice cream vendor in 1909.]]\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap [[refrigeration]] became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors,\u201d and [[Baskin-Robbins]] made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its [[marketing strategy]] (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of [[soft serve|soft ice cream]], which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a [[Tap (valve)|spigot]]. In the United States, chains such as [[Dairy Queen]], [[Carvel (franchise)|Carvel]], and [[Tastee-Freez]] helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various [[food additive]]s into ice cream, most notably the [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizing agent]] [[gluten]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn030331.html |title=Gluten sensitivity more widespread than previously thought |publisher=Colorado State University Extension |author=Pat Kendall, Ph.D., R.D. |date=31 March 2003}}</ref> to which some people have an [[gluten-related disorders|intolerance]].

It is an emulsion which is in the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream, ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give a hard texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/Courses/ce457_527/ce457_pro/Colloidal%20and%20surface%20phenomenal%20aspects%20of%20Ice%20cream.doc|title=Colloidal and surface phenomenal aspects of ice cream|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{clearleft}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:EismaschineBoku.JPG|left|thumb|An [[ice cream maker]] in Boku Europa.]]\nBefore the development of modern [[refrigeration]], ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]], insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. [[Frederic Tudor]] of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/three-ways-to-make-homemade-ice-cream|date=November 21, 2016|title=Three ways to make homemade ice cream|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a {{interlanguage link|sorbeti\u00e8re|fr}} (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing [[latent heat]] and bringing the mixture below the [[freezing point]] of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\n\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\n\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an [[ice cream maker]], an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add [[liquid nitrogen]] to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by [[Heston Blumenthal]] as ideal for home cooks, is to add [[dry ice]] to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Eggs |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series=How to Cook Like Heston |serieslink= |first=Heston |last=Blumenthal |network=[[Channel 4]] | date= |began= |ended= |seriesno=1 |number= 02 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's [[Eagle Brand]] sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings.<ref>Walker, Judy, ''[https://www.nola.com/food/2010/08/post_46.html Make New Orleans flavored ice cream without a fancy machine]'', Nola.com, August 5, 2010</ref> It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of {{convert|5|usgal|l|adj=on}} cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avf4u.html |title=The Vought F4U Corsair |last=Gobel |first=Greg |date=1 May 2015 |website=www.airvectors.net}}</ref> B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Zach |title=DIY Ice Cream in Wartime |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/as-next/cool-side-tropical-warfare-180969515/ |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]] |date=August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Flying Fortresses Double As Ice-Cream Freezers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/03/13/archives/flying-fortresses-double-as-icecream-freezers.html |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 March 1943}}</ref>\n\n== Retail sales ==\n\n[[File:Indonesia bike34.JPG|thumb|A bicycle-based ice cream street vendor in [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nIce cream can be [[mass production|mass-produced]] and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world.

The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an [[ice cream van]]. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"[[ice cream van|ice cream trucks]]\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a [[music box]] noise rather than actual music.\n\n== Ingredients and standard quality definitions ==\n[[File:Black sesame soft ice cream.jpg|thumb|[[Black sesame]] soft ice cream, Japan.]]\n\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\n\nIn the U.S., the [[FDA]] rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:<ref>{{cite web |title=\u00a7135.110 Ice cream and frozen custard. |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=e54b8eb5678cea336e79c0d72e07944d&mc=true&n=sp21.2.135.b&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML |publisher=FDA.gov |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n* greater than 10% milk fat\n* 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the [[protein]]s ([[casein]]s and whey proteins) and [[carbohydrate]]s (lactose) found in milk\n\nIt generally also has:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/ice-cream-mix-ingredients |title=Ice Cream Ingredients |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=Dairy Science and Technology Education Series |first=H.

Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes'' (1891) and ''Fancy Ices'' (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using [[liquid nitrogen]] to make [[Ice cream#Using liquid nitrogen|ice cream]].\n\n[[Ice cream soda]] was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The [[sundae|ice cream sundae]] originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent [[blue law]]s, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], and [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]. Both the [[ice cream cone]] and [[banana split]] became popular in the early 20th century.\n\n[[File:Agnes B Marshall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Agnes Marshall]], \"queen of ices\", instrumental in making ice-cream fashionable.]]\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in ''Mrs. A.B.

In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the [[soda shop]], the [[soda fountain]], and the [[ice cream parlor]]. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]], the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as [[bar]]s and [[bar|saloons]].\n\n[[File:Children in the Ghetto and the Ice-Cream Man. Chicago Ill. (FRONT).jpeg|thumb|Children in [[Maxwell Street|Chicago]] surround an Ice cream vendor in 1909.]]\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap [[refrigeration]] became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors,\u201d and [[Baskin-Robbins]] made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its [[marketing strategy]] (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of [[soft serve|soft ice cream]], which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a [[Tap (valve)|spigot]]. In the United States, chains such as [[Dairy Queen]], [[Carvel (franchise)|Carvel]], and [[Tastee-Freez]] helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various [[food additive]]s into ice cream, most notably the [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizing agent]] [[gluten]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn030331.html |title=Gluten sensitivity more widespread than previously thought |publisher=Colorado State University Extension |author=Pat Kendall, Ph.D., R.D. |date=31 March 2003}}</ref> to which some people have an [[gluten-related disorders|intolerance]].

It is an emulsion which is in the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream, ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give a hard texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/Courses/ce457_527/ce457_pro/Colloidal%20and%20surface%20phenomenal%20aspects%20of%20Ice%20cream.doc|title=Colloidal and surface phenomenal aspects of ice cream|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{clearleft}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:EismaschineBoku.JPG|left|thumb|An [[ice cream maker]] in Boku Europa.]]\nBefore the development of modern [[refrigeration]], ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]], insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. [[Frederic Tudor]] of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/three-ways-to-make-homemade-ice-cream|date=November 21, 2016|title=Three ways to make homemade ice cream|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a {{interlanguage link|sorbeti\u00e8re|fr}} (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing [[latent heat]] and bringing the mixture below the [[freezing point]] of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\n\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\n\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an [[ice cream maker]], an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add [[liquid nitrogen]] to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by [[Heston Blumenthal]] as ideal for home cooks, is to add [[dry ice]] to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Eggs |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series=How to Cook Like Heston |serieslink= |first=Heston |last=Blumenthal |network=[[Channel 4]] | date= |began= |ended= |seriesno=1 |number= 02 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's [[Eagle Brand]] sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings.<ref>Walker, Judy, ''[https://www.nola.com/food/2010/08/post_46.html Make New Orleans flavored ice cream without a fancy machine]'', Nola.com, August 5, 2010</ref> It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of {{convert|5|usgal|l|adj=on}} cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avf4u.html |title=The Vought F4U Corsair |last=Gobel |first=Greg |date=1 May 2015 |website=www.airvectors.net}}</ref> B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Zach |title=DIY Ice Cream in Wartime |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/as-next/cool-side-tropical-warfare-180969515/ |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]] |date=August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Flying Fortresses Double As Ice-Cream Freezers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/03/13/archives/flying-fortresses-double-as-icecream-freezers.html |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 March 1943}}</ref>\n\n== Retail sales ==\n\n[[File:Indonesia bike34.JPG|thumb|A bicycle-based ice cream street vendor in [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nIce cream can be [[mass production|mass-produced]] and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world.

The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an [[ice cream van]]. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"[[ice cream van|ice cream trucks]]\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a [[music box]] noise rather than actual music.\n\n== Ingredients and standard quality definitions ==\n[[File:Black sesame soft ice cream.jpg|thumb|[[Black sesame]] soft ice cream, Japan.]]\n\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\n\nIn the U.S., the [[FDA]] rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:<ref>{{cite web |title=\u00a7135.110 Ice cream and frozen custard. |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=e54b8eb5678cea336e79c0d72e07944d&mc=true&n=sp21.2.135.b&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML |publisher=FDA.gov |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n* greater than 10% milk fat\n* 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the [[protein]]s ([[casein]]s and whey proteins) and [[carbohydrate]]s (lactose) found in milk\n\nIt generally also has:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/ice-cream-mix-ingredients |title=Ice Cream Ingredients |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=Dairy Science and Technology Education Series |first=H.

[[Agnes Marshall]] was a celebrated [[food writing|cookery writer]] of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the [[Royal Institution]].\n\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the [[Syria]]n [[waffle]] booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert J. |last=Weir |url=http://www.historicfood.com/Ice%20Cream%20Cone.htm |title=An 1807 Ice Cream Cone: Discovery and Evidence |publisher=Historicfood.com |year=2004 |accessdate=4 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Linda |last=Stradley |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IceCream/IceCreamCone.htm |title=Ice Cream Cone, History of Ice Cream Cone |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net |year=2004 |accessdate=4 January 2009}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Other frozen desserts ==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRaspberrySherbet.jpg|Raspberry [[sorbet]].\nCulinique Ice Cream Cake.jpg|[[Torte]]-flavoured ice cream.\nBanana flamb\u00e9 - by Jenene.jpg|[[Bananas Foster]] flaming ice cream.\nStrawbeerry kulfi.JPG|[[Kulfi]] from India with strawberry sauce.\n</gallery>\nThe following is a partial list of ice creamy frozen desserts and snacks:\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Ais kacang]]: a dessert in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] made from shaved ice, syrup, and boiled red bean and topped with [[evaporated milk]].

The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available [[dry ice]], and authors such as [[Heston Blumenthal]] have published recipes to produce ice cream and [[sorbet]] using a simple blender.<ref>Heston At Home- Heston Blumenthal</ref>\n\nAnother vendor, ''Creamistry'', creates ice cream from liquid ingredients as customers watch. It has a softer texture than regular ice cream, because ice crystals have less time to form.<ref>{{cite news |title=Creamistry mixes ice cream and science with delicious results |author=Katherine Whaley |date=18 May 2017 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |url=http://abc13.com/food/creamistry-mixes-ice-cream-and-science-with-tasty-results/2007414/ |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n* [[Beer ice cream]]\n* [[Cold-stimulus headache]]\n* [[Ice cream social]]\n* [[List of dairy products]]\n* [[List of desserts]]\n* [[List of ice cream brands]]\n* [[List of ice cream flavors]]\n* [[Milkshake]] (a blended mix of ice cream, milk and syrups)\n* [[Soft serve]]\n* [[Strawberry ice cream]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clearright}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--figure out what this reference pertains to, and add it accordingly using  tags.\n* David, Elizabeth (1994). \"Harvest of the Cold Months: the Social History of Ice and Ices\".
