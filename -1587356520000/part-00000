The capital was [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] during colonial times, and [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]] from 1775 to 1808.  The Governor's office, some other executive offices, and both legislative chambers are in the [[New Hampshire State House|State House]]. The Legislative Office Building is behind the State House in this photograph; the state Supreme Court and other agencies are in an office park on the other (east) side of the [[Merrimack River]].\n\n==Federal representatives==\nLike all states, New Hampshire has two senators in the [[US Senate]]. Based on [[United States Census|U.S. census]] data, [[New Hampshire]] has two members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\n===Congressional districts===\n[[Image:NH-districts-108.JPG|thumb|100px|Congressional districts since 2003]]\nThe [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]] consists of [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll]] and [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford]] counties; [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]], [[Barnstead, New Hampshire|Barnstead]], [[Belmont, New Hampshire|Belmont]], [[Center Harbor, New Hampshire|Center Harbor]], [[Gilford, New Hampshire|Gilford]], [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]], [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]], [[Meredith, New Hampshire|Meredith]] and [[New Hampton, New Hampshire|New Hampton]] in [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap County]]; [[Bedford, New Hampshire|Bedford]], [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and [[Merrimack, New Hampshire|Merrimack]] in [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough County]]; [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] in [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]]; and all of [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]], except [[Atkinson, New Hampshire|Atkinson]], [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] and [[Windham, New Hampshire|Windham]].\n\nThe [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|2nd Congressional District]] is the remainder of the state, lying to the west and north of the 1st District.\n\n(For historical districts, see [[List of United States congressional districts#New Hampshire|here]].)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Congressional Delegation of New Hampshire\n|-\n!

The state awards its electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\n\n==Governing documents==\n===State constitution===\n{{main|New Hampshire Constitution}}\nNew Hampshire is governed by its [[New Hampshire Constitution|constitution]] of 1783.  The constitution is in two parts, a Bill of Rights and a longer Form of Government.  Unlike the [[United States Constitution]], amendments to the New Hampshire Constitution are not set out afterward but edit the text. It is one of the few state constitutions that acknowledge the [[right of revolution]].\n\nThe state constitution is one of the few that do not expressly require [[public education|public schools]].  However, in 1993, the state Supreme Court ruled in the first [[The Claremont Decision|''Claremont'' suit]]<ref>''Claremont School Dist. v. Governor,'' 138 N.H. 183</ref> that a constitutional duty to \"cherish the interest of...public schools\"<ref name=Art83>{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/constitution/lit.html|title=NH.gov - The Official Web Site of New Hampshire State Government - State Constitution, Encouragement of Literature, Trades, Etc.|author=|date=|website=www.nh.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> required the state to define and fund equal public schools statewide.  The legislature complied slowly; in 2008, the Court ended<ref>Londonderry School District SAU #12 v. State of New Hampshire, October 15, 2008</ref> its supervisory role because the original laws had been replaced, but it did not reverse its earlier finding.\n\nThe state constitution has many expressions concerning the character of the people and the criteria that should guide their election of officials.<ref name=Art83 /><ref>[http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html N.H.

(The law now does make these demands of those under 18.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXI/265/265-107-a.htm|title=Section 265:107-a Child Passenger Restraints Required.|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>  A driver does not need to have [[vehicle insurance]] but must provide \"proof of financial responsibility\" to the state after an accident.

New Hampshire also allows the protection of oneself or property with [[stand your ground]] laws expanding the [[castle doctrine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170222/new-hampshire-governor-signs-constitutional-carry-into-law |title=New Hampshire Republican Governor Signs Constitutional Carry Into Law | publisher=NRA |format=Web |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Civil unions in New Hampshire|Civil unions]] became legal in New Hampshire at the start of 2008, giving all the rights associated with marriage in the state to same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Governor Signs Law Establishing Civil Unions in New Hampshire | publisher = Office of the Governor of the State of New Hampshire | date= 2007-05-31 | url =http://www.nh.gov/governor/news/2007/053107.html | language = | accessdate = 2007-07-14| quote =  }}</ref> On January 1, 2010, [[same-sex marriage]] became legal in New Hampshire, overriding the civil union law.\n\nThe state had the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] for specific categories of homicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXII/630/630-1.htm|title=Section 630:1 Capital Murder.|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The last execution was conducted in 1939.

Some advocates of repeal claimed the act would not affect the Addison case, but some opponents asserted that Addison would be spared by asserting his [[due process]] rights.\n\nNew Hampshire was the last state in the country to require public kindergarten, which was mandated in 2007.\n\n===Administrative rules===\nRules that agencies issue, as authorized by statute, are collected in the [[New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules]].\n\n==Branches of government==\n===Legislative===\n{{Main|New Hampshire General Court}}\nThe legislature is called the [[New Hampshire General Court|General Court]].  It consists of the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (400 members) and the [[New Hampshire Senate|Senate]] (24 members).\n\nThe General Court is the fourth-largest legislature in the English-speaking world, behind only the [[British Parliament]], the [[United States Congress]], and the [[Parliament of Canada]] respectively; and the New Hampshire House of Representatives is also the fourth-largest individual chamber (exceeded in number by the [[United States House of Representatives]], the [[British House of Commons]] and the British [[House of Lords]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815211306/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 August 2007|title=NH House of Representatives|author=|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The legislature at one time grew to 443 members due to population growth, but a 1942 constitutional amendment set its size at from 375 through 400 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/abouthouse/housefacts.htm|title=NH House of Representatives|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> There is one representative for about every 3,300 residents.<ref>Divide 400 into the most recent estimate of state population in the article on [[New Hampshire]].</ref> In order for the U.S. Congress to have the same representation, there would need to be approximately 99,000 representatives.\n\nThe legislature apportions legislative seats based on the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. The problem of allocating 400 legislators to 259 municipalities and ensuring equal representation is solved with [[floterial district]]s. For example, a city due more than five representatives but not quite six might elect five representing the city itself, and one more in a floterial district that includes some neighboring towns.\n\nState legislators are paid $200 for their two-year term, plus mileage, effectively making them volunteers. The only other benefits are free use of toll roads and of state-owned resorts. A 2007 survey found that nearly half the members of the House are retired, with an average age over 60.<ref>{{cite news \n  | author = Gordon Fraser\n  | title = N.H.

The executive branch implements and enforces the laws of the state. The Governor is the supreme executive and is afforded the title of [[Excellency|His or Her Excellency]], though the Constitution only provides for \"His Excellency\".\n\nThe [[Governor of New Hampshire]] is [[Chris Sununu]] [[Republican Party (United States)|(R)]].\n\nUnlike most other states, the Governor shares executive power with the Executive Council, which the Governor chairs.<ref>http://www.nh.gov/council/overview.html</ref> The Governor and Executive Council must concur on state contracts over $5,000, high-level agency appointments, and [[pardons]]. The Governor's [[veto]] power and command of the National Guard are not dependent on the Executive Council. The Governor and Councilors are elected to two-year terms. New Hampshire and [[Vermont]] are the only states that still elect governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. Agency appointments are generally for terms of four or five years, which means that a New Hampshire governor is unable to form a new [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] when first taking office.\n\nNew Hampshire does not have a [[Lieutenant Governor]] as most states do.  The Senate President serves as Acting Governor whenever the governor is out of the state or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the office. After the Senate President, the Speaker of the House, [[Secretary of State of New Hampshire|Secretary of State]] and State Treasurer are next in line to serve as Acting Governor.\n\n===Judicial===\n{{Main|Courts of New Hampshire}}\nThe state's highest and the sole appellate court is the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]]. The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and, with the other justices of the supreme court, oversees the judicial branch. New Hampshire has three additional courts and one division: \n*The [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] is the court of general jurisdiction and the only which provides for jury trials in [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases. \n*The state's [[New Hampshire Probate Court|Probate Court]] has jurisdiction over [[trusts]], [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[estate (law)|estates]], [[adoption]]s, termination of parental rights, name changes, [[guardianship]] of incapacitated persons, guardianship of minors, [[Partition (law)|partition]] of property and [[Involuntary commitment|involuntary admissions]]. \n*The [[New Hampshire District Court|District Court]] hears cases involving families, juveniles, minor crimes and [[Infraction|violations]], and civil matters under $25,000. \n*The [[New Hampshire Family Division|Family Division]] has jurisdiction over [[divorce]], [[child custody]], [[child support]], [[domestic violence]], [[guardianship]] of minors, termination of parental rights, abuse/neglect, children in need of services (CHINS), [[juvenile delinquency]], and some [[adoption]]s in [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap]], [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll]], [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos]], [[Grafton County, New Hampshire|Grafton]], [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack]], [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham]], [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford]], and [[Sullivan County, New Hampshire|Sullivan]] Counties.  In the future, the Family Division will expand to [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], and [[Cheshire County, New Hampshire|Cheshire]] counties.  [http://www.courts.state.nh.us/fdpp/index.htm]\n\n==Political parties==\n===Registration===\nThe [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] are the only official parties, for which the state lets a voter register, holds a [[primary election]], and gives a column on the general-election ballot.  Minor parties must poll 4% in a statewide or Congressional election to become official parties, and they lose that designation if they cease to poll 4%.  The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] had official party status from 1990 to 1994, and again from 2016 to 2018.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://lpnh.org/pr/2016/libertarian_party_regains_ballot_access\n|title=Libertarian Party regains Ballot Access\n|publisher=Libertarian Party of New Hampshire\n|accessdate=2016-11-15}}</ref>\n\nA voter who is registered in an official political party cannot vote in a different party's primary election.  A voter who is registered \"[[Independent (voter)|independent]]\" can vote in any party's primary, but is automatically registered in the party in which he or she votes.  The voter can change registration at the polls after voting, and can also change registration in periodic meetings of a town's Supervisors of the Checklist or at the City Clerk's office.  These rules are designed to impede the casting of a cross-over vote for a different party, which may have the goal of sabotaging its nomination.  Registering in a party constrains a voter's choice of ballot, but demonstrates support for the chosen party, and is a prerequisite to being a candidate of that party.\n\n===Primary elections===\nThe famous [[New Hampshire primary]] is summarized in the article on [[New Hampshire#New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]].\n\nNominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate [[primary election]] held in September of election years.  In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:New Hampshire municipalities.png|thumb|right|New Hampshire's 234 local governments and 25 unincorporated areas are organized into ten counties.]]\n\n===Municipalities===\nNew Hampshire comprises 13 [[cities]] and 221 [[town]]s, plus 25 unincorporated places.<ref>The count is as it appears on [http://www.nh.gov/municipal/index.html the nh.gov municipal list] on February 6, 2012.</ref> These governments conform to [[Dillon's Rule]]; that is, they are creatures of the state whose powers are limited to those expressly granted to them by law ([[NH RSA Title III]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-III.htm|title=New Hampshire Statutes - Table of Contents|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Municipalities also have powers necessarily implied by those express powers, and those essential to the local government's existence, but this authority is narrowly construed, in contrast to the practice in most of New England. For statistics on New Hampshire municipalities and comparisons to municipalities elsewhere in New England, see [[New England town]].\n\nCities are governed by Boards of [[Aldermen]] (in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]]) or [[City Council]]s (all other cities).\n\nIn towns, the executive power is the [[Board of Selectmen]], except that some towns, especially larger ones, are governed by a [[Town Council]].  The [[Town Meeting#New Hampshire|Town Meeting]] is effectively the municipal legislature, of which every registered voter is a member.<ref>[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/39/39-mrg.htm RSA 39] governs the timing of, and warrant for, Town Meetings.</ref>  Town Meeting approves, amends, or rejects the items on the [[Warrant (town meeting)|warrant]], which must be published in advance.  Articles can be placed on the warrant by the town's executive board or by citizen petition.\n\nTown Meeting meets annually, normally on the second Tuesday in March, to set the year's budget.  Special Town Meetings can be called to deal with urgent transactions.  The municipal election, which selects town officers for the coming year and may approve changes to local law such as the [[zoning]] ordinance, is thought of as a session of the Town Meeting.\n\n===Government by referendum (SB&nbsp;2)===\n{{Main|Town meeting#Official ballot referenda (SB&nbsp;2)}}\nSince 1995, a town may elect to govern itself by [[Town Meeting#New Hampshire|Official Ballot Referenda]]. This procedure is known as SB&nbsp;2. In such towns, Town Meeting is a \"deliberative\" session that decides the wording of each warrant article; the binding decision is taken by secret ballot at the same time that the officers for the next year are elected. A three-fifths majority is required to adopt or to drop the SB&nbsp;2 procedure.\n\n===School districts===\nSchool districts are separate from municipalities and, if governed by a Town Meeting, have a separate budget and agenda and an elected [[Moderator (town official)|moderator]], who may be different from the municipal moderator.\n\nA school district can be governed by Official Ballot Referenda just as a town can.\n\nTowns often combine into School Administrative Units (SAUs), at least for the management of [[high schools]] and sometimes for all the schools.  If a town is a member of an SAU but operates its own [[elementary school]], voters have a say in both organizations.\n\n===Counties===\nNew Hampshire is divided into 10 [[county|counties]].  Counties have a [[sheriff]]'s department for rural law enforcement and a [[jail]], and may have a [[nursing home]], an extension service for farmers, social services, and other services.  In the smaller towns and unincorporated places, the county may provide services that are usually municipal, such as health inspection of restaurants.\n\nThe legislature of a county is the County Convention, a single chamber consisting of the \"delegation\" of all the state representatives elected from that county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/II/24/24-mrg.htm|title=CHAPTER 24 COUNTY CONVENTIONS|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>  The county's executive power is an elected Board of Commissioners.\n\nFrom time to time, it is proposed that county government be abolished and its functions transferred to the state or to municipalities.<ref>For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.conwaydailysun.com/node/482879/|title=Chandler says county government should be abolished|publisher=Conway Daily Sun|accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>\n\n===Funding===\nAll of the above local governments are funded primarily by a [[property tax]].  The government budget, as voted by the county legislature, the Board of Aldermen or City Council, or the town or school-district town meeting, is divided into the assessed value of all property in the respective region, so that each property owner pays a share based on the property value.<ref name=ASB>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.nh.gov/munc_prop/assessing-board/documents/asbmanualv1_2008.pdf|title=ASB Assessing Reference Manual for Taxpayers, Selectmen, and Assessors|author=|date=|website=nh.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626122410/http://www.revenue.nh.gov/munc_prop/assessing-board/documents/asbmanualv1_2008.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Some or all of the tax is waived for certain types of property (for example, through religious, educational, and charitable exemptions) and for certain classes of taxpayer (such as the poor, elderly, and veterans).  Large parcels will be assessed on their [[current use]] rather than their \"best and highest use\" if the owner cedes development rights.  A property owner receives a tax bill that breaks out [[property tax|millage]] rates that apply to the following:\n*The municipality.\n*Any precinct subject to a higher tax to fund local projects.\n*The school district(s).\n*The county.\n*A statewide property tax.  New Hampshire instituted this tax in 2002, in response to court-ordered statewide equalization of education funding (see [[#State constitution|Claremont suits]]).  The tax, which was lower than the amount previously assessed by school districts, is in theory returned to the school districts, though adjustments by the state legislature create \"donor towns\" and \"recipient towns.\"\n\nThe [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] of a property is controversial, as it directly affects the property tax.  The state requires town-wide reappraisal at least every five years, typically conducted by professional consultants, to ensure that the valuations follow gradual changes in the real estate market and the general price of real estate.<ref name=ASB />  The municipality allows a property owner to challenge a reassessment.\n\nIf assessments in a town were uniformly increased by 10%, the millage would decrease by 10% and the tax to be paid would be unchanged, assuming that the money budgeted by the various government bodies were unchanged.  Even this might be controversial, as the lower millage might eventually be used as an argument for new spending.\n\nSeparately, the fact that the assessment is an estimate of market value means that it reflects intangible aspects of the property, a phenomenon criticized as the so-called [[view tax]].\n\n==Budget==\nNew Hampshire's operating budget is set on a two-year basis, the latest period, July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009, being FY (Fiscal Year) 2008 and FY2009.

The capital was [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] during colonial times, and [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]] from 1775 to 1808.  The Governor's office, some other executive offices, and both legislative chambers are in the [[New Hampshire State House|State House]]. The Legislative Office Building is behind the State House in this photograph; the state Supreme Court and other agencies are in an office park on the other (east) side of the [[Merrimack River]].\n\n==Federal representatives==\nLike all states, New Hampshire has two senators in the [[US Senate]].

The state awards its electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\n\n==Governing documents==\n===State constitution===\n{{main|New Hampshire Constitution}}\nNew Hampshire is governed by its [[New Hampshire Constitution|constitution]] of 1783.  The constitution is in two parts, a Bill of Rights and a longer Form of Government.  Unlike the [[United States Constitution]], amendments to the New Hampshire Constitution are not set out afterward but edit the text. It is one of the few state constitutions that acknowledge the [[right of revolution]].\n\nThe state constitution is one of the few that do not expressly require [[public education|public schools]].  However, in 1993, the state Supreme Court ruled in the first [[The Claremont Decision|''Claremont'' suit]]<ref>''Claremont School Dist. v. Governor,'' 138 N.H. 183</ref> that a constitutional duty to \"cherish the interest of...public schools\"<ref name=Art83>{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/constitution/lit.html|title=NH.gov - The Official Web Site of New Hampshire State Government - State Constitution, Encouragement of Literature, Trades, Etc.|author=|date=|website=www.nh.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> required the state to define and fund equal public schools statewide.  The legislature complied slowly; in 2008, the Court ended<ref>Londonderry School District SAU #12 v. State of New Hampshire, October 15, 2008</ref> its supervisory role because the original laws had been replaced, but it did not reverse its earlier finding.\n\nThe state constitution has many expressions concerning the character of the people and the criteria that should guide their election of officials.<ref name=Art83 /><ref>[http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html N.H.

Some advocates of repeal claimed the act would not affect the Addison case, but some opponents asserted that Addison would be spared by asserting his [[due process]] rights.\n\nNew Hampshire was the last state in the country to require public kindergarten, which was mandated in 2007.\n\n===Administrative rules===\nRules that agencies issue, as authorized by statute, are collected in the [[New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules]].\n\n==Branches of government==\n===Legislative===\n{{Main|New Hampshire General Court}}\nThe legislature is called the [[New Hampshire General Court|General Court]].  It consists of the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (400 members) and the [[New Hampshire Senate|Senate]] (24 members).\n\nThe General Court is the fourth-largest legislature in the English-speaking world, behind only the [[British Parliament]], the [[United States Congress]], and the [[Parliament of Canada]] respectively; and the New Hampshire House of Representatives is also the fourth-largest individual chamber (exceeded in number by the [[United States House of Representatives]], the [[British House of Commons]] and the British [[House of Lords]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815211306/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 August 2007|title=NH House of Representatives|author=|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The legislature at one time grew to 443 members due to population growth, but a 1942 constitutional amendment set its size at from 375 through 400 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/abouthouse/housefacts.htm|title=NH House of Representatives|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> There is one representative for about every 3,300 residents.<ref>Divide 400 into the most recent estimate of state population in the article on [[New Hampshire]].</ref> In order for the U.S. Congress to have the same representation, there would need to be approximately 99,000 representatives.\n\nThe legislature apportions legislative seats based on the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. The problem of allocating 400 legislators to 259 municipalities and ensuring equal representation is solved with [[floterial district]]s. For example, a city due more than five representatives but not quite six might elect five representing the city itself, and one more in a floterial district that includes some neighboring towns.\n\nState legislators are paid $200 for their two-year term, plus mileage, effectively making them volunteers. The only other benefits are free use of toll roads and of state-owned resorts. A 2007 survey found that nearly half the members of the House are retired, with an average age over 60.<ref>{{cite news \n  | author = Gordon Fraser\n  | title = N.H.

The executive branch implements and enforces the laws of the state. The Governor is the supreme executive and is afforded the title of [[Excellency|His or Her Excellency]], though the Constitution only provides for \"His Excellency\".\n\nThe [[Governor of New Hampshire]] is [[Chris Sununu]] [[Republican Party (United States)|(R)]].\n\nUnlike most other states, the Governor shares executive power with the Executive Council, which the Governor chairs.<ref>http://www.nh.gov/council/overview.html</ref> The Governor and Executive Council must concur on state contracts over $5,000, high-level agency appointments, and [[pardons]]. The Governor's [[veto]] power and command of the National Guard are not dependent on the Executive Council. The Governor and Councilors are elected to two-year terms. New Hampshire and [[Vermont]] are the only states that still elect governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. Agency appointments are generally for terms of four or five years, which means that a New Hampshire governor is unable to form a new [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] when first taking office.\n\nNew Hampshire does not have a [[Lieutenant Governor]] as most states do.  The Senate President serves as Acting Governor whenever the governor is out of the state or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the office. After the Senate President, the Speaker of the House, [[Secretary of State of New Hampshire|Secretary of State]] and State Treasurer are next in line to serve as Acting Governor.\n\n===Judicial===\n{{Main|Courts of New Hampshire}}\nThe state's highest and the sole appellate court is the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]]. The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and, with the other justices of the supreme court, oversees the judicial branch. New Hampshire has three additional courts and one division: \n*The [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] is the court of general jurisdiction and the only which provides for jury trials in [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases. \n*The state's [[New Hampshire Probate Court|Probate Court]] has jurisdiction over [[trusts]], [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[estate (law)|estates]], [[adoption]]s, termination of parental rights, name changes, [[guardianship]] of incapacitated persons, guardianship of minors, [[Partition (law)|partition]] of property and [[Involuntary commitment|involuntary admissions]]. \n*The [[New Hampshire District Court|District Court]] hears cases involving families, juveniles, minor crimes and [[Infraction|violations]], and civil matters under $25,000. \n*The [[New Hampshire Family Division|Family Division]] has jurisdiction over [[divorce]], [[child custody]], [[child support]], [[domestic violence]], [[guardianship]] of minors, termination of parental rights, abuse/neglect, children in need of services (CHINS), [[juvenile delinquency]], and some [[adoption]]s in [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap]], [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll]], [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos]], [[Grafton County, New Hampshire|Grafton]], [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack]], [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham]], [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford]], and [[Sullivan County, New Hampshire|Sullivan]] Counties.  In the future, the Family Division will expand to [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], and [[Cheshire County, New Hampshire|Cheshire]] counties.  [http://www.courts.state.nh.us/fdpp/index.htm]\n\n==Political parties==\n===Registration===\nThe [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] are the only official parties, for which the state lets a voter register, holds a [[primary election]], and gives a column on the general-election ballot.  Minor parties must poll 4% in a statewide or Congressional election to become official parties, and they lose that designation if they cease to poll 4%.  The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] had official party status from 1990 to 1994, and again from 2016 to 2018.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://lpnh.org/pr/2016/libertarian_party_regains_ballot_access\n|title=Libertarian Party regains Ballot Access\n|publisher=Libertarian Party of New Hampshire\n|accessdate=2016-11-15}}</ref>\n\nA voter who is registered in an official political party cannot vote in a different party's primary election.  A voter who is registered \"[[Independent (voter)|independent]]\" can vote in any party's primary, but is automatically registered in the party in which he or she votes.  The voter can change registration at the polls after voting, and can also change registration in periodic meetings of a town's Supervisors of the Checklist or at the City Clerk's office.  These rules are designed to impede the casting of a cross-over vote for a different party, which may have the goal of sabotaging its nomination.  Registering in a party constrains a voter's choice of ballot, but demonstrates support for the chosen party, and is a prerequisite to being a candidate of that party.\n\n===Primary elections===\nThe famous [[New Hampshire primary]] is summarized in the article on [[New Hampshire#New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]].\n\nNominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate [[primary election]] held in September of election years.  In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:New Hampshire municipalities.png|thumb|right|New Hampshire's 234 local governments and 25 unincorporated areas are organized into ten counties.]]\n\n===Municipalities===\nNew Hampshire comprises 13 [[cities]] and 221 [[town]]s, plus 25 unincorporated places.<ref>The count is as it appears on [http://www.nh.gov/municipal/index.html the nh.gov municipal list] on February 6, 2012.</ref> These governments conform to [[Dillon's Rule]]; that is, they are creatures of the state whose powers are limited to those expressly granted to them by law ([[NH RSA Title III]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-III.htm|title=New Hampshire Statutes - Table of Contents|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Municipalities also have powers necessarily implied by those express powers, and those essential to the local government's existence, but this authority is narrowly construed, in contrast to the practice in most of New England. For statistics on New Hampshire municipalities and comparisons to municipalities elsewhere in New England, see [[New England town]].\n\nCities are governed by Boards of [[Aldermen]] (in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]]) or [[City Council]]s (all other cities).\n\nIn towns, the executive power is the [[Board of Selectmen]], except that some towns, especially larger ones, are governed by a [[Town Council]].  The [[Town Meeting#New Hampshire|Town Meeting]] is effectively the municipal legislature, of which every registered voter is a member.<ref>[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/39/39-mrg.htm RSA 39] governs the timing of, and warrant for, Town Meetings.</ref>  Town Meeting approves, amends, or rejects the items on the [[Warrant (town meeting)|warrant]], which must be published in advance.  Articles can be placed on the warrant by the town's executive board or by citizen petition.\n\nTown Meeting meets annually, normally on the second Tuesday in March, to set the year's budget.  Special Town Meetings can be called to deal with urgent transactions.  The municipal election, which selects town officers for the coming year and may approve changes to local law such as the [[zoning]] ordinance, is thought of as a session of the Town Meeting.\n\n===Government by referendum (SB&nbsp;2)===\n{{Main|Town meeting#Official ballot referenda (SB&nbsp;2)}}\nSince 1995, a town may elect to govern itself by [[Town Meeting#New Hampshire|Official Ballot Referenda]]. This procedure is known as SB&nbsp;2. In such towns, Town Meeting is a \"deliberative\" session that decides the wording of each warrant article; the binding decision is taken by secret ballot at the same time that the officers for the next year are elected. A three-fifths majority is required to adopt or to drop the SB&nbsp;2 procedure.\n\n===School districts===\nSchool districts are separate from municipalities and, if governed by a Town Meeting, have a separate budget and agenda and an elected [[Moderator (town official)|moderator]], who may be different from the municipal moderator.\n\nA school district can be governed by Official Ballot Referenda just as a town can.\n\nTowns often combine into School Administrative Units (SAUs), at least for the management of [[high schools]] and sometimes for all the schools.  If a town is a member of an SAU but operates its own [[elementary school]], voters have a say in both organizations.\n\n===Counties===\nNew Hampshire is divided into 10 [[county|counties]].  Counties have a [[sheriff]]'s department for rural law enforcement and a [[jail]], and may have a [[nursing home]], an extension service for farmers, social services, and other services.  In the smaller towns and unincorporated places, the county may provide services that are usually municipal, such as health inspection of restaurants.\n\nThe legislature of a county is the County Convention, a single chamber consisting of the \"delegation\" of all the state representatives elected from that county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/II/24/24-mrg.htm|title=CHAPTER 24 COUNTY CONVENTIONS|author=|date=|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>  The county's executive power is an elected Board of Commissioners.\n\nFrom time to time, it is proposed that county government be abolished and its functions transferred to the state or to municipalities.<ref>For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.conwaydailysun.com/node/482879/|title=Chandler says county government should be abolished|publisher=Conway Daily Sun|accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>\n\n===Funding===\nAll of the above local governments are funded primarily by a [[property tax]].  The government budget, as voted by the county legislature, the Board of Aldermen or City Council, or the town or school-district town meeting, is divided into the assessed value of all property in the respective region, so that each property owner pays a share based on the property value.<ref name=ASB>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.nh.gov/munc_prop/assessing-board/documents/asbmanualv1_2008.pdf|title=ASB Assessing Reference Manual for Taxpayers, Selectmen, and Assessors|author=|date=|website=nh.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626122410/http://www.revenue.nh.gov/munc_prop/assessing-board/documents/asbmanualv1_2008.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Some or all of the tax is waived for certain types of property (for example, through religious, educational, and charitable exemptions) and for certain classes of taxpayer (such as the poor, elderly, and veterans).  Large parcels will be assessed on their [[current use]] rather than their \"best and highest use\" if the owner cedes development rights.  A property owner receives a tax bill that breaks out [[property tax|millage]] rates that apply to the following:\n*The municipality.\n*Any precinct subject to a higher tax to fund local projects.\n*The school district(s).\n*The county.\n*A statewide property tax.  New Hampshire instituted this tax in 2002, in response to court-ordered statewide equalization of education funding (see [[#State constitution|Claremont suits]]).  The tax, which was lower than the amount previously assessed by school districts, is in theory returned to the school districts, though adjustments by the state legislature create \"donor towns\" and \"recipient towns.\"\n\nThe [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] of a property is controversial, as it directly affects the property tax.  The state requires town-wide reappraisal at least every five years, typically conducted by professional consultants, to ensure that the valuations follow gradual changes in the real estate market and the general price of real estate.<ref name=ASB />  The municipality allows a property owner to challenge a reassessment.\n\nIf assessments in a town were uniformly increased by 10%, the millage would decrease by 10% and the tax to be paid would be unchanged, assuming that the money budgeted by the various government bodies were unchanged.  Even this might be controversial, as the lower millage might eventually be used as an argument for new spending.\n\nSeparately, the fact that the assessment is an estimate of market value means that it reflects intangible aspects of the property, a phenomenon criticized as the so-called [[view tax]].\n\n==Budget==\nNew Hampshire's operating budget is set on a two-year basis, the latest period, July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009, being FY (Fiscal Year) 2008 and FY2009.  The FY2008 summary is as follows:<ref>http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/LBA/budget/FY0809/HB 1 CategoryTotals.doc</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!Category\n!Expenditures\n|-\n|Health and social services\n|$1,878,467,014\n|-\n|Education\n|$1,458,949,429\n|-\n|Transportation\n|$554,362,042\n|-\n|Administration of justice and public protection\n|$497,656,860\n|-\n|General government\n|$489,197,174\n|-\n|Resource protection and development\n|$232,532,423\n|-\n!Total\n!$5,111,164,942\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!Source\n!Revenue\n|-\n|Federal Funds             \n|$1,478,263,227 \n|-\n|Other Funds                \n|$1,694,862,406 \n|-\n|General Fund                \n|$1,563,832,988 \n|-\n|Highway Funds             \n|$276,455,391 \n|-\n|Turnpikes Funds   \n|$76,575,234\n|-\n|Fish and Game funds     \n|$12,364,494 \n|-\n|Sweepstakes Funds     \n|$8,811,202 \n|-\n!Total          \n!$5,111,164,942\n|}\n\n==Taxation==\nNew Hampshire does not have a general income tax nor a general sales tax like many other U.S. states.  It does have the following taxes:<ref>http://www.nh.gov/revenue/faq/gti-rev.htm</ref>\n\n* Interest & Dividends Tax - 5% [[income tax]]<ref>[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-V-77.htm RSA 77]  Until 1995, the income tax exempted dividends and interest from institutions within the state (and, reciprocally, from institutions in [[Vermont]]).
