Fletcher, insulted, then steals an hourglass that Ellie's late father had given to her, thereby upsetting his sister. \n\nMeanwhile, her mom Katherine Blake is preparing for her impending marriage to her fianc\u00e9 Mike. To add to her stress, she is organizing and catering the wedding. She and Katherine fight and Katherine wishes that Ellie would take more responsibility for herself, while Ellie wishes her mother would understand what it is like to be her. When they start eating, Ellie asks her mother if she can go to the Hunt, but her mother says no because it scares her. When Fletcher's pet bunny goes missing and Mike says he will help find the bunny, Ellie snaps at Mike and says that he is not their dad.  Katherine demands that Ellie say sorry, but Ellie refuses to apologize. Katherine asks Mike to take Fletcher to school, and Ellie storms to her room. \n\nWhen Katherine follows Ellie to her room they fight over the hourglass and switch bodies, which completely frightens them. They realize that Ellie's hourglass switched them and must find the other hourglass but realize that Katherine sold hers and they must find it. So Katherine must go to Ellie's school and Ellie must stay at the house. When Katherine arrived at Ellie's school, Savannah, a mean girl, bullies her and says that she will win the hunt which worries her. Ellie's crush Adam comes to Katherine and ask her for her lunch which confuses Katherine but she gives it to him anyway and he tells her if she is going to the hunt which she asks why nobody cares about their grades but then says why the Hunt is a big deal which he says he wants to live up to his brother and wants to bring people together which Katherine thinks is very mature and goes off to class.\n\nWhen Katherine goes to class she tells Karl and Monica that she won\u2019t be going to the hunt which surprises them. Ellie then goes to the Venue. When Ellie and Mike do their dance it goes awry and Ellie destroys the cake which upsets her helper Tori. Back at Ellie's school Savannah keeps bullying Katherine and dumps her tea on her and when Katherine goes to the restroom to clean up the tea she realizes that Ellie's been keeping a belly button piercing from her which upsets her a lot. When Ellie and Katherine go to Ellie\u2019s parent-teacher conference the principal tells them that when Ellie gets bored she skips class for eleven days which makes Ellie and Katherine both upset. Katherine starts talking about why that's been happening which is about her dad which makes Ellie upset. Then Katherine reveals the piercing which she tells her that she is grounded. \n\nEllie then goes to the hourglass store with Fletcher but realizes its out of business. Then she realizes that if the hourglass is on the hunt then she can go get it. Ellie then asks Katherine to ask Adam to put the hourglass on the hunt which she agrees and tells him but he says no because he is the list master which causes her to say it is a childish game which makes him upset. To make matters worse Karl and Monica come over and say that she has been acting super weird today and says she is focused on the hourglass which makes them upset. \n\nKatherine then takes Fletcher on a walk which she says that parents lie and he will never go to Vegas which makes him upset and to run away. At the rehearsal a lot of things go wrong with Tori quitting, Karl and Monica deciding to ditch \u201cEllie\u201d, and she tells Mike she's rethinking this whole wedding thing which makes Katherine upset. Katherine, Ellie, and Mike realize Fletcher has gone missing and go find him. Adam finds Fletcher and convinces him to return home which he does which Katherine and Ellie are happy to see. Adam then says that he might consider putting the hourglass on the list. \n\nKarl and Monica come over and Ellie begs them to put \u201cEllie\u201d back on the team which they agree and Katherine says that Ellie should do the hunt which she wants to but because she is in her body she says she should do it and then she agrees. \u2018\u2019Cover Magazines\u2019\u2019, the magazine that was going to put Katherine's wedding on there, decides not to but Ellie convinces them to cover the wedding by making seven layer bars which changes their mind and Tori comes back.\n\nEllie then tell Mike that she is not mad at him and loves him and decides to treat Fletcher better. Katherine and the rest go on the hunt and then get the hourglass from a fight from Savannah and wins the hunt. She then goes to the wedding and are supposed to switch but it does not work.

It is home of [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an [[Eastern New Mexico University]] campus. [[Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] is located a few miles northeast of the city on the [[Pecos River]]. [[Bottomless Lakes State Park]] is located {{convert|12|mi}} east of Roswell on [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]].\n\nThe [[Roswell UFO incident]] was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged [[UFO]] was some {{convert|75|mi}} from Roswell and closer to [[Corona, New Mexico|Corona]]. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local [[Roswell Army Air Field]]. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s early [[rocket]]ry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard's [[rocket engine]] development workshop. \u201cAliens\u201d are often spotted running about the streets of the city causing confusion in the locals.\n\nRoswell's tourism industry is based on [[aerospace engineering]] and [[ufology]] museums and businesses, as well as [[extraterrestrial intelligence|alien]]-themed and [[spacecraft]]-themed iconography. The city also relies on New Mexico and Americana related tourism. Local [[American folk music|American folk]] and [[New Mexico music]] performances occur near Pioneer Plaza and in parks around the city. It is a center for [[acequia]]-similar irrigated farming, dairying, and ranching, it also the location of several manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum related facilities.  This regional pride has resulted in Roswell receiving the [[All-America City Award]] multiple times, in 1978\u201379 and 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Historical-museum.jpg|thumb|left|The White family home, built in 1912, is now a museum.]]\n[[image:Chaves County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Chaves County courthouse]]\n[[File:Roswell New Mexico Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Roswell flood]]\nThe first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from [[Missouri]], who attempted to start a settlement {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. [[John Chisum]] had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.\n\nVan C. Smith, a businessman from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two [[adobe]] buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first [[postmaster]]. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.\n\nIn 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the [[Lincoln County War]] (1877\u20131879). A major [[aquifer]] was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.\n\nDuring World War II, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was located in nearby [[Orchard Park, New Mexico|Orchard Park]]. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the [[North Spring River]]. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an [[iron cross]] among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]], presented to the city of Roswell by the [[German Air Force]].\n\nRoswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the [[Walker Air Force Base]] was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a [[retirement community]].\n\n[[Image:RoswellDailyRecordJuly8,1947.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'', July 8, 1947, announcing the \"capture\" of a \"flying saucer\"]]\n[[Image:International UFO Museum and Research Center Roswell New Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[International UFO Museum]]]]\n\nRoswell has benefited from interest in the alleged [[Roswell UFO incident|UFO incident of 1947]]. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an [[extraterrestrial spacecraft]] and its [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a [[conspiracy theory]] regarding a classified program named \"[[Project Mogul|Mogul]]\". Many [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.\n\nRoswell hosted the [[Red Bull Stratos|record-breaking skydive]] by [[Felix Baumgartner]] on October 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| last=Llorca| first=Juan| title=Felix Baumgartner Completes Record-Setting Jump| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/felix-baumgartner-jump-redbull-skydive_n_1965299.html| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=October 17, 2012| date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoswell is located in southeastern [[New Mexico]], approximately {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Pecos River]] and some {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of highlands that rise to the [[Sierra Blanca (New Mexico)|Sierra Blanca]] range. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|70]], [[U.S. Route 285 (New Mexico)|285]] and [[U.S. Route 380 (New Mexico)|380]] intersect in the city.

Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and [[snowfall]] is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and [[Colorado]]) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which can be unpleasant. The North American [[monsoon]] occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe [[thunderstorms]] (with high winds and [[hail]]) and sometimes even [[tornadoes]]. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.\n\nThe record low in Roswell is {{convert|-24|F|0}} on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933.<ref name = NOAA/> The record high is {{convert|114|F|0}} on June

It is home of [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an [[Eastern New Mexico University]] campus. [[Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] is located a few miles northeast of the city on the [[Pecos River]]. [[Bottomless Lakes State Park]] is located {{convert|12|mi}} east of Roswell on [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]].\n\nThe [[Roswell UFO incident]] was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged [[UFO]] was some {{convert|75|mi}} from Roswell and closer to [[Corona, New Mexico|Corona]]. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local [[Roswell Army Air Field]]. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s early [[rocket]]ry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard's [[rocket engine]] development workshop.\n\nRoswell's tourism industry is based on [[aerospace engineering]] and [[ufology]] museums and businesses, as well as [[extraterrestrial intelligence|alien]]-themed and [[spacecraft]]-themed iconography. The city also relies on New Mexico and Americana related tourism. Local [[American folk music|American folk]] and [[New Mexico music]] performances occur near Pioneer Plaza and in parks around the city. It is a center for [[acequia]]-similar irrigated farming, dairying, and ranching, it also the location of several manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum related facilities.  This regional pride has resulted in Roswell receiving the [[All-America City Award]] multiple times, in 1978\u201379 and 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Historical-museum.jpg|thumb|left|The White family home, built in 1912, is now a museum.]]\n[[image:Chaves County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Chaves County courthouse]]\n[[File:Roswell New Mexico Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Roswell flood]]\nThe first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from [[Missouri]], who attempted to start a settlement {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. [[John Chisum]] had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.\n\nVan C. Smith, a businessman from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two [[adobe]] buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first [[postmaster]]. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.\n\nIn 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the [[Lincoln County War]] (1877\u20131879). A major [[aquifer]] was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.\n\nDuring World War II, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was located in nearby [[Orchard Park, New Mexico|Orchard Park]]. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the [[North Spring River]]. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an [[iron cross]] among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]], presented to the city of Roswell by the [[German Air Force]].\n\nRoswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the [[Walker Air Force Base]] was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a [[retirement community]].\n\n[[Image:RoswellDailyRecordJuly8,1947.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'', July 8, 1947, announcing the \"capture\" of a \"flying saucer\"]]\n[[Image:International UFO Museum and Research Center Roswell New Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[International UFO Museum]]]]\n\nRoswell has benefited from interest in the alleged [[Roswell UFO incident|UFO incident of 1947]]. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an [[extraterrestrial spacecraft]] and its [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a [[conspiracy theory]] regarding a classified program named \"[[Project Mogul|Mogul]]\". Many [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.\n\nRoswell hosted the [[Red Bull Stratos|record-breaking skydive]] by [[Felix Baumgartner]] on October 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| last=Llorca| first=Juan| title=Felix Baumgartner Completes Record-Setting Jump| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/felix-baumgartner-jump-redbull-skydive_n_1965299.html| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=October 17, 2012| date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoswell is located in southeastern [[New Mexico]], approximately {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Pecos River]] and some {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of highlands that rise to the [[Sierra Blanca (New Mexico)|Sierra Blanca]] range. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|70]], [[U.S. Route 285 (New Mexico)|285]] and [[U.S. Route 380 (New Mexico)|380]] intersect in the city. US 70 leads northeast {{convert|111|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] and {{convert|117|mi|abbr=on}} west to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]; US 285 leads north {{convert|192|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and south {{convert|76|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]; and US 380 leads east {{convert|134|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Brownfield, Texas]], and west {{convert|164|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Roswell has a total area of {{convert|77.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|77.3|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|km2|order=flip|2}}, or 0.19%, is covered by water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n[[File:Main Street Roswell.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Main Street]]\n\n===Climate===\nRoswell is located in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and has four very distinct seasons, giving it a ''BSk'' or ''BSh'' [[semiarid climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and [[snowfall]] is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and [[Colorado]]) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which can be unpleasant. The North American [[monsoon]] occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe [[thunderstorms]] (with high winds and [[hail]]) and sometimes even [[tornadoes]]. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.\n\nThe record low in Roswell is {{convert|-24|F|0}} on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933.<ref name = NOAA/> The record high is {{convert|114|F|0}} on June

It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]].

Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the [[Palace of Culture|Kulturpalast]] was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were now to be implemented in the GDR. An important principle was: central square - central, cityscape-forming high-rise building and wide main roads. The Palace of Culture was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was aplanned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe but they were not built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure of the Palace of Culture from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", popularly known as ''Kulti'', fulfills the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''.

Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at the time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose.

After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were now to be implemented in the GDR. An important principle was: central square - central, cityscape-forming high-rise building and wide main roads. The Palace of Culture was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was aplanned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe but they were not built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure of the Palace of Culture from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", popularly known as ''Kulti'', fulfills the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterward the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Till 2012 ===\nThe multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could have been transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, three [[water feature]]s were created in 1969 at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres. In each basin there was a jet fountain on an area of 3 by 3 meters, 24 small heap fountains were installed at the edge of the basin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Kunst im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum|publisher=Kulturamt Dresden|year=1996|isbn=|location=Dresden, Germany|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\nDresden Altmarkt Sicht auf Kulturpalast 1 Panorama.jpg|Panorama of the Palace of Culture from the Altmarkt (February 2017)\nAltmarkt dresden kulturpalast2.JPG|View over the Altmarkt to the Kulturpalast, behind it the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], which was rebuilt until 2005 \nAltmarkt (Dresden)2009 06.jpg|Close-up with Frauenkirche and row building at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe, 2009\n20121008160DR DD Blick v d Frauenkirche Richtung Altmarkt.jpg|View from the Frauenkirche over the reborn Neumarkt, Kulturpalast and Altmarkt, 2012\nDD-Kulturpalast-Foyer.jpg|Foyer of the Kulturpalast\nDD-Kulturpalast-Obergeschoss-1.jpg|First floor with the wall frieze 'Unser sozialistisches Leben' ''Our socialist life''\nDD-Kulturpalast-Bibo-1.jpg|Central Library of the Municipal Libraries\n</gallery>\n\n== Conversion ==\n[[File:DD-Kulturpalast-Saal-04.jpg|thumb|The new concert hall]]\n\n=== Conversion planning ===\n[[File:Dresdner Philharmonie im Kulturpalast 2.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Philharmonic and the organ in the renovated Kulturpalast]]\nIn October 2013 the reconstruction work on the Palace of Culture began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2013/10/pm_050.php|title=Baustart im Dresdner Kulturpalast|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The festival hall was to be converted into a pure concert hall with a reduced capacity as a venue for the Dresden Philharmonic. The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library, to be able to abandon the old locations. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building and a use by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo this end, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Palace of Culture was reopened on April 28, 2017 with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at the time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.
