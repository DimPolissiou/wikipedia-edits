Its jurisdiction encompasses the province of [[Pampanga]] and includes the [[suffragan]] sees of lba (Zambales), Tarlac (Tarlac) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nThe seat of the archbishop is the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and it is the mother church of the archdiocese.\n\n==History==\n\n===From diocese to archdiocese===\n\nThe diocese of San Fernando, Pampanga was created on December 11, 1948, through the [[Apostolic Constitution]]  ''Probe Noscitur''; it comprised the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, parts of Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. It was initially a [[suffragan]] of the Archdiocese of Manila. The first bishop was the Most Rev. C\u00e9sar Mar\u00eda Guerrero, DD, a native of [[Manila]]; he received his appointment from the Vatican on May 29, 1949, and was installed on September 8 of the same year. The parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, in the provincial capital town of San Fernando, was selected as the seat of the new diocese; the parish church was thus elevated into a cathedral and was renamed Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n<!-- Taken during a major ordination rite in Floridablanca, dated 17 December 1955 -->Bishop Guerrero established the Mater Boni Consilii (now Mother of Good Counsel) Seminary in 1950 (it was originally in Guagua, then Apalit, before being relocated to its present site in San Fernando): the Cruzada de Penitencia y Caridad (or devotion to the Virgen delos Remedios) in 1952, which continues to this day; and Carmelite Monastery in Angeles in 1956, where on March 14, 1957, he retired due to poor health. He died on March 27, 1961, and was buried beside the monastery chapel, according to his wishes.\n\nEventually the diocese was dismembered when provincial boundaries became more pronounced.   Zambales was established as a prelature on October 18, 1955, Nueva Ecija as a diocese on February 16, 1963, Tarlac as a diocese on May 10, 1963, and Bataan as a diocese on March 17, 1975.\n\nThe Most Rev. Emilio A. Cinense, DD, a native of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, became the second bishop of San Fernando on March 15, 1957.  It was during this term that the Diocese of San Fernando was elevated to a Metropolitan See and Archdiocese; the canonical erection was held on June 15, 1975.  The new archdiocese comprised the whole province of Pampanga with three suffragan dioceses: Tarlac, Iba (Zambales) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nAfter the death of Archbishop Cinense, the Most Rev. Oscar C. Cruz, DD, the native of Balanga, Bataan, and at the time rector of San Carlos Seminary, was appointed second Archbishop of San Fernando on May 22, 1978; he resigned on October 24, 1988.  On January 31, 1989, the Most Rev. Paciano B. Aniceto of Sta. Ana, Pampanga, former rector of the Mother of Good Counsel Seminary and Bishop of Iba, was appointed third (and first Pampanga-born) Archbishop of San Fernando; he was formally installed on March 14, 1989.\n\nOn December 11, 1998, the Golden Jubilee anniversary of its creation as a diocese  the Archdiocese of San Fernando's Cathedral of the Assumption was consecrated and rededicated as The Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, during ceremonies presided over by the papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Antonio Franco, DD.\n\n===Pampanga: first and last Augustinian territory in Luzon===\n[[File:JfChancery0475Lavariafvf_12.JPG|thumb|Bishop David, Archbishop Lavarias, and Apu Ceto]] \nPampanga was not only the pioneer and premiere territory of the Augustinian Order in Luzon but also the last bastion of their evangelical ministry.  They administered Pampanga throughout the 300-year. Spanish colonial period (with a few interruptions) and way beyond it, from 1572 all the way to 1960 when they ceded their last parish to local diocesan clergy (although the last Augustinian priest working in the Kapampangan Region died only as recently as 1993). Here's a brief description of the twenty mission stations (now parishes) founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga; many existed as communities before the Spaniards came.\n\nLUBAO (1572): Maestre de Campo Martin helped P. Fray Gallagos found Lubao in 1572. In 1580 a school of Latin and humanities was established for the inhabitants and missionaries from Spain and Mexico. The first Augustinian printing press in the country was located in this town. Fray Antonio Herrera built the church, the largest in Pampanga.\n\nBETIS (1572): Also founded in 1572 by Fray Fernando Pinto. Although the Libro lists P. Fray Mateo Peralta as its first parroco, P. Fray Jose de la Cruz built the stone church. Early friars describe the faithful of Betis as the most pious and industrious people in the whole province; also, Betis is said to have produced the largest number of priests in the entire country.\n\nMACABEBE (1575): P. Sebastian Molina was Macabebe's first pastor. Equally prominent friars \u2013 PP. Montoya, Tallada, Coronel, Medina, and the illustrious Foronda, all writers in Pampango \u2013 later followed him. The first Pampango book ever published, Vida de san Nicolas do tolentino ( 1614), was written by Fray Tallada when he was minister of this town.\n\nCANDABA (1575): P. Fray Manrique was the pioneer missionary of Candava (Candaba), also founded in 1575. P. Fray Jose de la Cruz, who built the churches of Betis and Mexico, built its stone church only in 1665, P. Fray Estaban Ibeas built its cimborrio (dome), and P. Fray Bravo the tower. The convent was built by the early fathers and later embellished by Fathers Ferrer, Ibeas and Bernando.\n\nBACOLOR (1576): P. Fray Diego Ochoa, author of the first Arte, Vocabulario y Confesionario en Pampango, founded Bacolor. The church is said to be the most beautiful in the province, featuring a grand transept, a project of PP. Fray Manuel Diaz, E. Alvarez and Antonio Bravo, and boasts of having the biggest convent in the whole province. It also has a spacious cemetery equipped with a fine chapel.\n\nMEXICO (1581): The town was initially called Nuevo Mexico, with Fr. Bernardino de Quevedo and Fr. Pedro de Abuyoas first priors. The first church, built by P. Fray Jose de la Cruz in 1665, was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1880, leaving intact the bell tower. Fr. Esteban D. Ibeas had a provisional structure of wood and iron built. The construction of the permanent church, which Fr. Ibeas had planned, was never realized because he was recalled to Manila, and eventually died of cancer of the tongue.\n\nARAYAT (1590): Among the friars assigned to this town were Fathers Contreras, Ven. Bedoya, Ortiz, and Ossorio who built its beautiful church of cut stone and bricks. Fathers Jose Torres and Juan Tarrero later rebuilt it from 1858 to 1892. Arayat owes to Fr. Torres the construction of a beautiful ba\u00f1o (bath house) at the foot of the mountain about two kilometres from the town proper, which is now still a popular destination.\n\nGUAGUA (1590): Fr. Bernardo de Quevedo founded the Guagua mission in 1590 with Fr. Juan de Zabala as first resident priest. One Augustinian wrote that \u201cGuagua occupies the second place among the convents of Pampanga, just after that of Bacolor, although formerly it was number one.\u201d One reason for Guagua's progress was the existence of Parian, an area where natives mixed with Chinese merchants in marriage and in business. Originally these Chinese were refugees from persecution by Gen. Simon de Anda, who had accused them of conniving with the British invaders in 1762 and plotting to assassinate the Governor General and some Augustinians. Another Augustinian likened the Holy Week processions in Guagua as comparable to those held in Spain.\n\nSASMUAN (1590): Sexmoan (Sasmuan) visited Guagua in 1590 and Lubao in 1611. In 1613 its residents complained of the inconvenience of having to go to Lubao for Mass, confession and catechism. In 1615, Fr. Pedro de Zu\u00f1iga was appointed vicar of Sexmoan. Fr. Jose Duque built the first church. Chronicler Fray Gaspar de San Agustin wrote; \u201cThe church is very beautiful, and it is placed under the advocation of Santa Lucia; the convent is of first class too\u201d. Both buildings were swept away by the overflowing river beside them. In 1884, Fr. Toribio Fanjul restored the church.\n\nPORAC (1594): Fr. Mateo de Peralta founded Porac in 1954 by organizing the Negritoes from various rancherias into a single town. In 1607, Porac was annexed to Bacolor as a visit; in 1641, the convent was relieved of its obligation to pay rent to Manila, due to extreme poverty. Fathers Manuel Obregon (1726) and Nicolas Mornier (1735) are credited to have constructed the church, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1863 and restored by Frs. Isidoro Fernando and Esteban Ibeas (while stationed at Sta. Rita). Damaged again in World War II, it was restored by Fr. Daniel Castrillo, the last Augustinian parish priest of Pampanga.\n\nAPALIT (1597): The first prior was Fr. Pedro de Vergara, but it was Fr. Juan Cabello that started the construction of the first church constructed by Fr. Antonio Redondo in 1876-83. It cost P40,000 but Fr. Redondo spent only P 30, 000 through good fiscal management. It is said that the sacristan would go around town ringing a bell, preceded by the brass band, and the townspeople would follow him with their donations of sand and other materials: \u201cThe whole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service or their good wishes.\"\n\nMAGALANG (1605): Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar served as first prior in 1605 in the town's original site at barrio Macapsa. It was transferred to San Bartolome, which was abandoned due to flood in 1856, prompting another transfer to its present site in barrio Talimunduc. Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia supervised the transfer and gave the town its name, San Pedro de Magalang. The first church, built in 1725 in San Bartolome, was destroyed in the flood; the present church was built by Fr. Sarrionandia in 1886.\n\nMINALIN (1614): Minalin was segregated from its matrix Macabebe in 1614; Fr. Miguel de Salda\u00f1a served as the first prior only in 1618. No records exist on when the church was constructed and by whom; only one record states it was finished in 1834. Augustinian figures as well as what appears to be a map of the town marked 1619 are found in the convent, although it is unlikely the map was painted in that year.\n\nSANTA RITA (1726): Fr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Sta. Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Sta. Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Sta. Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustinian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia, in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras.\n\nSAN LUIS (1740): Formerly known as San Nicolas de Cabagsa, in honor of former parish priest Fr. Nicolas de Ordu\u00f1o (cabagsac means a place where fruit bags are bagged out), the town had Fr. Jose Echevarria as first prior in 1742. There is no data on who built the church or when, except that Fr. Isidro Bernardo made great restorations in 1883.\n\nSAN FERNANDO (1754): San Fernando had its first prior, Fr. Sebastian Moreno, only two years after its foundation in 1754. He also started the construction of the church; Fr. Mariano Alafont completed it in 1761. Destroyed in 1828, it was restored by Fr. Pedro Medina and Fr. Antonio Redondo, who had paintings done on the ceiling and the majestic dome built. It was destroyed again in 1899 by Antonio Luna's soldiers, rebuilt, and then burned down in 1939. Architect Fernando Ocampo designed it after the war.\n\nSANTA ANA (1756): As early as 1598, the town (formerly named Pimpin) functioned as visita of Arayat, and it was in 1756 that Augustinians declared it an independent parish with Fr. Lorenzo Guerra as first prior. The church was built in 1853; Fr. Lucas Gonzales added the five-story belfry in 1857. The stones used came from Meycauayan and the wood from Porac and Betis.\n\nSAN SIMON (1771): The town's original name was Virgen del Pilar, after its founder Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes. After the British Occupation of 1762-65, Gen. Simon de Anda renamed it San Simon after his namesake. The Augustinians appointed the first prior only in 1771, Fr. Fernando Medalla. In 1870, Fr. Benito Ubierna built the first church; the revolutionaries burned it down in 1898.\n\nSTO. TOMAS (1793): Formerly called Baliuag, Sto. Tomas parish was founded in 1763, by secular priests, although by 1853 the Augustinians had reclaimed it. The church was built by secular priests and later repaired by Fray Guillermo Masnou. The convent was built later by Fray Tarrero and Fray Bedoya.\n\nANGELES (1820): The former barrio of San Fernando became a separate town in 1829. Initially ministered by a secular priest, Angeles (formerly Culiat) got its first Augustinian prior, Fr. Vicente Andres, in 1843.  Fr. Guillermo Masnou built a wooden church in 1855 to replace the first nipa church, while Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia started the construction in 1860 of the present stone edifice. Fr. Rufino Santos (not the cardinal) did some restoration work in 1893. It took 37 years to complete the church in 1897.\n\nFLORIDABLANCA (1867): Formerly a hacienda of Lubao called San Jose de Calumpaui, the town was renamed Floridablanca after the Count of Floridablanca, Spain (Don Jose Monino), who reportedly owned vast tracts of land in the town.  Fr. Jose Hernandez served as the first prior after the town became a parish in 1867, the same year Calumpaui became Floridablanca.  Fr. Luciano Morron Ylla constructed the church and convent in 1887.  The parish was under the Augustinians until 1960.\n\nMASANTOL (1887): The town, formerly a barrio of Macabebe, was founded in 1887\u2014probably the last one founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga.  It became an independent parish with the name San Miguel de Masantol in 1894.\n\nMABALACAT (1712): This town was formerly a mission of the Augustinians. Due to some insurmountable difficulties it was abandoned and later given to the Augustinian Recollects in 1712. Fr. Andres de San Fulgencio is one of the three friars who pioneered the mission. This was the famous bamboo organ builder Fr. Diego Cera's first assignment after his ordination in Spain. It was turned over to the secular priests in 1898.\n\n==Suffragan dioceses==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga|Diocese of Balanga]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba|Diocese of Iba]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac|Diocese of Tarlac]]\n\n==Prelates of the See==\n\n===Ordinary before the Elevation to a Metropolitan See===\n*1949-1957 (Resigned) : '''Most Rev.

Cristo Del Perdon==\nTrue to form, Kapampangans make a big fuss over appearances, and don't quite know how to solve the problem of two images of the same Virgen\u2014the officially crowned replica and the sidelined antique original. The crusade, in which the image of Our Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios) is taken in daily processions all over Pampanga 365 days a year, is tradition that can be found only in this province of Pampanga. Today, however, the original purpose of the crusade\u2014and the Virgin\u2014have long since been forgotten, the fact that the crusade was established to help in the battle against the Communist [[Hukbalahap]] in the province in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Crusade of Virgen Delos Remedios & Sto. Cristo del Perdon.jpg|thumb|331x331px|The Crusade of the Virgen De Los Remedios & Sto. Cristo Del Perdon during their visit in Christ, Prince of Peace Parish in October 2011.]]\nOn one hand, the original image stays in its original chapel in Baliti, San Fernando City; on the other hand, three replicas have been made to serve as symbols of the crusade. The Baliti faithful recently began actively promoting its shrine as a pilgrimage site, a la Our Lady of Manaoag in Pangasinan. However, for the rest of Pampanga, devotion is mostly directed to the most visible and accessible two pilgrim images which are replicas of the replica; these two images are carried in procession non-stop even to the farthest fishing villages and mountain hamlets. However, the biggest crowds gather (albeit once a year only) around the first replica of the original image, taken out once a year (from the Archdiocesan Chancery) for the annual coronation rites (alternately in San Fernando and Angeles). Thus, there are four identical images of same Virgen de los Remedios: one stationery image in Baliti, another that is kept in the Chancery, taken out only every September 8; and the two pilgrim images constantly going around the province for the crusade. In these processions, the image of the Santo Cristo de Perdon accompanies the Virgen\u2014underscoring the belief of Catholics that the Blessed Virgin helps bring Christ even to the most unreachable people.\n\n=== Beginning of the devotions ===\n\nThis all began when the Diocese of San Fernando was created on December 11, 1948, as a separate diocese away from the Archdiocese of Manila. Its first bishop was the most Rev. Cesar Ma. Guerrero, DD, who immediately identified the most pressing problem of Pampanga as the peasant uprising against the feudal system, fueled by a communist ideology. Socialist mayors were being elected, including those in Angeles and San Fernando; the sonorous sound of the tambuli was a nightly occurrence, and so were parades of peasants waving red flags. The people did go to Mass and pray the Angelus and the rosary, but as Bishop Guerrero said, \u201cAqui en Pampanga hay mucha piedad, pero poca caridad!\u201d (\u201cHere in Pampanga there is much piety, but little charity!\u201d) in the vernacular: \u201cDeng Kapampangan, mapangadi la, pero ali la mapamie!\u201d\n\nAfter much prayer and reflection, to counteract Communist support among the farmers of Pampanga, Bishop Guerrero established the Cruzada ning Pamanisi at Lugud (Crusade of Penance and Charity), during a meeting held on the third Sunday of February 1952 at the San Guillermo Parish in Bacolor, Pampanga. He appointed the parish's co-adjutor Fr. Diosdado Victorio as director of the Cruzada, who chose the image of the Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios), then enshrined in the Virgen de los Remedios Parish (not San Roque parish as previously thought) in Brgy. Baliti, San Fernando, Pampanga, as the image that would accompany the Cruzada across the province. It may be deduced that Bishop Guerrero's choice of patron saint may have been influenced by his personal devotion to Virgen de los Remedios, patron saint of Malate, his former parish. The beautiful, shoulder-borne carriage on which the image was mounted was commissioned by Do\u00f1a Jacinta vda. De Tayag of Bacolor.\n\nThe crusade officially started on May 1, 1952, or four years after the birth of the diocese, in the San Miguel Arcangel Parish on Masantol, the southernmost town of Pampanga. Throughout the year well-attended processions marked the transfer of the image from parish to parish.\n\nPart of the tradition of the crusade was the donation of all alms and goods collected from the previously visited parish to the next parish. Soon, the processions of the Virgen de los Remedios featured truckloads of material goods being distributed to the indigent residents; thus, Kapampangan learned to share their processions and the visits of the Virgen became joyous occasions of replenishing both body and spirit.\n\nWhen all the parishes had been visited by the image of the Virgen, it was the turn of Baliti, its home parish. The people of Baliti sorely missed their beloved Virgin and celebrated their fiesta earlier without the image. When the time came for the crusade's second round of provincial visits, Bishop Guerrero, who had arrived in Baliti to pick up the image, was politely told by Baliti's parish priest, Fr. Generoso Pallasingui, that his parishioners would not the allow the image to leave the parish again. Msgr. Jose de la Cruz, now 92, who was present in the meeting, said in a recent interview that Fr. Pallasigui was quite worried that \u201cblood would flow\u201d if Bishop Guerrero insisted on taking the image away. (Apparently the people and their officials had made their feelings clear to the priest earlier.)\n\nThe people of Baliti graciously lent the image of their parish patroness for the first year of provincial processions. However, when it wasn't returned in time for their barrio fiesta, and when talk circulated that the image did not belong to them anymore but to the entire province, their mood turned from gracious, to sour, to indignation.\n\nMsgr. De la Cruz, then the director of the Kapampangan radio program Ing Siuala nang Maria (The Voice of Mary), recalls that the bishop decided right then and there to have a replica image. \u201cConsidering that Baliti was Huk-infested at that time,\u201d Msgr. De la Cruz said, \u201cthe bishop thought it wise to let the matter rest. Besides, the Cruzada was intended to bring the people closer to God, not away from Him.\u201d He said the people may have reacted to an earlier comment he had made on the program that \u201cno single parish owns the Virgen de los Remedios. Every parish that the image visits owns it in the duration of the visit\". The comment is canonically sound because all church edifices and all artifacts found inside are technically the property of the diocese, and thus, the image is also considered property owned by the diocese and not by the Crusade.\n\n=== Road to the coronation === \n\nThe first replica was thus hastily made by the late Victoriano Siongco of the Catholic Trade Center of San Fernando. It was so well made that when the processions began for the crusade\u2019s year two in late 1953, the people did not realize it was a different image. Bishop Guerrero next decided to apply to the Vatican for permission to have the image canonically crowned.\n\nThe criteria for a canonical coronation of a religious image are: (a) there must be widespread devotion around the image; and (b) the image must have proven antiquity. It was the second criterion that made Msgr. De la Cruz pause. Which of the two images should be canonically crowned, the antique Baliti image or the new replica to which popular devotion had now been transferred? Bishop Guerrero told the priest, \u201cJust pray, Pepe.\u201d\n\nOn the September 8, 1956, more than 70,000 Kapampangans witnessed the canonical coronation of the replica, performed by the Pope's emissary to the Philippines, Msgr. Egidio Vagnozzi, held on capitol grounds in San Fernando.\n\nAfter that, the popular devotion around the crowned image of the Virgen de los Remedios grew even more. Towns that were visited often kept the image way beyond the allotted period, which slowed down the itinerary. It took 10 years or more before the image returned to the same town, which was why people pulled all stops whenever the image finally did come back to their town.\n\nIt was also around this time that the image of Santo Cristo del Perdon (Crucified Christ, Lord of Pardon) was added to accompany the Virgen. There was discussion about which image should come first during the procession, until it was decided to put the Santo Cristo del Perdon first, not only to emphasize that Christ should be first (despite the popular belief that the more important should be last) but also since Cruzada is based on penance; the first image that the people should see must be that of suffering.\n\nIn 1978 or 1979, San Fernando Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz wanted to solve the problem of the extremely slow pace of the Virgen's provincial rounds. There was a proposal to have nine new images made so that each of the diocese's nine vicariates (cluster of parishes based on geography) would have its own Virgen. Msgr. De la Cruz informed Archbishop Cruz that \u201cIt was not the intention of Bishop Guerrero to have multiple images going around.\u201d So the compromise was reached that only two images should go around, one for the northern towns of Pampanga, and one for the southern towns. But then again, the bishop anticipated debate on which group of towns would get the canonically crowned image and which would get the new one. So he solemnly decided to have two new replicas made for the crusade in the north and the south, while the canonically crowned image would stay in the chancery (Bishop's residence) and would come out only every September 8 for the reenactment of the canonical coronation. (Many Kapampangans today erroneously call the annual event \u201ccanonical coronation\u201d, but the Virgen was canonically crowned only once, September 8, 1956; the succeeding September 8 events are all merely anniversaries or reenactments of that first and only canonical coronation.)\n\nThe two new images were introduced during the 1981 reenactment, held in Minalin. (Reenactments were held in whichever town the Virgen was visiting around the time of the anniversary; however, when flooding worsened after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]], especially in the southern towns, the archdiocese decided to hold the reenactment alternately between San Fernando and Angeles, simply because they are the only towns with enough facilities to accommodate the big crowds and because they are relatively dry during the monsoon season.)\n\n==Vicariates==\n\n===Vicariate of St. John Marie Vianney===\nThe [[San Fernando City, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]] and the Town of [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]]\n\n*'''Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish''' - City of San Fernando\n*'''St. Joseph, Husband of Mary Parish (Santuario de San Jose, Arsobispado de Pampanga)''' - San Jose, City of San Fernando\n*'''Sto.

Its jurisdiction encompasses the province of [[Pampanga]] and includes the [[suffragan]] sees of lba (Zambales), Tarlac (Tarlac) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nThe seat of the archbishop is the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and it is the mother church of the archdiocese.\n\n==History==\n\n===From diocese to archdiocese===\n\nThe diocese of San Fernando, Pampanga was created on December 11, 1948, through the [[Apostolic Constitution]]  ''Probe Noscitur''; it comprised the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, parts of Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. It was initially a [[suffragan]] of the Archdiocese of Manila. The first bishop was the Most Rev. C\u00e9sar Mar\u00eda Guerrero, DD, a native of [[Manila]]; he received his appointment from the Vatican on May 29, 1949, and was installed on September 8 of the same year. The parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, in the provincial capital town of San Fernando, was selected as the seat of the new diocese; the parish church was thus elevated into a cathedral and was renamed Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n<!-- Taken during a major ordination rite in Floridablanca, dated 17 December 1955 -->Bishop Guerrero established the Mater Boni Consilii (now Mother of Good Counsel) Seminary in 1950 (it was originally in Guagua, then Apalit, before being relocated to its present site in San Fernando): the Cruzada de Penitencia y Caridad (or devotion to the Virgen delos Remedios) in 1952, which continues to this day; and Carmelite Monastery in Angeles in 1956, where on March 14, 1957, he retired due to poor health. He died on March 27, 1961, and was buried beside the monastery chapel, according to his wishes.\n\nEventually the diocese was dismembered when provincial boundaries became more pronounced.   Zambales was established as a prelature on October 18, 1955, Nueva Ecija as a diocese on February 16, 1963, Tarlac as a diocese on May 10, 1963, and Bataan as a diocese on March 17, 1975.\n\nThe Most Rev. Emilio A. Cinense, DD, a native of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, became the second bishop of San Fernando on March 15, 1957.  It was during this term that the Diocese of San Fernando was elevated to a Metropolitan See and Archdiocese; the canonical erection was held on June 15, 1975.  The new archdiocese comprised the whole province of Pampanga with three suffragan dioceses: Tarlac, Iba (Zambales) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nAfter the death of Archbishop Cinense, the Most Rev. Oscar C. Cruz, DD, the native of Balanga, Bataan, and at the time rector of San Carlos Seminary, was appointed second Archbishop of San Fernando on May 22, 1978; he resigned on October 24, 1988.  On January 31, 1989, the Most Rev. Paciano B. Aniceto of Sta. Ana, Pampanga, former rector of the Mother of Good Counsel Seminary and Bishop of Iba, was appointed third (and first Pampanga-born) Archbishop of San Fernando; he was formally installed on March 14, 1989.\n\nOn December 11, 1998, the Golden Jubilee anniversary of its creation as a diocese  the Archdiocese of San Fernando's Cathedral of the Assumption was consecrated and rededicated as The Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, during ceremonies presided over by the papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Antonio Franco, DD.\n\n===Pampanga: first and last Augustinian territory in Luzon===\n[[File:JfChancery0475Lavariafvf_12.JPG|thumb|Bishop David, Archbishop Lavarias, and Apu Ceto]] \nPampanga was not only the pioneer and premiere territory of the Augustinian Order in Luzon but also the last bastion of their evangelical ministry.  They administered Pampanga throughout the 300-year. Spanish colonial period (with a few interruptions) and way beyond it, from 1572 all the way to 1960 when they ceded their last parish to local diocesan clergy (although the last Augustinian priest working in the Kapampangan Region died only as recently as 1993). Here's a brief description of the twenty mission stations (now parishes) founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga; many existed as communities before the Spaniards came.\n\nLUBAO (1572): Maestre de Campo Martin helped P. Fray Gallagos found Lubao in 1572. In 1580 a school of Latin and humanities was established for the inhabitants and missionaries from Spain and Mexico. The first Augustinian printing press in the country was located in this town. Fray Antonio Herrera built the church, the largest in Pampanga.\n\nBETIS (1572): Also founded in 1572 by Fray Fernando Pinto. Although the Libro lists P. Fray Mateo Peralta as its first parroco, P. Fray Jose de la Cruz built the stone church. Early friars describe the faithful of Betis as the most pious and industrious people in the whole province; also, Betis is said to have produced the largest number of priests in the entire country.\n\nMACABEBE (1575): P. Sebastian Molina was Macabebe's first pastor. Equally prominent friars \u2013 PP. Montoya, Tallada, Coronel, Medina, and the illustrious Foronda, all writers in Pampango \u2013 later followed him. The first Pampango book ever published, Vida de san Nicolas do tolentino ( 1614), was written by Fray Tallada when he was minister of this town.\n\nCANDABA (1575): P. Fray Manrique was the pioneer missionary of Candava (Candaba), also founded in 1575. P. Fray Jose de la Cruz, who built the churches of Betis and Mexico, built its stone church only in 1665, P. Fray Estaban Ibeas built its cimborrio (dome), and P. Fray Bravo the tower. The convent was built by the early fathers and later embellished by Fathers Ferrer, Ibeas and Bernando.\n\nBACOLOR (1576): P. Fray Diego Ochoa, author of the first Arte, Vocabulario y Confesionario en Pampango, founded Bacolor. The church is said to be the most beautiful in the province, featuring a grand transept, a project of PP. Fray Manuel Diaz, E. Alvarez and Antonio Bravo, and boasts of having the biggest convent in the whole province. It also has a spacious cemetery equipped with a fine chapel.\n\nMEXICO (1581): The town was initially called Nuevo Mexico, with Fr. Bernardino de Quevedo and Fr. Pedro de Abuyoas first priors. The first church, built by P. Fray Jose de la Cruz in 1665, was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1880, leaving intact the bell tower. Fr. Esteban D. Ibeas had a provisional structure of wood and iron built. The construction of the permanent church, which Fr. Ibeas had planned, was never realized because he was recalled to Manila, and eventually died of cancer of the tongue.\n\nARAYAT (1590): Among the friars assigned to this town were Fathers Contreras, Ven. Bedoya, Ortiz, and Ossorio who built its beautiful church of cut stone and bricks. Fathers Jose Torres and Juan Tarrero later rebuilt it from 1858 to 1892. Arayat owes to Fr. Torres the construction of a beautiful ba\u00f1o (bath house) at the foot of the mountain about two kilometres from the town proper, which is now still a popular destination.\n\nGUAGUA (1590): Fr. Bernardo de Quevedo founded the Guagua mission in 1590 with Fr. Juan de Zabala as first resident priest. One Augustinian wrote that \u201cGuagua occupies the second place among the convents of Pampanga, just after that of Bacolor, although formerly it was number one.\u201d One reason for Guagua's progress was the existence of Parian, an area where natives mixed with Chinese merchants in marriage and in business. Originally these Chinese were refugees from persecution by Gen. Simon de Anda, who had accused them of conniving with the British invaders in 1762 and plotting to assassinate the Governor General and some Augustinians. Another Augustinian likened the Holy Week processions in Guagua as comparable to those held in Spain.\n\nSASMUAN (1590): Sexmoan (Sasmuan) visited Guagua in 1590 and Lubao in 1611. In 1613 its residents complained of the inconvenience of having to go to Lubao for Mass, confession and catechism. In 1615, Fr. Pedro de Zu\u00f1iga was appointed vicar of Sexmoan. Fr. Jose Duque built the first church. Chronicler Fray Gaspar de San Agustin wrote; \u201cThe church is very beautiful, and it is placed under the advocation of Santa Lucia; the convent is of first class too\u201d. Both buildings were swept away by the overflowing river beside them. In 1884, Fr. Toribio Fanjul restored the church.\n\nPORAC (1594): Fr. Mateo de Peralta founded Porac in 1954 by organizing the Negritoes from various rancherias into a single town. In 1607, Porac was annexed to Bacolor as a visit; in 1641, the convent was relieved of its obligation to pay rent to Manila, due to extreme poverty. Fathers Manuel Obregon (1726) and Nicolas Mornier (1735) are credited to have constructed the church, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1863 and restored by Frs. Isidoro Fernando and Esteban Ibeas (while stationed at Sta. Rita). Damaged again in World War II, it was restored by Fr. Daniel Castrillo, the last Augustinian parish priest of Pampanga.\n\nAPALIT (1597): The first prior was Fr. Pedro de Vergara, but it was Fr. Juan Cabello that started the construction of the first church constructed by Fr. Antonio Redondo in 1876-83. It cost P40,000 but Fr. Redondo spent only P 30, 000 through good fiscal management. It is said that the sacristan would go around town ringing a bell, preceded by the brass band, and the townspeople would follow him with their donations of sand and other materials: \u201cThe whole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service or their good wishes.\"\n\nMAGALANG (1605): Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar served as first prior in 1605 in the town's original site at barrio Macapsa. It was transferred to San Bartolome, which was abandoned due to flood in 1856, prompting another transfer to its present site in barrio Talimunduc. Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia supervised the transfer and gave the town its name, San Pedro de Magalang. The first church, built in 1725 in San Bartolome, was destroyed in the flood; the present church was built by Fr. Sarrionandia in 1886.\n\nMINALIN (1614): Minalin was segregated from its matrix Macabebe in 1614; Fr. Miguel de Salda\u00f1a served as the first prior only in 1618. No records exist on when the church was constructed and by whom; only one record states it was finished in 1834. Augustinian figures as well as what appears to be a map of the town marked 1619 are found in the convent, although it is unlikely the map was painted in that year.\n\nSANTA RITA (1726): Fr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Sta. Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Sta. Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Sta. Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustinian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia, in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras.\n\nSAN LUIS (1740): Formerly known as San Nicolas de Cabagsa, in honor of former parish priest Fr. Nicolas de Ordu\u00f1o (cabagsac means a place where fruit bags are bagged out), the town had Fr. Jose Echevarria as first prior in 1742. There is no data on who built the church or when, except that Fr. Isidro Bernardo made great restorations in 1883.\n\nSAN FERNANDO (1754): San Fernando had its first prior, Fr. Sebastian Moreno, only two years after its foundation in 1754. He also started the construction of the church; Fr. Mariano Alafont completed it in 1761. Destroyed in 1828, it was restored by Fr. Pedro Medina and Fr. Antonio Redondo, who had paintings done on the ceiling and the majestic dome built. It was destroyed again in 1899 by Antonio Luna's soldiers, rebuilt, and then burned down in 1939. Architect Fernando Ocampo designed it after the war.\n\nSANTA ANA (1756): As early as 1598, the town (formerly named Pimpin) functioned as visita of Arayat, and it was in 1756 that Augustinians declared it an independent parish with Fr. Lorenzo Guerra as first prior. The church was built in 1853; Fr. Lucas Gonzales added the five-story belfry in 1857. The stones used came from Meycauayan and the wood from Porac and Betis.\n\nSAN SIMON (1771): The town's original name was Virgen del Pilar, after its founder Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes. After the British Occupation of 1762-65, Gen. Simon de Anda renamed it San Simon after his namesake. The Augustinians appointed the first prior only in 1771, Fr. Fernando Medalla. In 1870, Fr. Benito Ubierna built the first church; the revolutionaries burned it down in 1898.\n\nSTO. TOMAS (1793): Formerly called Baliuag, Sto. Tomas parish was founded in 1763, by secular priests, although by 1853 the Augustinians had reclaimed it. The church was built by secular priests and later repaired by Fray Guillermo Masnou. The convent was built later by Fray Tarrero and Fray Bedoya.\n\nANGELES (1820): The former barrio of San Fernando became a separate town in 1829. Initially ministered by a secular priest, Angeles (formerly Culiat) got its first Augustinian prior, Fr. Vicente Andres, in 1843.  Fr. Guillermo Masnou built a wooden church in 1855 to replace the first nipa church, while Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia started the construction in 1860 of the present stone edifice. Fr. Rufino Santos (not the cardinal) did some restoration work in 1893. It took 37 years to complete the church in 1897.\n\nFLORIDABLANCA (1867): Formerly a hacienda of Lubao called San Jose de Calumpaui, the town was renamed Floridablanca after the Count of Floridablanca, Spain (Don Jose Monino), who reportedly owned vast tracts of land in the town.  Fr. Jose Hernandez served as the first prior after the town became a parish in 1867, the same year Calumpaui became Floridablanca.  Fr. Luciano Morron Ylla constructed the church and convent in 1887.  The parish was under the Augustinians until 1960.\n\nMASANTOL (1887): The town, formerly a barrio of Macabebe, was founded in 1887\u2014probably the last one founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga.  It became an independent parish with the name San Miguel de Masantol in 1894.\n\nMABALACAT (1712): This town was formerly a mission of the Augustinians. Due to some insurmountable difficulties it was abandoned and later given to the Augustinian Recollects in 1712. Fr. Andres de San Fulgencio is one of the three friars who pioneered the mission. This was the famous bamboo organ builder Fr. Diego Cera's first assignment after his ordination in Spain. It was turned over to the secular priests in 1898.\n\n==Suffragan dioceses==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga|Diocese of Balanga]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba|Diocese of Iba]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac|Diocese of Tarlac]]\n\n==Prelates of the See==\n\n===Ordinary before the Elevation to a Metropolitan See===\n*1949-1957 (Resigned) : '''Most Rev.

Cristo Del Perdon==\nTrue to form, Kapampangans make a big fuss over appearances, and don't quite know how to solve the problem of two images of the same Virgen\u2014the officially crowned replica and the sidelined antique original. The crusade, in which the image of Our Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios) is taken in daily processions all over Pampanga 365 days a year, is tradition that can be found only in this province of Pampanga. Today, however, the original purpose of the crusade\u2014and the Virgin\u2014have long since been forgotten, the fact that the crusade was established to help in the battle against the Communist [[Hukbalahap]] in the province in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Crusade of Virgen Delos Remedios & Sto. Cristo del Perdon.jpg|thumb|331x331px|The Crusade of the Virgen De Los Remedios & Sto. Cristo Del Perdon during their visit in Christ, Prince of Peace Parish in October 2011.]]\nOn one hand, the original image stays in its original chapel in Baliti, San Fernando City; on the other hand, three replicas have been made to serve as symbols of the crusade. The Baliti faithful recently began actively promoting its shrine as a pilgrimage site, a la Our Lady of Manaoag in Pangasinan. However, for the rest of Pampanga, devotion is mostly directed to the most visible and accessible two pilgrim images which are replicas of the replica; these two images are carried in procession non-stop even to the farthest fishing villages and mountain hamlets. However, the biggest crowds gather (albeit once a year only) around the first replica of the original image, taken out once a year (from the Archdiocesan Chancery) for the annual coronation rites (alternately in San Fernando and Angeles). Thus, there are four identical images of same Virgen de los Remedios: one stationery image in Baliti, another that is kept in the Chancery, taken out only every September 8; and the two pilgrim images constantly going around the province for the crusade. In these processions, the image of the Santo Cristo de Perdon accompanies the Virgen\u2014underscoring the belief of Catholics that the Blessed Virgin helps bring Christ even to the most unreachable people.\n\n=== Beginning of the devotions ===\n\nThis all began when the Diocese of San Fernando was created on December 11, 1948, as a separate diocese away from the Archdiocese of Manila. Its first bishop was the most Rev. Cesar Ma. Guerrero, DD, who immediately identified the most pressing problem of Pampanga as the peasant uprising against the feudal system, fueled by a communist ideology. Socialist mayors were being elected, including those in Angeles and San Fernando; the sonorous sound of the tambuli was a nightly occurrence, and so were parades of peasants waving red flags. The people did go to Mass and pray the Angelus and the rosary, but as Bishop Guerrero said, \u201cAqui en Pampanga hay mucha piedad, pero poca caridad!\u201d (\u201cHere in Pampanga there is much piety, but little charity!\u201d) in the vernacular: \u201cDeng Kapampangan, mapangadi la, pero ali la mapamie!\u201d\n\nAfter much prayer and reflection, to counteract Communist support among the farmers of Pampanga, Bishop Guerrero established the Cruzada ning Pamanisi at Lugud (Crusade of Penance and Charity), during a meeting held on the third Sunday of February 1952 at the San Guillermo Parish in Bacolor, Pampanga. He appointed the parish's co-adjutor Fr. Diosdado Victorio as director of the Cruzada, who chose the image of the Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios), then enshrined in the Virgen de los Remedios Parish (not San Roque parish as previously thought) in Brgy. Baliti, San Fernando, Pampanga, as the image that would accompany the Cruzada across the province. It may be deduced that Bishop Guerrero's choice of patron saint may have been influenced by his personal devotion to Virgen de los Remedios, patron saint of Malate, his former parish. The beautiful, shoulder-borne carriage on which the image was mounted was commissioned by Do\u00f1a Jacinta vda. De Tayag of Bacolor.\n\nThe crusade officially started on May 1, 1952, or four years after the birth of the diocese, in the San Miguel Arcangel Parish on Masantol, the southernmost town of Pampanga. Throughout the year well-attended processions marked the transfer of the image from parish to parish.\n\nPart of the tradition of the crusade was the donation of all alms and goods collected from the previously visited parish to the next parish. Soon, the processions of the Virgen de los Remedios featured truckloads of material goods being distributed to the indigent residents; thus, Kapampangan learned to share their processions and the visits of the Virgen became joyous occasions of replenishing both body and spirit.\n\nWhen all the parishes had been visited by the image of the Virgen, it was the turn of Baliti, its home parish. The people of Baliti sorely missed their beloved Virgin and celebrated their fiesta earlier without the image. When the time came for the crusade's second round of provincial visits, Bishop Guerrero, who had arrived in Baliti to pick up the image, was politely told by Baliti's parish priest, Fr. Generoso Pallasingui, that his parishioners would not the allow the image to leave the parish again. Msgr. Jose de la Cruz, now 92, who was present in the meeting, said in a recent interview that Fr. Pallasigui was quite worried that \u201cblood would flow\u201d if Bishop Guerrero insisted on taking the image away. (Apparently the people and their officials had made their feelings clear to the priest earlier.)\n\nThe people of Baliti graciously lent the image of their parish patroness for the first year of provincial processions. However, when it wasn't returned in time for their barrio fiesta, and when talk circulated that the image did not belong to them anymore but to the entire province, their mood turned from gracious, to sour, to indignation.\n\nMsgr. De la Cruz, then the director of the Kapampangan radio program Ing Siuala nang Maria (The Voice of Mary), recalls that the bishop decided right then and there to have a replica image. \u201cConsidering that Baliti was Huk-infested at that time,\u201d Msgr. De la Cruz said, \u201cthe bishop thought it wise to let the matter rest. Besides, the Cruzada was intended to bring the people closer to God, not away from Him.\u201d He said the people may have reacted to an earlier comment he had made on the program that \u201cno single parish owns the Virgen de los Remedios. Every parish that the image visits owns it in the duration of the visit\". The comment is canonically sound because all church edifices and all artifacts found inside are technically the property of the diocese, and thus, the image is also considered property owned by the diocese and not by the Crusade.\n\n=== Road to the coronation === \n\nThe first replica was thus hastily made by the late Victoriano Siongco of the Catholic Trade Center of San Fernando. It was so well made that when the processions began for the crusade\u2019s year two in late 1953, the people did not realize it was a different image. Bishop Guerrero next decided to apply to the Vatican for permission to have the image canonically crowned.\n\nThe criteria for a canonical coronation of a religious image are: (a) there must be widespread devotion around the image; and (b) the image must have proven antiquity. It was the second criterion that made Msgr. De la Cruz pause. Which of the two images should be canonically crowned, the antique Baliti image or the new replica to which popular devotion had now been transferred? Bishop Guerrero told the priest, \u201cJust pray, Pepe.\u201d\n\nOn the September 8, 1956, more than 70,000 Kapampangans witnessed the canonical coronation of the replica, performed by the Pope's emissary to the Philippines, Msgr. Egidio Vagnozzi, held on capitol grounds in San Fernando.\n\nAfter that, the popular devotion around the crowned image of the Virgen de los Remedios grew even more. Towns that were visited often kept the image way beyond the allotted period, which slowed down the itinerary. It took 10 years or more before the image returned to the same town, which was why people pulled all stops whenever the image finally did come back to their town.\n\nIt was also around this time that the image of Santo Cristo del Perdon (Crucified Christ, Lord of Pardon) was added to accompany the Virgen. There was discussion about which image should come first during the procession, until it was decided to put the Santo Cristo del Perdon first, not only to emphasize that Christ should be first (despite the popular belief that the more important should be last) but also since Cruzada is based on penance; the first image that the people should see must be that of suffering.\n\nIn 1978 or 1979, San Fernando Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz wanted to solve the problem of the extremely slow pace of the Virgen's provincial rounds. There was a proposal to have nine new images made so that each of the diocese's nine vicariates (cluster of parishes based on geography) would have its own Virgen. Msgr. De la Cruz informed Archbishop Cruz that \u201cIt was not the intention of Bishop Guerrero to have multiple images going around.\u201d So the compromise was reached that only two images should go around, one for the northern towns of Pampanga, and one for the southern towns. But then again, the bishop anticipated debate on which group of towns would get the canonically crowned image and which would get the new one. So he solemnly decided to have two new replicas made for the crusade in the north and the south, while the canonically crowned image would stay in the chancery (Bishop's residence) and would come out only every September 8 for the reenactment of the canonical coronation. (Many Kapampangans today erroneously call the annual event \u201ccanonical coronation\u201d, but the Virgen was canonically crowned only once, September 8, 1956; the succeeding September 8 events are all merely anniversaries or reenactments of that first and only canonical coronation.)\n\nThe two new images were introduced during the 1981 reenactment, held in Minalin. (Reenactments were held in whichever town the Virgen was visiting around the time of the anniversary; however, when flooding worsened after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]], especially in the southern towns, the archdiocese decided to hold the reenactment alternately between San Fernando and Angeles, simply because they are the only towns with enough facilities to accommodate the big crowds and because they are relatively dry during the monsoon season.)\n\n==Vicariates==\n\n===Vicariate of St. John Marie Vianney===\nThe [[San Fernando City, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]] and the Town of [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]]\n\n*'''Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish''' - City of San Fernando\n*'''St. Joseph, Husband of Mary Parish (Santuario de San Jose, Arsobispado de Pampanga)''' - San Jose, City of San Fernando\n*'''Sto.

[[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]].\n\nThe previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]]. Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. \n\nBeginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7).\n\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n\n*(This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling).\n* The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.\n\n[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13 doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs.\n \nOn 21 March 2017 Velocity announced that China had left the show to \"pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. \n\nAs since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for [[Motor Trend.\n\n[[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on Wheeler Dealers and according to China it would seem it found its production too expensive.\n\nPaul Brackley the series technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.\n\n=== Guest appearances on other shows ===\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of [[Overhaulin]] where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\nAs of 27 April 2020 175 episodes have been shown covering 175 different vehicles with 9 recap episodes.\n\n=== ''Wheeler Dealers'' ===\nFor series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two half an hour episodes (including ad breaks). From series 7 onwards, each car was covered in a single 60 minute episode.\n\n===Series Overview===\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n\n| color1       = #000066\n| link1        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 1 (2003)\n| episodes1    = 6\n| start1       = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n| end1         = {{End date|2003|11|11|df=y}}\n\n| color2       = #BFBFBF\n| link2        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 2 (2004)\n| episodes2    = 6\n| start2       = {{Start date|2004|8|10|df=y}}\n| end2         = {{End date|2004|9|16|df=y}}\n\n| color3       = #545480\n| link3        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 3 (2005)\n| episodes3    = 6\n| start3       = {{Start date|2005|8|23|df=y}}\n| end3         = {{End date|2005|9|27|df=y}}\n\n| color4       = #006161\n| link4        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 4 (2006)\n| episodes4    = 6\n| start4       = {{Start date|2006|8|29|df=y}}\n| end4         = {{End date|2006|10|3|df=y}}\n\n| color5       = #A69482\n| link5        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 5 (On the Road) (2008)\n| episodes5    = 6\n| start5       = {{Start date|2008|10|28|df=y}}\n| end5         = {{End date|2008|12|6|df=y}}\n\n| color6       = #559CDA\n| link6        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 6 (2009)\n| episodes6    = 10\n| start6       = {{Start date|2009|5|5|df=y}}\n| end6         = {{End date|2009|11|17|df=y}}\n\n| color7       = #44546A\n| link7        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 7 (2010)\n| episodes7    = 10\n| start7       = {{Start date|2010|5|4|df=y}}\n| end7         = {{End date|2010|11|9|df=y}}\n\n| color8       = #F0E68C\n| link8        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 8 (2011)\n| episodes8    = 10\n| start8       = {{Start date|2011|4|5|df=y}}\n| end8         = {{End date|2011|11|1|df=y}}\n\n| color9       = #99324F\n| link9        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 9 (2013)\n| episodes9    = 15\n| start9       = {{Start date|2012|3|20|df=y}}\n| end9         = {{End date|2012|11|6|df=y}}\n\n| color10       = #3A3838\n| link10        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 10 (2013)\n| episodes10    = 12\n| start10       = {{Start date|2013|2|19|df=y}}\n| end10         = {{End date|2013|10|22|df=y}}\n\n| color11       = #36614B\n| link11        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 11 (2014)\n| episodes11    = 14\n| start11       = {{Start date|2014|3|17|df=y}}\n| end11         = {{End date|2014|10|13|df=y}}\n\n| color12       = #694F6E\n| link12        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 12 (2015)\n| episodes12    = 18\n| start12       = {{Start date|2015|3|23|df=y}}\n| end12         = {{End date|2015|10|19|df=y}}\n\n| color13       = #006161\n| link13        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 13 (2016-17)\n| episodes13    = 16\n| start13       = {{Start date|2016|5|9|df=y}}\n| end13         = {{End date|2017|1|16|df=y}}\n\n| color14       = #a6b7ce\n| link14        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 14 (2017)\n| episodes14    = 16\n| start14       = {{Start date|2017|10|5|df=y}}\n| end14         = {{End date|2018|5|31|df=y}}\n\n| color15       = #83cebf\n| link15        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 15 (2018)\n| episodes15    = 25\n| start15       = {{Start date|2018|10|3|df=y}}\n| end15         = {{End date|2019|12|3|df=y}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% | Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#9932CC;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 1 (2013)|1]]'''\n| 6\n| 2 April 2013\n| 7 May 2013\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#25262a;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 2 (2014)|2]]'''\n| 6\n| 6 August 2014\n| 10 September 2014\n|}\n\n=== Sweden Special ===\nOn 2 April 2012, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] version of the Discovery Channel aired a special episode called ''Wheeler Dealers Sverige Special'' (''Wheeler Dealers Sweden Special'').

if they are not in running order or street legal.\n\nBrewer has used a [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006\u2013present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] to travel around England since series 9 (2012). Vehicles used prior to series 9 include a dark turquoise [[Nissan Primera#P12 (2002\u20132008)|Nissan Primera Estate]], a blue [[Subaru Legacy (fourth generation)|Subaru Legacy Estate]], a red [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|Honda Accord Tourer]], a black [[SsangYong Rexton#Second generation (2006\u2013present)|SsangYong Rexton II]], a dark blue [[SsangYong Kyron]], a black [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 4 / LR4|Land Rover Discovery 4]], a blue [[Nissan X-Trail]] and a light blue [[Ford Kuga]]. For Series 8a, he used a black X-Trail. For Series 12b, he used a white [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter#Second generation|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] to transport the [[Messerschmitt KR200]] back to the workshop.\n\nWhen Brewer travelled to [[France]] in series 5 to purchase a Citro\u00ebn DS, he rented a French-registered black [[Opel Zafira]]; he rented a [[Opel Zafira#Zafira B|newer version of the Zafira]] when he returned to France to buy the Renault Alpine A310 in series 9a. Brewer used a French-registered silver [[Toyota Corolla Verso#Third generation (2004-2009)|Toyota Corolla Verso]] when he returned to buy the Citro\u00ebn 2CV in series 11a. When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citro\u00ebn HY.\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\nFor ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]]. Taxicabs featured in the series included a yellow Hindustan Ambassador Grand and a green and yellow [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] RE in India, a black LTC TX4 in the UK, a black [[Toyota Crown Comfort]] in Japan, a yellow and red Volkswagen Sedan Type 1 in Mexico, a white [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] in Australia, a white Chevrolet Onix Sedan in Brazil, a yellow [[Dodge Charger]] in Texas, and a yellow [[Fiat 600 Multipla]] in Italy.

In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.\n\nFor the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].\n\n=== Intro/segment vehicles ===\nThe opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:\n\n*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far\n*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT\n*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa\n*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL\n*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4\n*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3\n*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3\n*Series 8b: Dodge Charger\n*Series 9a: Fiat Dino\n*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra\n\nSeries 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Deals on Wheels]]'' - An earlier programme presented by Brewer with a similar premise.\n*''[[Salvage Hunters]]'' - A similar concept series, related to buying and selling [[antique]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com}} ([[Discovery (UK and Ireland)|Discovery UK]])\n* {{Official website|https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/wheeler-dealers/}} ([[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]])\n* {{YouTube|u=WheelerDealersTV|''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''|suffix='}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Automotive television series]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 1963 film|The Wheeler Dealers}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name = Wheeler Dealers\n | image = WheelerDealersTitleCard.jpg\n | caption = Series 14 title card\n | show_name_2 = Wheeler Dealers: On the Road <small>(Series 5)</small>\n | country = [[United Kingdom]]\n | network = [[Discovery Real Time]] <small>(2003-2010)</small><br/>[[Discovery Channel]] <small>(2011-2015)</small><br/> [[Motor Trend]]<small> (2016-present)</small>\n | creator = Daniel Allum<br/>Michael Wood\n | presenter = [[Mike Brewer]]<br/>[[Edd China]] <small>(Series 1-13)</small><br/>[[Ant Anstead]] <small>(Series 14-)</small>\n | num_series = 15 <small>(Wheeler Dealers)</small><br>2 <small>(Trading Up)</small>\n | num_episodes = 173 + 9 Specials <small>(as of 13 April 2020) </small> \n | list_episodes = List of Wheeler Dealers episodes\n | runtime = 30 minutes <small>(Series 1-6)</small><br/>60 minutes <small>(Series 7-)</small>\n | first_aired = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n | last_aired = present\n | company    = Attaboy TV <small>(Series 1-12)</small><br/>[[Discovery Studios]]\n | opentheme = [[Balaclava]]\n | theme_music_composer = [[The Wideboys]]\n}}\nWheeler Dealers is a British television series originally produced by Attaboy TV for the [[Discovery Channel]] in the UK and [[Motor Trend]] in the U.S. The programme is fronted by car enthusiast [[Mike Brewer]]. [[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]].\n\nThe previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]]. Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. \n\nBeginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7).\n\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n\n*(This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling).\n* The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit.

For Series 8a, he used a black X-Trail. For Series 12b, he used a white [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter#Second generation|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] to transport the [[Messerschmitt KR200]] back to the workshop.\n\nWhen Brewer travelled to [[France]] in series 5 to purchase a Citro\u00ebn DS, he rented a French-registered black [[Opel Zafira]]; he rented a [[Opel Zafira#Zafira B|newer version of the Zafira]] when he returned to France to buy the Renault Alpine A310 in series 9a. Brewer used a French-registered silver [[Toyota Corolla Verso#Third generation (2004-2009)|Toyota Corolla Verso]] when he returned to buy the Citro\u00ebn 2CV in series 11a. When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citro\u00ebn HY.\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\nFor ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].

In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.\n\nFor the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].\n\n=== Intro/segment vehicles ===\nThe opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:\n\n*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far\n*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT\n*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa\n*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL\n*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4\n*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3\n*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3\n*Series 8b: Dodge Charger\n*Series 9a: Fiat Dino\n*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra\n\nSeries 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux.

{"title_page": "Aftermath of World War II", "text_new": "{{short description|Period after the conclusion of World War II}}\n{{TopicTOC-World War II |width=19.5em}}\n{{WWII timeline |width=19.5em}}\n\nThe '''Aftermath of World War II''' was the beginning of a new era, defined by the decline of all [[European colonial empires]] and simultaneous rise of two [[superpower]]s: the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[United States]] (USA). [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], the US and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in the [[Cold War]], so called because it never resulted in overt, declared hot war between the two powers but was instead characterized by [[espionage]], [[political subversion]] and [[proxy war]]s. [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] were rebuilt through the American [[Marshall Plan]] whereas [[Central and Eastern Europe]] fell under the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] and eventually behind an \"[[Iron Curtain]]\". Europe was divided into a US-led [[Western Bloc]] and a Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The War also saw a [[nuclear arms race]] between the two superpowers; part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \"hot\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a [[mutually assured destruction]] standoff.\n\nAs a consequence of the war, the Allies created the [[United Nations]], an organization for international cooperation and diplomacy, similar to the [[League of Nations]]. Members of the United Nations agreed to outlaw [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]] in an attempt to avoid a [[World War III|third world war]]. The devastated great powers of Western Europe formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which later evolved into the [[European Economic Community]] and ultimately into the current [[European Union]]. This effort primarily began as an attempt to avoid another war between [[Germany]] and [[France]] by economic cooperation and integration, and a common market for important natural resources.\n\nThe end of the war also increased the rate of [[decolonization]] from the great powers with independence being granted to [[India]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Indonesia]] (from the [[Netherlands]]), [[the Philippines]] (from the [[US]]) and a number of [[Arab nations]], primarily from specific rights which had been granted to great powers from [[League of Nations Mandate]]s in the [[Aftermath of World War I|post World War I-era]] but often having existed ''[[de facto]]'' well before this time.  Independence for the nations of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] came more slowly.\n\nThe aftermath of World War II also saw the rise of communist influence in Southeast Asia, with the [[People's Republic of China]], as the [[Chinese Communist Party]] emerged [[Chinese Communist Revolution|victorious]] from the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.\n\n==Immediate effects==\n[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]: Result of the war.]]\nAt the end of the war, millions of people were dead and millions more homeless, the European economy had collapsed, and much of the European industrial infrastructure had been destroyed. The [[Soviet Union]], too, had been heavily affected. In response, in 1947, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]] devised the \"European Recovery Program\", which became known as the [[Marshall Plan]]. Under the plan, during 1948\u20131952 the [[United States government]] allocated US$13 billion (US${{inflation|US|13|1947|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars) for the reconstruction of [[Western Europe]].\n\n===United Kingdom===\nBy the end of the war, the economy of the [[United Kingdom]] was one of severe privation. More than a quarter of its national wealth had been consumed. Until the introduction in 1941 of [[Lend-Lease]] aid from the US, the UK had been spending its assets to purchase American equipment including aircraft and ships\u2014over \u00a3437 million on aircraft alone. Lend-lease came just before its reserves were exhausted. Britain had placed 55% of its total labour force into war production.\n\nIn spring 1945, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] withdrew from the wartime coalition government, in an effort to oust [[Winston Churchill]], forcing a [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. Following a landslide victory, Labour held more than 60% of the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and formed a new government on 26 July 1945 under [[Clement Attlee]].\n\nBritain's war debt was described by some in the American administration as a \"millstone round the neck of the British economy\". Although there were suggestions for an international conference to tackle the issue, in August 1945 the U.S. announced unexpectedly that the Lend-Lease programme was to end immediately.\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal of American Lend-Lease support to Britain on 2 September 1945 dealt a severe blow to the plans of the new government. It was only with the completion of the [[Anglo-American loan]] by the United States to Great Britain on 15 July 1946 that some measure of economic stability was restored. However, the loan was made primarily to support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's policies for domestic welfare reforms and the [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of key industries. Although the loan was agreed on reasonable terms, its conditions included what proved to be damaging fiscal conditions for [[Pound sterling|Sterling]]. From 1946-1948, the UK introduced bread rationing, which it had never done during the war.<ref>''The Dominance of England'', Dorothy Crisp, Holborn Publishing, London 1960, pages 22-26,</ref><ref>''The World at War'', Mark Arnold-Foster, BCA London, 1974, pages 286-7,</ref><ref>''Sunday Times'' Sept 6, 2009 by Max Hastings</ref><ref>''A History of the American People'', Paul Johnson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1997, pages 647-8</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:Stalingrad aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins in Stalingrad, typical of the destruction in many Soviet cities.]]\nThe Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in the war against Germany. The Soviet population [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|decreased by about 27 million]] during the war; of these, 8.7 million were combat deaths. The 19 million non-combat deaths had a variety of causes: starvation in the [[siege of Leningrad]]; conditions in German prisons and concentration camps; mass shootings of civilians; harsh labour in German industry; famine and disease; conditions in Soviet camps; and service in German or German-controlled military units fighting the Soviet Union.<ref>Michael Ellman and S.

Many ex-POWs and young civilians were also conscripted to serve in the Red Army. Others worked in labour battalions to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war.<ref>Edwin Bacon, \"Glasnost and the Gulag: New Information on Soviet Forced Labour around World War II\", ''Soviet Studies'', Vol. 44, No. 6 (1992), pp. 1069-1086.</ref><ref>Michael Ellman, \"Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments\", ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 54, No. 7 (Nov., 2002), pp. 1151-1172</ref>\n[[File:World War II Casualties2.svg|thumb|250px|[[World War II casualties]]]]\nThe economy had been devastated. Roughly a quarter of the Soviet Union's capital resources were destroyed, and industrial and agricultural output in 1945 fell far short of pre-war levels. To help rebuild the country, the Soviet government obtained limited credits from Britain and Sweden; it refused assistance offered by the United States under the Marshall Plan. Instead, the Soviet Union coerced Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe to supply machinery and raw materials. Germany and former Nazi satellites made reparations to the Soviet Union. The reconstruction programme emphasised heavy industry to the detriment of agriculture and consumer goods. By 1953, steel production was twice its 1940 level, but the production of many consumer goods and foodstuffs was lower than it had been in the late 1920s.<ref>Glenn E. Curtis, ed.

In the east, the [[Sudetenland]] reverted to Czechoslovakia following the [[European Advisory Commission]]'s decision to delimit German territory to be the territory it held on 31 December 1937. Close to one-quarter of pre-war (1937) Germany was ''de facto'' annexed by the Allies; roughly 10 million Germans were either expelled from this territory or not permitted to return to it if they had fled during the war. The remainder of Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, coordinated by the [[Allied Control Council]]. The [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]] was detached and put in economic union with France in 1947. In 1949, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was created out of the Western zones. The Soviet zone became the [[German Democratic Republic]].\n\nGermany paid [[German reparations for World War II|reparations]] to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, mainly in the form of [[Industrial plans for Germany|dismantled factories]], [[Forced labor of Germans after World War II|forced labour]], and coal. The German [[standard of living]] was to be reduced to its 1932 level.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852764,00.html Cost of Defeat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311212814/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852764,00.html |date=2007-03-11 }} Time Magazine Monday, 8 April 1946</ref> Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the US and Britain pursued an \"intellectual reparations\" programme to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. The value of these amounted to around US$10 billion{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=206}} (US${{inflation|US|10|1946|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars). In accordance with the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], reparations were also assessed from the countries of [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Finland]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-753, Krefeld, Hungerwinter, Demonstration.jpg|thumb|The hunger-winter of 1947. Thousands protest against the disastrous food situation.

The Allies' immediate post-war \"industrial disarmament\" plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial de-industrialization. The first industrial plan for Germany, signed in 1946, required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50% of its 1938 level. Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951. By 1950, equipment had been removed from 706 [[manufacturing plants]], and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons.<ref>Frederick H.

From 1948 onwards West Germany also became a minor beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. Volunteer organisations had initially been forbidden to send food, but in early 1946 the [[Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany]] was founded. The prohibition against sending [[CARE Package]]s to individuals in Germany was rescinded on 5 June 1946.\n\nAfter the German surrender, the [[International Red Cross]] was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting POW camps for Germans inside Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was also permitted to visit and assist prisoners in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. The Red Cross petitioned successfully for improvements to be made in the living conditions of German POWs.<ref>Staff.

At first this was undertaken in an extralegal manner by the French Resistance (called the ''\u00e9puration sauvage'', \"wild purge\"). French women who had had romantic liaisons with German soldiers were publicly humiliated and had their heads shaved. There were also a wave of summary executions estimated to have killed about 10,000 people.\n\nWhen the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] established control, the ''\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale'' (\"legal purge\") began. There were no international war crimes trials for French collaborators, who were tried in the domestic courts. Approximately 300,000 cases were investigated; 120,000 people were given various sentences including 6,763 death sentences (of which only 791 were carried out). Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later.\n\n===Italy===\nThe 1947 [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] spelled the end of the [[Italian Empire|Italian colonial empire]], along with other border revisions. The 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] compelled Italy to pay $360 million (US dollars at 1938 prices) in [[war reparations]]: $125 million to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], $105 million to [[Greece]], $100 million to the [[Soviet Union]], $25 million to [[Ethiopia]] and $5 million to [[Albania]]. In the 1946 [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italian constitutional referendum]] the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian monarchy]] was abolished, having been associated with the deprivations of the war and the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] rule, especially in the [[Northern Italy|North]].\n\nUnlike in Germany and Japan, no [[war crimes tribunal]]s were held against Italian military and political leaders, though the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian resistance]] [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] some of them (such as [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]) at the end of the war; the [[Togliatti amnesty]], taking its name from the Communist Party secretary at the time, pardoned all wartime common and political crimes in 1946.\n\n===Austria===\nThe [[Federal State of Austria]] had been annexed by Germany in 1938 ([[Anschluss]], this union was banned by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). Austria (called [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] by the Germans) was separated from Germany and divided into four zones of occupation. With the [[Austrian State Treaty]], these zones reunited in 1955 to become the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]].\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}\n[[Image:TTPI-locatormap.png|thumb|The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in [[Micronesia]] administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986]]\n[[File:342-usaf-11034 Medical Aspects-Hiroshima.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=152|Silent film footage taken in [[Hiroshima]] in March 1946 showing survivors with severe burns and [[keloid]] scars.]]\nAfter the war, the Allies rescinded Japanese pre-war annexations such as [[Manchuria]], and [[Korea]] became independent. The Philippines and [[Guam]] were returned to the United States. Burma, Malaya, and Singapore were returned to Britain and French Indo-China back to France. The Dutch East Indies was to be handed back to the Dutch but was resisted leading to the Indonesian war for independence. At the [[Yalta Conference]], [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had secretly traded the Japanese Kurils and south Sakhalin to the Soviet Union in return for Soviet entry in the war with Japan.<ref>Time Magazine, FOREIGN RELATIONS: Secret of the Kurils, Monday, 11 February 1946 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854099,00.html URL]</ref> The Soviet Union annexed the [[Kuril Islands]], provoking the [[Kuril Islands dispute]], which is ongoing, as Russia continues to occupy the islands.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Japanese were forced to relocate to the Japanese main islands. Okinawa became a main US staging point. The US covered large areas of it with military bases and continued to occupy it until 1972, years after the end of the occupation of the main islands. The bases still remain. To skirt the [[Geneva Convention]], the Allies classified many Japanese soldiers as [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] instead of POWs and used them as forced labour until 1947. The UK, France, and the Netherlands conscripted some Japanese troops to fight colonial resistances elsewhere in Asia. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] established the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]. The Allies collected reparations from Japan.\n\nTo further remove Japan as a potential future military threat, the [[Far Eastern Commission]] decided to de-industrialise Japan, with the goal of reducing Japanese standard of living to what prevailed between 1930 and 1934.<ref name=\"Frederick H 1961 pp. 531\">Frederick H.

In early 1946, the [[Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia]] were formed and permitted to supply Japanese with food and clothes. In April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should be reconstructed due to the high cost to US taxpayers of continuous emergency aid.\n\nSurvivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], known as [[hibakusha]] (\u88ab\u7206\u8005), were ostracized by Japanese society.

[[Continuation War|From 1941 until 1944]], Finland aligned itself with Nazi Germany in a failed effort to regain lost territories from the Soviets. Finland retained its independence following the war but remained subject to [[Finlandization|Soviet-imposed constraints]] in its domestic affairs.\n\n===The Baltic states===\n{{Main|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)}}\nIn 1940 the Soviet Union invaded and annexed the neutral [[Baltic states]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]. In June 1941, the Soviet governments of the Baltic states carried out [[June deportation|mass deportations]] of \"enemies of the people\"; as a result, many treated the invading Nazis as liberators when they invaded only a week later.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] promised self-determination to people deprived of it during the war. The [[British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], argued for a weaker interpretation of the Charter to permit the Soviet Union to continue to control the Baltic states.<ref>Roger S. Whitcomb, \"The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years,\" p. 18 \"Churchill suggested that the principles of the Atlantic Charter ought not be construed so as to deny Russia the frontier occupied when Germany attacked in 1941.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLq4oruub3gC&pg=PA18& Google Books]</ref> In March 1944 the U.S. accepted Churchill's view that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states.<ref>Roger S.

This continued until the mid-1950s.\n\n===The Philippines===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines}}\n\nAn estimated one million military and civilian Filipinos were killed from all causes; of these 131,028 were listed as killed in seventy-two [[war crime]] events.

The Soviet Union took over areas formerly controlled by Germany, Finland, Poland, and Japan. Poland lost the [[Kresy]] region (about half of its pre-War territory) and received [[Historical Eastern Germany|most of Germany east]] of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], including the industrial regions of [[Silesia]]. The German state of the Saar was temporarily a protectorate of France but later returned to German administration. As set forth at Potsdam, approximately 12 million people were expelled from Germany, including seven million from Germany proper, and three million from the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nDuring the war, the United States government interned approximately 110,000 [[Japanese American]]s and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] who lived along the Pacific coast of the United States in the wake of [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>National Park Service.

After the war, some internees chose to return to Japan, while most remained in North America.\n\n====Poland====\nThe Soviet Union expelled at least 2 million Poles from east of the new border approximating the [[Curzon Line]]. This estimate is uncertain as both the Polish Communist government and the Soviet government did not keep track of the number of expelled. The number of Polish citizens inhabiting Polish borderlands ([[Kresy]] region) was about 13 million before [[World War II]] broke out according to official Polish statistics. Polish citizens killed in the war that originated from the Polish borderlands territory (killed by both German Nazi regime and the Soviet regime or expelled to distant parts of [[Siberia]]) were accounted as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian casualties of war in official Soviet historiography. This fact imposes additional difficulties in making the correct estimation of the number of Polish citizens forcibly transferred after the war.<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]], a History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0231053525}}, [https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0/page/558 p.558]</ref> The border change also reversed the results of the 1919-1920 [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Former Polish cities such as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] came under control of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

European influence in the Americas, Africa, and Asia diminished significantly, and only some of them managed to hold onto their colonial outposts, such as; Great Britain, France, and the [[Netherlands]]. While the United States was considered one of two of the largest military and political powers after World War II, it did not show interest in colonizing with the exception of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].\n\nHowever, it did not hesitate to enforce its military strength; if there were protests from local governments asking for higher wages and better working conditions from US firms that have bases in Latin America, Washington would step in and destabilize the current government in order to establish one that was more compliant to its desires.\n\nThe increased industrialization in Latin America led to a need for a more educated workforce who knew how to operate the new machinery. This led to a previously unprecedented number of people attending schools for higher education when previously citizens rarely completed [[secondary school]]. Large numbers of women went on to pursue higher education for the first time, and this gave more opportunity for women in professions and employment in general outside of the home.\n\nUniversities also grew, and this led to a more progressive and left-leaning institutional setting; a larger number of people going to higher education led to a larger amount of the population being aware of and willing to challenge inequalities in society and were preoccupied with [[social justice]] and improving the [[infrastructure]] and government bureaucracy so it would serve all instead of a select privileged few.\nThese progressions managed to bring to light that while the middle class population was increasing, prosperity was absent from poor areas, both urban and rural, and this led to subsistence living or crowding into makeshift settlements on the outskirts of cities and towns.

It considered possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union and its allies in order to counter a Soviet takeover of Western Europe, the Near East and parts of Eastern Asia that they anticipated would begin around 1957. In response, the US would saturate the Soviet Union with atomic and high-explosive bombs, and then invade and occupy the country.<ref>Cave Brown, op cit, p. 169</ref> In later years, to reduce military expenditures while countering Soviet conventional strength, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would adopt a strategy of [[massive retaliation]], relying on the threat of a US nuclear strike to prevent non-nuclear incursions by the Soviet Union in Europe and elsewhere.

On 12 March 1947, to gain [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support for the aid, President Truman described the aid as promoting [[democracy]] in defence of the \"[[free world]]\", a principle that became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Lawrence S Wittner, [http://hnn.us/articles/18719.html \"How Presidents Use the Term \u2018Democracy\u2019 as a Marketing Tool\"], Retrieved October 29, 2010</ref>\n\nThe US sought to promote an economically strong and politically united Western Europe to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. This was done openly using tools such as the [[European Recovery Program]], which encouraged European economic integration. The [[International Authority for the Ruhr]], designed to keep German industry down and controlled, evolved into the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], a founding pillar of the [[European Union]]. The United States also worked covertly to promote European integration, for example using the [[American Committee on United Europe]] to funnel funds to European federalist movements. In order to ensure that Western Europe could withstand the Soviet military threat, the [[Western European Union]] was founded in 1948 and [[NATO]] in 1949. The first NATO Secretary General, [[Lord Ismay]], famously stated the organisation's goal was \"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down\". However, without the manpower and industrial output of [[West Germany]] no conventional defence of Western Europe had any hope of succeeding. To remedy this, in 1950 the US sought to promote the [[European Defence Community]], which would have included a rearmed West Germany. The attempt was dashed when the [[French Parliament]] rejected it. On 9 May 1955, West Germany was instead admitted to NATO; the immediate result was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]] five days later.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] also saw the creation of propaganda and espionage organisations such as [[Radio Free Europe]], the [[Information Research Department]], the [[Gehlen Organization]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Special Activities Division]], and the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security]].\n\n===Asia===\n[[File:Colonization 1945.png|thumb|right|300px|World map of colonization at the end of the Second World War in 1945]]\n{{Main|Decolonization of Asia|Wars of national liberation}}\nIn Asia, the surrender of Japanese forces was complicated by the split between East and West as well as by the movement toward national self-determination in European colonial territories.\n\n====China====\n{{Main|Chinese Civil War|Cross-Strait relations}}\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|upright|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the Chinese nationalist Kuomintang|alt=A Chinese man in military uniform, smiling and looking towards the left. He holds a sword in his left hand and has a medal in shape of a sun on his chest.]]\n\nAs agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the Soviet Union went to war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. The Soviet forces [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]]. This was the end of the [[Manchukuo]] puppet state and all [[Evacuation of Manchukuo|Japanese settlers were forced to leave China]]. The Soviet Union dismantled the industrial base in Manchuria built up by the Japanese in the preceding years. Manchuria also became a base for the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] Chinese forces because of the Soviet presence.\n\nAfter the war, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party (led by generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) and the Communist Chinese forces resumed their [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], which had been temporarily suspended when they fought together against Japan. The fight against the Japanese occupiers had strengthened popular support among the Chinese for the Communist [[guerrilla]] forces while it weakened the KMT, who depleted their strength fighting a conventional war. Full-scale war between the opposing forces broke out in June 1946. Despite U.S. support to the Kuomintang, Communist forces were ultimately victorious and established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) on the mainland. The KMT forces retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]] in 1949. Hostilities had largely ceased in 1950.\n\nWith the Communist victory in the civil war, the Soviet Union gave up its claim to military bases in China that it had been promised by the Western Allies during World War II. The defeat of the US-backed KMT led to a debate in the United States about who in the US government was responsible for this.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Korean War]] diverted the attention of the PRC at the same time as it bolstered US support for Chiang Kai-shek, the two main factors that prevented the PRC from invading Taiwan. Intermittent military clashes occurred between the PRC and Taiwan from 1950-1979. Taiwan unilaterally declared the civil war over in 1991, but no formal peace treaty or truce exists and the PRC officially sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that rightfully belongs to it and has expressed its opposition to [[Taiwan independence|Taiwanese independence]]. Even so, tensions between the two states has decreased over time for example with the [[Chen-Chiang summit]]s (2008-2011).\n\n[[Sino-American relations]] (between the PRC and the US) continued to be mostly hostile up until [[1972 Nixon visit to China|US president Nixon visited China]] in 1972. From this point, the relations between them have improved over time although some tension and rivalry remain even with the end of the [[Cold War]] and the PRC's distancing from the Communist ideology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Korea====\n{{Main|Division of Korea}}\n[[File:Korean war 1950-1953.gif|thumb|left|upright|Evolution of the border between the two Koreas, from the [[Conference of Yalta|Yalta]] Soviet-American 38th parallel division to the stalemate of 1953 that was officially ended in 2018 by North Korean Kim Jong-Un and South Korean Moon Jae-In]]\n\nAt the [[Yalta Conference]], the Allies agreed that an undivided post-war Korea would be placed under four-power multinational trusteeship.

It culminated in the north invading the south, start of the [[Korean War]] two years later.\n\n====Malaya====\n{{Main|Malayan Emergency}}\nLabour and civil unrest broke out in the [[British Malaya|British colony of Malaya]] in 1946. A state of emergency was declared by the colonial authorities in 1948 with the outbreak of acts of terrorism. The situation deteriorated into a full-scale anti-colonial insurgency, or Anti-British National Liberation War as the insurgents referred to it, led by the [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]].<ref>Mohamed Amin and Malcolm Caldwell (eds.), ''The Making of a Neo Colony,'' London: Spokesman Books, 1977, footnote, p. 216</ref> The Malayan Emergency would endure for the next 12 years, ending in 1960. In 1967, communist leader [[Chin Peng]] reopened hostilities, culminating in a [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|second emergency]] that lasted until 1989.\n\n====French Indochina====\n{{Main|First Indochina War}}\nEvents during World War II in the colony of [[French Indochina]] (consisting of the modern-day states of [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]) set the stage for the [[First Indochina War]] which in turn led to the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Vichy French aligned colonial authorities cooperated with the Japanese invaders. The communist-controlled [[common front]] [[Viet Minh]] (supported by the Allies) was formed among the Vietnamese in the colony in 1941 to fight for the independence of Vietnam, against both the Japanese and prewar French powers. After the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]] support for the Viet Minh was bolstered as the front launched a rebellion, sacking rice warehouses and urging the Vietnamese to refuse to pay taxes. Because the French colonial authorities started to hold secret talks with the Free French, the Japanese interned them 9 March 1945. When Japan surrendered in August, this created a power vacuum, and the Viet Minh took power in the [[August Revolution]], declaring the independent [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. However, the Allies (including the Soviet Union) all agreed that the area belonged to the French. Nationalist Chinese forces moved in from the north and British from the south (as the French were unable to do so immediately themselves) and then handed power to the French, a process completed by March 1946. Attempts to integrate the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with French rule failed and the Viet Minh launched their rebellion against the French rule starting the First Indochina War that same year (the Viet Minh organized common fronts to fight the French in Laos and Cambodia).\n\nThe war [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|ended]] in 1954 with French withdrawal and a partition of Vietnam that was intended to be temporary until elections could be held. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam held the north while [[South Vietnam]] formed into a separate republic in control of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] who was backed in his refusal to hold elections by the US. The communist party of the south eventually organized the common front [[Viet Cong|NLF]] to fight to unite south and north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thus began the [[Vietnam War]], which ended with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam [[Fall of Saigon|conquering the South]] in 1975.\n\n====Dutch East Indies====\n{{Main|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n[[File:IWM-SE-5742-tank-Surabaya-194511.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier of an Indian armoured regiment examines a light tank used by Indonesian nationalists and captured by British forces during the fighting in [[Surabaya]].]]\nJapan [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invaded]] and [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupied]] [[Indonesia]] during the war and replaced much of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial state. Although the top positions were held by Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony, using a significant portion of their Marshall Plan aid to this end.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDgBBzWQ2DAC&pg=PA403&dq=Netherlands+Marhsall+plan+aid+indonesia&sig=sQ3KNTs6jfaa_ceWBW9B_9DO-6Q |title=Nationalism and revolution in Indonesia&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-18 | isbn=978-0-87727-734-7}}</ref>  The Dutch were directly helped by UK forces who sought to re-establish the colonial dominions in Asia. The UK also kept 35,000 [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] under arms to fight the Indonesians.\n\nAlthough Dutch forces re-occupied most of Indonesia's territory, a [[Guerrillas|guerrilla]] struggle ensued, and the majority of Indonesians, and ultimately international opinion, favoured Indonesian independence. In December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian sovereignty.\n\n===Covert operations and espionage===\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|The \"[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]\" at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D.

[[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], the US and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in the [[Cold War]], so called because it never resulted in overt, declared hot war between the two powers but was instead characterized by [[espionage]], [[political subversion]] and [[proxy war]]s. [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] were rebuilt through the American [[Marshall Plan]] whereas [[Central and Eastern Europe]] fell under the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] and eventually behind an \"[[Iron Curtain]]\". Europe was divided into a US-led [[Western Bloc]] and a Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The War also saw a [[nuclear arms race]] between the two superpowers; part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \"hot\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a [[mutually assured destruction]] standoff.\n\nAs a consequence of the war, the Allies created the [[United Nations]], an organization for international cooperation and diplomacy, similar to the [[League of Nations]]. Members of the United Nations agreed to outlaw [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]] in an attempt to avoid a [[World War III|third world war]]. The devastated great powers of Western Europe formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which later evolved into the [[European Economic Community]] and ultimately into the current [[European Union]]. This effort primarily began as an attempt to avoid another war between [[Germany]] and [[France]] by economic cooperation and integration, and a common market for important natural resources.\n\nThe end of the war also increased the rate of [[decolonization]] from the great powers with independence being granted to [[India]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Indonesia]] (from the [[Netherlands]]), [[the Philippines]] (from the [[US]]) and a number of [[Arab nations]], primarily from specific rights which had been granted to great powers from [[League of Nations Mandate]]s in the [[Aftermath of World War I|post World War I-era]] but often having existed ''[[de facto]]'' well before this time.  Independence for the nations of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] came more slowly.\n\nThe aftermath of World War II also saw the rise of communist influence in Southeast Asia, with the [[People's Republic of China]], as the [[Chinese Communist Party]] emerged [[Chinese Communist Revolution|victorious]] from the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.\n\n==Immediate effects==\n[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]: Result of the war.]]\nAt the end of the war, millions of people were dead and millions more homeless, the European economy had collapsed, and much of the European industrial infrastructure had been destroyed. The [[Soviet Union]], too, had been heavily affected. In response, in 1947, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]] devised the \"European Recovery Program\", which became known as the [[Marshall Plan]]. Under the plan, during 1948\u20131952 the [[United States government]] allocated US$13 billion (US${{inflation|US|13|1947|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars) for the reconstruction of [[Western Europe]].\n\n===United Kingdom===\nBy the end of the war, the economy of the [[United Kingdom]] was one of severe privation. More than a quarter of its national wealth had been consumed. Until the introduction in 1941 of [[Lend-Lease]] aid from the US, the UK had been spending its assets to purchase American equipment including aircraft and ships\u2014over \u00a3437 million on aircraft alone. Lend-lease came just before its reserves were exhausted. Britain had placed 55% of its total labour force into war production.\n\nIn spring 1945, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] withdrew from the wartime coalition government, in an effort to oust [[Winston Churchill]], forcing a [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. Following a landslide victory, Labour held more than 60% of the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and formed a new government on 26 July 1945 under [[Clement Attlee]].\n\nBritain's war debt was described by some in the American administration as a \"millstone round the neck of the British economy\". Although there were suggestions for an international conference to tackle the issue, in August 1945 the U.S. announced unexpectedly that the Lend-Lease programme was to end immediately.\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal of American Lend-Lease support to Britain on 2 September 1945 dealt a severe blow to the plans of the new government. It was only with the completion of the [[Anglo-American loan]] by the United States to Great Britain on 15 July 1946 that some measure of economic stability was restored. However, the loan was made primarily to support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's policies for domestic welfare reforms and the [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of key industries. Although the loan was agreed on reasonable terms, its conditions included what proved to be damaging fiscal conditions for [[Pound sterling|Sterling]]. From 1946-1948, the UK introduced bread rationing, which it had never done during the war.<ref>''The Dominance of England'', Dorothy Crisp, Holborn Publishing, London 1960, pages 22-26,</ref><ref>''The World at War'', Mark Arnold-Foster, BCA London, 1974, pages 286-7,</ref><ref>''Sunday Times'' Sept 6, 2009 by Max Hastings</ref><ref>''A History of the American People'', Paul Johnson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1997, pages 647-8</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:Stalingrad aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins in Stalingrad, typical of the destruction in many Soviet cities.]]\nThe Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in the war against Germany. The Soviet population [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|decreased by about 27 million]] during the war; of these, 8.7 million were combat deaths. The 19 million non-combat deaths had a variety of causes: starvation in the [[siege of Leningrad]]; conditions in German prisons and concentration camps; mass shootings of civilians; harsh labour in German industry; famine and disease; conditions in Soviet camps; and service in German or German-controlled military units fighting the Soviet Union.<ref>Michael Ellman and S.

Others worked in labour battalions to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war.<ref>Edwin Bacon, \"Glasnost and the Gulag: New Information on Soviet Forced Labour around World War II\", ''Soviet Studies'', Vol. 44, No. 6 (1992), pp. 1069-1086.</ref><ref>Michael Ellman, \"Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments\", ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 54, No. 7 (Nov., 2002), pp. 1151-1172</ref>\n[[File:World War II Casualties2.svg|thumb|250px|[[World War II casualties]]]]\nThe economy had been devastated. Roughly a quarter of the Soviet Union's capital resources were destroyed, and industrial and agricultural output in 1945 fell far short of pre-war levels. To help rebuild the country, the Soviet government obtained limited credits from Britain and Sweden; it refused assistance offered by the United States under the Marshall Plan. Instead, the Soviet Union coerced Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe to supply machinery and raw materials. Germany and former Nazi satellites made reparations to the Soviet Union. The reconstruction programme emphasised heavy industry to the detriment of agriculture and consumer goods. By 1953, steel production was twice its 1940 level, but the production of many consumer goods and foodstuffs was lower than it had been in the late 1920s.<ref>Glenn E. Curtis, ed.

Close to one-quarter of pre-war (1937) Germany was ''de facto'' annexed by the Allies; roughly 10 million Germans were either expelled from this territory or not permitted to return to it if they had fled during the war. The remainder of Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, coordinated by the [[Allied Control Council]]. The [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]] was detached and put in economic union with France in 1947. In 1949, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was created out of the Western zones. The Soviet zone became the [[German Democratic Republic]].\n\nGermany paid [[German reparations for World War II|reparations]] to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, mainly in the form of [[Industrial plans for Germany|dismantled factories]], [[Forced labor of Germans after World War II|forced labour]], and coal.

The Allies' immediate post-war \"industrial disarmament\" plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial de-industrialization. The first industrial plan for Germany, signed in 1946, required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50% of its 1938 level. Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951. By 1950, equipment had been removed from 706 [[manufacturing plants]], and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons.<ref>Frederick H.

From 1948 onwards West Germany also became a minor beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. Volunteer organisations had initially been forbidden to send food, but in early 1946 the [[Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany]] was founded. The prohibition against sending [[CARE Package]]s to individuals in Germany was rescinded on 5 June 1946.\n\nAfter the German surrender, the [[International Red Cross]] was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting POW camps for Germans inside Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was also permitted to visit and assist prisoners in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. The Red Cross petitioned successfully for improvements to be made in the living conditions of German POWs.<ref>Staff.

At first this was undertaken in an extralegal manner by the French Resistance (called the ''\u00e9puration sauvage'', \"wild purge\"). French women who had had romantic liaisons with German soldiers were publicly humiliated and had their heads shaved. There were also a wave of summary executions estimated to have killed about 10,000 people.\n\nWhen the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] established control, the ''\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale'' (\"legal purge\") began. There were no international war crimes trials for French collaborators, who were tried in the domestic courts. Approximately 300,000 cases were investigated; 120,000 people were given various sentences including 6,763 death sentences (of which only 791 were carried out). Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later.\n\n===Italy===\nThe 1947 [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] spelled the end of the [[Italian Empire|Italian colonial empire]], along with other border revisions.

In the 1946 [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italian constitutional referendum]] the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian monarchy]] was abolished, having been associated with the deprivations of the war and the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] rule, especially in the [[Northern Italy|North]].\n\nUnlike in Germany and Japan, no [[war crimes tribunal]]s were held against Italian military and political leaders, though the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian resistance]] [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] some of them (such as [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]) at the end of the war; the [[Togliatti amnesty]], taking its name from the Communist Party secretary at the time, pardoned all wartime common and political crimes in 1946.\n\n===Austria===\nThe [[Federal State of Austria]] had been annexed by Germany in 1938 ([[Anschluss]], this union was banned by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). Austria (called [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] by the Germans) was separated from Germany and divided into four zones of occupation. With the [[Austrian State Treaty]], these zones reunited in 1955 to become the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]].\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}\n[[Image:TTPI-locatormap.png|thumb|The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in [[Micronesia]] administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986]]\n[[File:342-usaf-11034 Medical Aspects-Hiroshima.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=152|Silent film footage taken in [[Hiroshima]] in March 1946 showing survivors with severe burns and [[keloid]] scars.]]\nAfter the war, the Allies rescinded Japanese pre-war annexations such as [[Manchuria]], and [[Korea]] became independent. The Philippines and [[Guam]] were returned to the United States. Burma, Malaya, and Singapore were returned to Britain and French Indo-China back to France. The Dutch East Indies was to be handed back to the Dutch but was resisted leading to the Indonesian war for independence. At the [[Yalta Conference]], [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had secretly traded the Japanese Kurils and south Sakhalin to the Soviet Union in return for Soviet entry in the war with Japan.<ref>Time Magazine, FOREIGN RELATIONS: Secret of the Kurils, Monday, 11 February 1946 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854099,00.html URL]</ref> The Soviet Union annexed the [[Kuril Islands]], provoking the [[Kuril Islands dispute]], which is ongoing, as Russia continues to occupy the islands.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Japanese were forced to relocate to the Japanese main islands. Okinawa became a main US staging point. The US covered large areas of it with military bases and continued to occupy it until 1972, years after the end of the occupation of the main islands. The bases still remain. To skirt the [[Geneva Convention]], the Allies classified many Japanese soldiers as [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] instead of POWs and used them as forced labour until 1947. The UK, France, and the Netherlands conscripted some Japanese troops to fight colonial resistances elsewhere in Asia. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] established the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]. The Allies collected reparations from Japan.\n\nTo further remove Japan as a potential future military threat, the [[Far Eastern Commission]] decided to de-industrialise Japan, with the goal of reducing Japanese standard of living to what prevailed between 1930 and 1934.<ref name=\"Frederick H 1961 pp. 531\">Frederick H.

In early 1946, the [[Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia]] were formed and permitted to supply Japanese with food and clothes. In April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should be reconstructed due to the high cost to US taxpayers of continuous emergency aid.\n\nSurvivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], known as [[hibakusha]] (\u88ab\u7206\u8005), were ostracized by Japanese society.

[[Continuation War|From 1941 until 1944]], Finland aligned itself with Nazi Germany in a failed effort to regain lost territories from the Soviets. Finland retained its independence following the war but remained subject to [[Finlandization|Soviet-imposed constraints]] in its domestic affairs.\n\n===The Baltic states===\n{{Main|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)}}\nIn 1940 the Soviet Union invaded and annexed the neutral [[Baltic states]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]. In June 1941, the Soviet governments of the Baltic states carried out [[June deportation|mass deportations]] of \"enemies of the people\"; as a result, many treated the invading Nazis as liberators when they invaded only a week later.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] promised self-determination to people deprived of it during the war. The [[British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], argued for a weaker interpretation of the Charter to permit the Soviet Union to continue to control the Baltic states.<ref>Roger S. Whitcomb, \"The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years,\" p. 18 \"Churchill suggested that the principles of the Atlantic Charter ought not be construed so as to deny Russia the frontier occupied when Germany attacked in 1941.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLq4oruub3gC&pg=PA18& Google Books]</ref> In March 1944 the U.S. accepted Churchill's view that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states.<ref>Roger S.

This continued until the mid-1950s.\n\n===The Philippines===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines}}\n\nAn estimated one million military and civilian Filipinos were killed from all causes; of these 131,028 were listed as killed in seventy-two [[war crime]] events.

The Soviet Union took over areas formerly controlled by Germany, Finland, Poland, and Japan. Poland lost the [[Kresy]] region (about half of its pre-War territory) and received [[Historical Eastern Germany|most of Germany east]] of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], including the industrial regions of [[Silesia]]. The German state of the Saar was temporarily a protectorate of France but later returned to German administration. As set forth at Potsdam, approximately 12 million people were expelled from Germany, including seven million from Germany proper, and three million from the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nDuring the war, the United States government interned approximately 110,000 [[Japanese American]]s and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] who lived along the Pacific coast of the United States in the wake of [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>National Park Service.

After the war, some internees chose to return to Japan, while most remained in North America.\n\n====Poland====\nThe Soviet Union expelled at least 2 million Poles from east of the new border approximating the [[Curzon Line]]. This estimate is uncertain as both the Polish Communist government and the Soviet government did not keep track of the number of expelled. The number of Polish citizens inhabiting Polish borderlands ([[Kresy]] region) was about 13 million before [[World War II]] broke out according to official Polish statistics. Polish citizens killed in the war that originated from the Polish borderlands territory (killed by both German Nazi regime and the Soviet regime or expelled to distant parts of [[Siberia]]) were accounted as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian casualties of war in official Soviet historiography. This fact imposes additional difficulties in making the correct estimation of the number of Polish citizens forcibly transferred after the war.<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]], a History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0231053525}}, [https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0/page/558 p.558]</ref> The border change also reversed the results of the 1919-1920 [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Former Polish cities such as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] came under control of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

European influence in the Americas, Africa, and Asia diminished significantly, and only some of them managed to hold onto their colonial outposts, such as; Great Britain, France, and the [[Netherlands]]. While the United States was considered one of two of the largest military and political powers after World War II, it did not show interest in colonizing with the exception of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].\n\nHowever, it did not hesitate to enforce its military strength; if there were protests from local governments asking for higher wages and better working conditions from US firms that have bases in Latin America, Washington would step in and destabilize the current government in order to establish one that was more compliant to its desires.\n\nThe increased industrialization in Latin America led to a need for a more educated workforce who knew how to operate the new machinery. This led to a previously unprecedented number of people attending schools for higher education when previously citizens rarely completed [[secondary school]]. Large numbers of women went on to pursue higher education for the first time, and this gave more opportunity for women in professions and employment in general outside of the home.\n\nUniversities also grew, and this led to a more progressive and left-leaning institutional setting; a larger number of people going to higher education led to a larger amount of the population being aware of and willing to challenge inequalities in society and were preoccupied with [[social justice]] and improving the [[infrastructure]] and government bureaucracy so it would serve all instead of a select privileged few.\nThese progressions managed to bring to light that while the middle class population was increasing, prosperity was absent from poor areas, both urban and rural, and this led to subsistence living or crowding into makeshift settlements on the outskirts of cities and towns. Often, such as in the Rocinha ''[[favela]]'' near Rio de Janeiro's [[South Zone (Rio de Janeiro)|South Zone]], these poor settlements were placed directly adjacent to more wealthy residences, which emphasizes even more clearly how disproportionate these two class groups were, and still are today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 To The Present, Second Edition|last=Meade|first=Teresa|publisher=Wiley|year=2016|isbn=978-1-118-77248-5|location=|pages=223\u2013224}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war tensions==\n{{Main|Iron Curtain|Origins of the Cold War|Cold War (1947\u20131953)}}\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|Soviet expansion, change of [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Eastern Europe]]an borders and creation of the [[Communist state|Communist]] [[Eastern bloc]] after World War II]]\nThe alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate even before the war was over,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kantowicz|first=Edward R|title=Coming Apart, Coming Together|publisher=Wm.

He described Stalin as having dropped an \"[[Iron Curtain]]\" between East and West. Stalin responded by charging that co-existence between communist countries and the West was impossible.<ref>Anthony Cave Brown, ''Dropshot: The United States Plan for War with the Soviet Union in 1957,'' New York: Dial Press, 1978, p.3</ref> In mid-1948 the Soviet Union [[Berlin Blockade|imposed a blockade on the Western zone of occupation in Berlin]].\n\nDue to the rising tension in Europe and concerns over further Soviet expansion, American planners came up with a contingency plan code-named ''[[Operation Dropshot]]'' in 1949. It considered possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union and its allies in order to counter a Soviet takeover of Western Europe, the Near East and parts of Eastern Asia that they anticipated would begin around 1957. In response, the US would saturate the Soviet Union with atomic and high-explosive bombs, and then invade and occupy the country.<ref>Cave Brown, op cit, p. 169</ref> In later years, to reduce military expenditures while countering Soviet conventional strength, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would adopt a strategy of [[massive retaliation]], relying on the threat of a US nuclear strike to prevent non-nuclear incursions by the Soviet Union in Europe and elsewhere. The approach entailed a major buildup of US nuclear forces and a corresponding reduction in America's non-nuclear ground and naval strength.<ref>John Lewis Gaddis, ''Strategies of Continment'', New York: Oxford University Press, pp.127-9</ref><ref>Walter LaFeber, ''America, Russia and the Cold War 1945-1966'', New York: John Wiley, 1968, pp.123-200</ref> The Soviet Union viewed these developments as \"atomic blackmail\".<ref>Chernyak, op cit, p.359</ref>\n\nIn [[Greece]], [[Greek Civil War|civil war broke out]] in 1946 between Anglo-American-supported royalist forces and [[Democratic Army of Greece|communist-led forces]], with the royalist forces emerging as the victors.<ref>Christopher M Woodhouse, ''The Struggle for Greece 1941-1949'', London: Hart-Davis 1976, pp.3-34, 76-7</ref> The US launched a massive programme of military and economic aid to Greece and to neighbouring [[Turkey]], arising from a fear that the Soviet Union stood on the verge of breaking through the NATO defence line to the oil-rich [[Middle East]]. On 12 March 1947, to gain [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support for the aid, President Truman described the aid as promoting [[democracy]] in defence of the \"[[free world]]\", a principle that became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Lawrence S Wittner, [http://hnn.us/articles/18719.html \"How Presidents Use the Term \u2018Democracy\u2019 as a Marketing Tool\"], Retrieved October 29, 2010</ref>\n\nThe US sought to promote an economically strong and politically united Western Europe to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. This was done openly using tools such as the [[European Recovery Program]], which encouraged European economic integration. The [[International Authority for the Ruhr]], designed to keep German industry down and controlled, evolved into the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], a founding pillar of the [[European Union]]. The United States also worked covertly to promote European integration, for example using the [[American Committee on United Europe]] to funnel funds to European federalist movements. In order to ensure that Western Europe could withstand the Soviet military threat, the [[Western European Union]] was founded in 1948 and [[NATO]] in 1949. The first NATO Secretary General, [[Lord Ismay]], famously stated the organisation's goal was \"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down\". However, without the manpower and industrial output of [[West Germany]] no conventional defence of Western Europe had any hope of succeeding. To remedy this, in 1950 the US sought to promote the [[European Defence Community]], which would have included a rearmed West Germany. The attempt was dashed when the [[French Parliament]] rejected it. On 9 May 1955, West Germany was instead admitted to NATO; the immediate result was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]] five days later.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] also saw the creation of propaganda and espionage organisations such as [[Radio Free Europe]], the [[Information Research Department]], the [[Gehlen Organization]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Special Activities Division]], and the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security]].\n\n===Asia===\n[[File:Colonization 1945.png|thumb|right|300px|World map of colonization at the end of the Second World War in 1945]]\n{{Main|Decolonization of Asia|Wars of national liberation}}\nIn Asia, the surrender of Japanese forces was complicated by the split between East and West as well as by the movement toward national self-determination in European colonial territories.\n\n====China====\n{{Main|Chinese Civil War|Cross-Strait relations}}\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|upright|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the Chinese nationalist Kuomintang|alt=A Chinese man in military uniform, smiling and looking towards the left. He holds a sword in his left hand and has a medal in shape of a sun on his chest.]]\n\nAs agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the Soviet Union went to war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. The Soviet forces [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]]. This was the end of the [[Manchukuo]] puppet state and all [[Evacuation of Manchukuo|Japanese settlers were forced to leave China]]. The Soviet Union dismantled the industrial base in Manchuria built up by the Japanese in the preceding years. Manchuria also became a base for the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] Chinese forces because of the Soviet presence.\n\nAfter the war, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party (led by generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) and the Communist Chinese forces resumed their [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], which had been temporarily suspended when they fought together against Japan. The fight against the Japanese occupiers had strengthened popular support among the Chinese for the Communist [[guerrilla]] forces while it weakened the KMT, who depleted their strength fighting a conventional war. Full-scale war between the opposing forces broke out in June 1946. Despite U.S. support to the Kuomintang, Communist forces were ultimately victorious and established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) on the mainland. The KMT forces retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]] in 1949. Hostilities had largely ceased in 1950.\n\nWith the Communist victory in the civil war, the Soviet Union gave up its claim to military bases in China that it had been promised by the Western Allies during World War II. The defeat of the US-backed KMT led to a debate in the United States about who in the US government was responsible for this.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Korean War]] diverted the attention of the PRC at the same time as it bolstered US support for Chiang Kai-shek, the two main factors that prevented the PRC from invading Taiwan. Intermittent military clashes occurred between the PRC and Taiwan from 1950-1979. Taiwan unilaterally declared the civil war over in 1991, but no formal peace treaty or truce exists and the PRC officially sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that rightfully belongs to it and has expressed its opposition to [[Taiwan independence|Taiwanese independence]]. Even so, tensions between the two states has decreased over time for example with the [[Chen-Chiang summit]]s (2008-2011).\n\n[[Sino-American relations]] (between the PRC and the US) continued to be mostly hostile up until [[1972 Nixon visit to China|US president Nixon visited China]] in 1972. From this point, the relations between them have improved over time although some tension and rivalry remain even with the end of the [[Cold War]] and the PRC's distancing from the Communist ideology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Korea====\n{{Main|Division of Korea}}\n[[File:Korean war 1950-1953.gif|thumb|left|upright|Evolution of the border between the two Koreas, from the [[Conference of Yalta|Yalta]] Soviet-American 38th parallel division to the stalemate of 1953 that was officially ended in 2018 by North Korean Kim Jong-Un and South Korean Moon Jae-In]]\n\nAt the [[Yalta Conference]], the Allies agreed that an undivided post-war Korea would be placed under four-power multinational trusteeship.

It culminated in the north invading the south, start of the [[Korean War]] two years later.\n\n====Malaya====\n{{Main|Malayan Emergency}}\nLabour and civil unrest broke out in the [[British Malaya|British colony of Malaya]] in 1946. A state of emergency was declared by the colonial authorities in 1948 with the outbreak of acts of terrorism. The situation deteriorated into a full-scale anti-colonial insurgency, or Anti-British National Liberation War as the insurgents referred to it, led by the [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]].<ref>Mohamed Amin and Malcolm Caldwell (eds.), ''The Making of a Neo Colony,'' London: Spokesman Books, 1977, footnote, p. 216</ref> The Malayan Emergency would endure for the next 12 years, ending in 1960. In 1967, communist leader [[Chin Peng]] reopened hostilities, culminating in a [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|second emergency]] that lasted until 1989.\n\n====French Indochina====\n{{Main|First Indochina War}}\nEvents during World War II in the colony of [[French Indochina]] (consisting of the modern-day states of [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]) set the stage for the [[First Indochina War]] which in turn led to the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Vichy French aligned colonial authorities cooperated with the Japanese invaders. The communist-controlled [[common front]] [[Viet Minh]] (supported by the Allies) was formed among the Vietnamese in the colony in 1941 to fight for the independence of Vietnam, against both the Japanese and prewar French powers. After the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]] support for the Viet Minh was bolstered as the front launched a rebellion, sacking rice warehouses and urging the Vietnamese to refuse to pay taxes. Because the French colonial authorities started to hold secret talks with the Free French, the Japanese interned them 9 March 1945. When Japan surrendered in August, this created a power vacuum, and the Viet Minh took power in the [[August Revolution]], declaring the independent [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. However, the Allies (including the Soviet Union) all agreed that the area belonged to the French. Nationalist Chinese forces moved in from the north and British from the south (as the French were unable to do so immediately themselves) and then handed power to the French, a process completed by March 1946. Attempts to integrate the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with French rule failed and the Viet Minh launched their rebellion against the French rule starting the First Indochina War that same year (the Viet Minh organized common fronts to fight the French in Laos and Cambodia).\n\nThe war [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|ended]] in 1954 with French withdrawal and a partition of Vietnam that was intended to be temporary until elections could be held. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam held the north while [[South Vietnam]] formed into a separate republic in control of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] who was backed in his refusal to hold elections by the US. The communist party of the south eventually organized the common front [[Viet Cong|NLF]] to fight to unite south and north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thus began the [[Vietnam War]], which ended with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam [[Fall of Saigon|conquering the South]] in 1975.\n\n====Dutch East Indies====\n{{Main|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n[[File:IWM-SE-5742-tank-Surabaya-194511.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier of an Indian armoured regiment examines a light tank used by Indonesian nationalists and captured by British forces during the fighting in [[Surabaya]].]]\nJapan [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invaded]] and [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupied]] [[Indonesia]] during the war and replaced much of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial state. Although the top positions were held by Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony, using a significant portion of their Marshall Plan aid to this end.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDgBBzWQ2DAC&pg=PA403&dq=Netherlands+Marhsall+plan+aid+indonesia&sig=sQ3KNTs6jfaa_ceWBW9B_9DO-6Q |title=Nationalism and revolution in Indonesia&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-18 | isbn=978-0-87727-734-7}}</ref>  The Dutch were directly helped by UK forces who sought to re-establish the colonial dominions in Asia. The UK also kept 35,000 [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] under arms to fight the Indonesians.\n\nAlthough Dutch forces re-occupied most of Indonesia's territory, a [[Guerrillas|guerrilla]] struggle ensued, and the majority of Indonesians, and ultimately international opinion, favoured Indonesian independence. In December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian sovereignty.\n\n===Covert operations and espionage===\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|The \"[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]\" at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D.

It is the snail-shaped shell containing several nerve endings that makes hearing possible.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ototoxicity|work=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|title=ototoxicity}}</ref>\nOtotoxicity typically results when the inner ear is poisoned by medication that damages the cochlea, vestibule, semi-circular canals, or the auditory/ vestibulocochlear nerve. The damaged structure then produces the symptoms the patient presents with. Ototoxicity in the cochlea may cause hearing loss of the high-frequency pitch ranges or complete deafness, or losses at points between.<ref name=Mudd>{{cite web|last=Mudd|first=Pamela | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ototoxicity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857679-overview|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=30 Nov 2011}}</ref>  It may present with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms, or asymmetrically, with one ear developing the condition after the other or not at all.<ref name=Mudd/> The time frames for progress of the disease vary greatly and symptoms of hearing loss may be temporary or permanent.<ref name=Farlex/>\n\nThe [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] and [[semi-circular canal]] are inner-ear components that comprise the vestibular system. Together they detect all directions of head movement. Two types of [[otolith organs]] are housed in the vestibule: the [[saccule]], which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration, and the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]], which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration. The otolith organs together sense the head's position with respect to gravity when the body is static; then the head's movement when it tilts; and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head. The saccule and utricle detect different motions, which information the brain receives and integrates to determine where the head is and how and where it is moving.\n\nThe semi-circular canals are three bony structures filled with fluid. As with the vestibule, the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement. Each canal is oriented at right angles to the others, enabling detection of movement in any plane. The posterior canal detects rolling motion, or motion about the X axis; the anterior canal detects pitch, or motion about the Y axis; the horizontal canal detects yaw motion, or motion about the Z axis. \nWhen a medication is toxic in the vestibule or the semi-circular canals, the patient senses loss of balance or orientation rather than losses in hearing. Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo, difficulties walking in low light and darkness, disequilibrium, oscillopsia among others.<ref name=Mudd/> Each of these problems is related to balance and the mind is confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion. Both the vestibule and semi-circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement; when these are poisoned, they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain.\n\nWhen the vestibule and/or semi-circular canals are affected by ototoxicity, the eye can also be affected. [[Nystagmus]] and [[oscillopsia]] are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems. These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images. The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving. This results in that dizziness and \"woozy\" feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo.<ref name=Mudd/>\n\n[[Cranial nerve VIII]] is the least affected component of the ear when ototoxicity arises, but if the nerve is affected, the damage is most often permanent. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficulty walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues.\n\n==Ototoxic agents==\n\n===Antibiotics===\nAntibiotics in the [[aminoglycoside]] class, such as [[gentamicin]] and [[tobramycin]], may produce cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid16549744\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobie RA, Black FO, Pezsnecker SC, Stallings VL | title = Hearing loss in patients with vestibulotoxic reactions to gentamicin therapy | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 132 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u20137 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16549744 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.132.3.253 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It may result from antibiotic binding to [[NMDA receptor]]s in the [[cochlea]] and damaging [[neuron]]s through [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\"pmid8946832\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Basile AS, Huang JM, Xie C, Webster D, Berlin C, Skolnick P | title = N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists limit aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1338\u201343 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8946832 | doi = 10.1038/nm1296-1338 }}</ref> Aminoglycoside-induced production of [[reactive oxygen species]] may also injure cells of the [[cochlea]].<ref name=\"pmid12053140\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WJ, Sha SH, Schacht J | title = Recent advances in understanding aminoglycoside ototoxicity and its prevention | journal = Audiology and Neuro-Otology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 171\u20134 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12053140 | doi = 10.1159/000058305 }}</ref> Once-daily dosing<ref name=\"pmid8722531\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Munckhof WJ, Grayson ML, Turnidge JD | title = A meta-analysis of studies on the safety and efficacy of aminoglycosides given either once daily or as divided doses | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 645\u201363 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8722531 | doi = 10.1093/jac/37.4.645 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and co-administration of [[N-acetylcysteine|''N''-acetylcysteine]]<ref name=\"pmid17653228\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepel M | title = N-Acetylcysteine in the prevention of ototoxicity | journal = Kidney International | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 231\u20132 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17653228 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ki.5002299 }}</ref> may protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.

The damaged structure then produces the symptoms the patient presents with. Ototoxicity in the cochlea may cause hearing loss of the high-frequency pitch ranges or complete deafness, or losses at points between.<ref name=Mudd>{{cite web|last=Mudd|first=Pamela | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ototoxicity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857679-overview|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=30 Nov 2011}}</ref>  It may present with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms, or asymmetrically, with one ear developing the condition after the other or not at all.<ref name=Mudd/> The time frames for progress of the disease vary greatly and symptoms of hearing loss may be temporary or permanent.<ref name=Farlex/>\n\nThe [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] and [[semi-circular canal]] are inner-ear components that comprise the vestibular system. Together they detect all directions of head movement. Two types of [[otolith organs]] are housed in the vestibule: the [[saccule]], which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration, and the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]], which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration. The otolith organs together sense the head's position with respect to gravity when the body is static; then the head's movement when it tilts; and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head. The saccule and utricle detect different motions, which information the brain receives and integrates to determine where the head is and how and where it is moving.\n\nThe semi-circular canals are three bony structures filled with fluid. As with the vestibule, the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement. Each canal is oriented at right angles to the others, enabling detection of movement in any plane. The posterior canal detects rolling motion, or motion about the X axis; the anterior canal detects pitch, or motion about the Y axis; the horizontal canal detects yaw motion, or motion about the Z axis. \nWhen a medication is toxic in the vestibule or the semi-circular canals, the patient senses loss of balance or orientation rather than losses in hearing. Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo, difficulties walking in low light and darkness, disequilibrium, oscillopsia among others.<ref name=Mudd/> Each of these problems is related to balance and the mind is confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion. Both the vestibule and semi-circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement; when these are poisoned, they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain.\n\nWhen the vestibule and/or semi-circular canals are affected by ototoxicity, the eye can also be affected. [[Nystagmus]] and [[oscillopsia]] are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems. These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images. The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving. This results in that dizziness and \"woozy\" feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo.<ref name=Mudd/>\n\n[[Cranial nerve VIII]] is the least affected component of the ear when ototoxicity arises, but if the nerve is affected, the damage is most often permanent. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficulty walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues.\n\n==Ototoxic agents==\n\n===Antibiotics===\nAntibiotics in the [[aminoglycoside]] class, such as [[gentamicin]] and [[tobramycin]], may produce cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid16549744\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobie RA, Black FO, Pezsnecker SC, Stallings VL | title = Hearing loss in patients with vestibulotoxic reactions to gentamicin therapy | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 132 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u20137 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16549744 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.132.3.253 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It may result from antibiotic binding to [[NMDA receptor]]s in the [[cochlea]] and damaging [[neuron]]s through [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\"pmid8946832\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Basile AS, Huang JM, Xie C, Webster D, Berlin C, Skolnick P | title = N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists limit aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1338\u201343 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8946832 | doi = 10.1038/nm1296-1338 }}</ref> Aminoglycoside-induced production of [[reactive oxygen species]] may also injure cells of the [[cochlea]].<ref name=\"pmid12053140\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WJ, Sha SH, Schacht J | title = Recent advances in understanding aminoglycoside ototoxicity and its prevention | journal = Audiology and Neuro-Otology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 171\u20134 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12053140 | doi = 10.1159/000058305 }}</ref> Once-daily dosing<ref name=\"pmid8722531\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Munckhof WJ, Grayson ML, Turnidge JD | title = A meta-analysis of studies on the safety and efficacy of aminoglycosides given either once daily or as divided doses | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 645\u201363 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8722531 | doi = 10.1093/jac/37.4.645 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and co-administration of [[N-acetylcysteine|''N''-acetylcysteine]]<ref name=\"pmid17653228\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepel M | title = N-Acetylcysteine in the prevention of ototoxicity | journal = Kidney International | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 231\u20132 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17653228 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ki.5002299 }}</ref> may protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], who had played with Frank Beard in American Blues, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].
