The league was resumed in 2009 with five federations participating, as well as the national women's [[New Zealand women's national under-19 football team|under-19 team]] development squad. The league currently contains seven teams, one run by each federation.\n\nThe league was run as a pure [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] league format in 2002 and 2003. From 2004 to 2007 there were play-offs, with the second- and third-placed teams after the round-robin competing in a one legged semi-final at the second-placed team's home ground. The winner of that and the first-place team then played the Grand Final to decide the champion.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, the league was split into two divisions, a Northern and a Southern Conference, each of four teams that play each other twice. After the season there are semi-finals, with the winner of each conference playing the runners-up of the other. The winners of those play the Grand Final. In 2013 the league reverted to the system used from 2004 to 2008.\n\nFrom 2010, the league has run in the summer (previous seasons were held over winter). From 2010 to 2014, the league became age-restricted as a national women's youth league, with players of under-20 age only participating. The restrictions were removed in 2015, and since then the league has run as an unrestricted full women's league. \n\nNZ Football is looking to move the National Women's League to club-based competition like the Men's competition by 2020. It also hopes to expand the number of games each federation plays in 2018 to a two-round system where each team plays home and away once against every other team in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzfootball.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/National-Competitions-Review-The-Way-Forward-March-2017V9.pdf |title=National Competitions Review |publisher=NZ Football |date=2017-04-09 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Participants==\n===Current===\n* [[Northern Lights (football team)|Northern Lights]] (as \"North Harbour\" until 2007 and then Northern Football until 2010) (2002\u20132007, 2010\u2013\n* [[Auckland Football Federation|Auckland Football]] (2002\u2013\n* [[WaiBOP United]] (2002\u2013\n* [[Central Football]] (as \"Central Soccer\" until 2007) (2002\u20132007, 2010\u2013\n* [[Capital Football (New Zealand)|Capital Football]] (as \"Capital Soccer\" until 2006) (2002\u2013\n* [[Canterbury United Pride]] (as \"Mainland Soccer\" (2002\u20132005), \"Mainland Pride\" (2006\u20132007, 2010\u2013), and \"Mainland Football\" (2009)) (2002\u2013\n* [[Southern United FC|Southern United]] (as \"Soccersouth\" until 2007) (2002\u2013\n\n===Former===\n*Auckland Under-20 Development (2010\u20132011)\n*New Zealand Football Development (2005\u20132006, 2009, 2014\u20132016)\n::This comprised the [[New Zealand women's national under-19 football team|national under-19 team]] (2005), [[New Zealand women's national under-18 football team|national under-18 team]] (2006, 2014\u20132016), and [[New Zealand women's national under-17 football team|national under-17 team]] (2009).

Later in 14th to 15th century, the former kingdom was recognised as one of [[Majapahit]]'s 12 provinces.\n\n==Fall of Medang==\nAirlangga was the son of queen [[Mahendradatta]] (a princess of the [[Isyana Dynasty]], [[Medang]], the sister of [[Dharmawangsa]]) and [[Udayana Warmadewa]] (a king of the [[Warmadewa Dynasty]], [[Bali]]). Airlangga was born and grew up in Bali, he spend his youth in Watugaluh Palace, Medang, under the patronage of his uncle, king [[Dharmawangsa]]. Airlangga was betrothed to his cousin, one of Dharmawangsa's daughter, thus arranged marriage was in place. At that time, Medang had become a powerful kingdom, allied or probably subjugated Bali, and had established a colony in [[West Kalimantan]]. Dharmawangsa aspired to ascend Medang as regional power by challenging [[Srivijaya]] Empire domination. He launched naval invasion against Srivijaya and unsuccessfully tried to capture Palembang. Srivijaya resiliently succeed on repelling Javanese Medang invaders.\n\nThe Calcutta Stone inscription (dated from 1041), describes a terrible calamity which befell the East Javanese kingdom of Isyana dynasty in the early years of the 11th century. In 1006, a rebellion incited by a vassal king Wurawari from Lwaram resulted in the destruction of the capital of Watugaluh. The reigning king, Dharmawangsa, successor to Sri Makutawangsawardhana, was murdered along with his entire family and many of his subjects. Only the young Airlangga, who was aged about 16 at the time, managed to escape unharmed.<ref name=\"East Java.com\">[http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/html/airlangga.html East Java.com]</ref> According to tradition the calamity, dubbed as ''Pralaya'' (the death) of Medang, took place during Airlangga's wedding ceremony in Dharmawangsa palace.\n\nToday historians strongly suggested that the invasion was actually a Srivijayan retaliation against Medang for the attacks upon the empire. Wurawari was probably an ally of Srivijaya in Java that managed to sack and burn Watugaluh Palace. Airlangga, accompanied by his guard Narottama, escaped into the jungle and retreated as a hermit in Vanagiri (today [[Wonogiri]], Central Java).\n\n==Formation==\n[[Image:Airlangga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King Airlangga depicted as [[Vishnu]] mounting [[Garuda]], found in Belahan temple.]]\nIn 1019, after several years in self-imposed exile in Vanagiri hermitage, Airlangga rallied supports from officials and regents that are loyal to the former Isyana dynasty and began to unite the areas that had formerly been ruled by Medang kingdom, which had disintegrated after Dharmawangsa's death.

In 1025, Airlangga increased the power and influence of Kahuripan as the Srivijaya Empire began to decline. Airlangga was known for his religious tolerance, and was a patron of both the Hindu and Buddhist religions.\n\n[[File:KITLV 87758 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculptures at Gaprang in Kediri - Before 1900.tif|thumb|Stone sculptures at [[Gaprang]] in Kediri]]\nIn 1035 Airlangga constructed a Buddhist monastery named Srivijayasrama dedicated for his queen consort Dharmaprasadottungadevi. The monastery bearing the name of Srivijaya suggests that his queen consort was probably a Srivijayan princess, a close relative, probably daughter, of the Srivijayan king Sangramavijayattungavarman.<ref name=indianised/>{{rp|146}} She had taken refuge in East Java after her father was taken prisoner and her kingdom was raided through series of  raids of the Indian Emperors [[Rajendra Chola I]] and [[Virarajendra Chola]] of the [[Chola dynasty]].

The north coast of Java, particularly the port of Hujung Galuh (modern [[Surabaya]]) and Kambang Putih (modern [[Tuban]]), for the first time became important centres of trade.\n\nAlthough there are few surviving archaeological remains dating from his time, Airlangga is known to have been a keen patron of the arts, notably literature. In 1035, the court poet Mpu Kanwa composed the Arjuna Wiwaha text, which was adapted from the [[Mahabharata]] epic. This text told the story of [[Arjuna]], an incarnation of [[Indra]], but was also an allegory for Airlangga's own life.

He embarked on grand irrigation project by constructing the Wringin Sapta dam (located in today Jombang regency). By built a dam on Brantas river, he provides irrigation to surrounding paddy fields and maintaining hydraulic system in the area.<ref name=\"Sejarah\"/>\n\n==Partition==\n[[File:MET DT5213.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nganjuk Regency|Nganjuk]] bronze figures depicting Boddhisattvas, late 10th to mid 11th century originated from the Kahuripan kingdom period in East Java.]]\nTowards the end of his life, Airlangga was faced with the problem of succession. His heiress, the crown princess Sanggramawijaya, chose to become a Bhikkuni Buddhist hermit rather than succeed Airlangga. Sangramawijaya is the daughter of the queen consort. The story of a crown princess whom renounce the throne to become a hermit is linked with the popular legend of [[Dewi Kilisuci]] that resides in the Selomangleng Cave beneath Mount Klothok, 5 kilometres to the west of the city of [[Kediri (city)|Kediri]]. In 1045, Airlangga divided Kahuripan into two kingdoms which were inherited by his two sons; [[Janggala]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. Airlangga himself abdicated the throne in 1045, returned to the hermit life by assuming a new name as Resi Gentayu, bestowed by Mpu Bharada, a famous hermit. A local legend, mixed with fantastic fiction, mentioned about the partition of the kingdom. It was said that Mpu Bharada was the one that conduct the partition; with his extraordinary skill he flew and pouring water from a jar that the water traces magically transformed into a river marking the boundary of the two new kingdoms. Accidentally he stuck on a kamal (tamarind) tree, feeling upset he cursed the kamal tree to be forever short, thus become the name of the village where this event took place; ''kamal pandak'' (\"the short tamarind tree\").\n\nAirlanga died in 1049, and his ashes were buried in Belahan tirtha (sacred bathing pool), on eastern slopes of Mount Penanggungan, where in one of waterspout statues he was portrayed as Vishnu riding Garuda,<ref name=indianised/>{{rp|146}} flanked by statues of two goddesses; [[Dewi Sri|Shri]] and [[Lakshmi]] portrayed the two queen consorts of Airlangga.\n\nAfter the death of Airlangga, a civil war broke out between Janggala and Panjalu that continued until 1052. In that year, King Mapanji Alanjung Ahyes of Panjalu succeeded in conquering Janggala. However, in 1059, another king named Samarotsaha ascended the throne of Janggala; he was the son-in-law of Airlangga.\n\n==Kahuripan during Majapahit period==\nThe name of Kahuripan kingdom reappears during [[Majapahit]] period c. 14th to 15th century. It was held as one of Majapahit 12 provinces and recognised as one of the most important Majapahit territories together with Daha (Kadiri). Both areas flanking [[Trowulan]], the Majapahit capital; Daha in the west and Kahuripan in the east. Kahuripan region was especially important for Majapahit because this area around estuarine of Brantas river is the coastal region where Hujung Galuh town, one of the main Majapahit's port, was located.\n\n''[[Pararaton]]'' recorded several Majapahit state officials as the regent of Kahuripan, titled ''Bhatara i Kahuripan'' or ''[[Bhre]] Kahuripan''. The first is [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]] the daughter of [[Raden Wijaya]]. After 1319, she was assisted by [[Gajah Mada]] promoted as ''patih'' (prime minister) of Kahuripan, as the reward of his service cracking down Ra Kuti rebellion.\n\n[[Hayam Wuruk]], during his early youthful years as yuvaraja (crown prince), also held the title as the king of Kahuripan titled ''Jiwanarajyapratistha''. After he ascends to the Majapahit throne, the title of Bhre Kahuripan was returned to his mother Tribhuwana Tunggadewi.\n\nAfter the death of Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, the title as Kahuripan regent was held by her grand daughter Surawardhani, later inherited by her son Ratnapangkaja. After Ratnapangkaja the title was held by Queen [[Suhita]]'s nephew, Rajasawardhana. When Rajasawardhana ascend the throne of Majapahit, the title of Bhre Kahuripan was inherited to his son Samarawijaya.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:Medieval Hindu kingdoms]]\n[[Category:History of Java]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Kahuripan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|11th century Javanese kingdom}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Kahuripan\n|common_name            = Kuripan\n|religion               = [[Kejawen]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]]\n|p1                     = Medang Kingdom\n|s1                     = Janggala\n|s2                     = Kediri (historical kingdom)\n|year_start             = 1019\n|year_end               = 1045\n|date_start             = \n|date_end               = \n|event_start            = [[Airlangga]] reunite the former kingdom of Medang after fell under King Wurawari attack from Lwaram\n|event_end              = [[Airlangga]] divided his kingdom into Janggala and Panjalu (Kediri)\n|image_flag             = \n|image_coat             = \n|symbol_type            = \n|image_map              = Kediri Kingdom.svg\n|image_map_caption      = Kehuripan was the predecessor of Janggala and Panjalu (Kadiri)\n|capital                = Kahuripan (estuarine of Brantas river somewhere around modern [[Surabaya]] and [[Pasuruan]])\n|common_languages       = [[Old Javanese]], [[Sanskrit]]\n|government_type        = Monarchy\n|title_leader           = Raja\n|leader1                = [[Airlangga]]\n|year_leader1           = 1019\u20131045\n|currency               = Native gold and silver coins\n|footnotes              = \n}}\n{{History of Indonesia}}\n'''Kahuripan''' (also spelt '''Kuripan''') later [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] was an 11th-century [[Java]]nese [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] kingdom with its capital located around the estuarine of [[Brantas River]] valley in [[East Java]].

The tale of Airlangga's life was illustrated in the [[Belahan]] [[Temple]] on the flanks of Mount Penanggungan, where he was portrayed in stone as Vishnu on Garuda.<ref name=\"East Java.com\"/>\n\nIn 1037 the capital was moved from Watan Mas to Kahuripan,<ref name=indianised/>{{rp|145}} the king also reported to bestows titles for his loyal followers, such as Narottama promoted as Rakryan Kanuruhan (prime minister) and Niti as Rakryan Kuningan.<ref name=\"Sejarah\">{{cite book\n |url        =https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBsbH0AX6gC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=Wringin+Sapta+dam&source=bl&ots=3AaKYPzpkD&sig=K3sjDGy_ztXdHInsmrXznnlV7nY&hl=id&sa=X&ei=7mxQUdLSJ8OIrQecpoHwCg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Wringin%20Sapta%20dam&f=false\n |title      =Sejarah: Untuk kelas 2 SMA\n |author     =M.

He embarked on grand irrigation project by constructing the Wringin Sapta dam (located in today Jombang regency). By built a dam on Brantas river, he provides irrigation to surrounding paddy fields and maintaining hydraulic system in the area.<ref name=\"Sejarah\"/>\n\n==Partition==\n[[File:MET DT5213.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nganjuk Regency|Nganjuk]] bronze figures depicting Boddhisattvas, late 10th to early 11th century originated from the Kahuripan kingdom period in East Java.]]\nTowards the end of his life, Airlangga was faced with the problem of succession. His heiress, the crown princess Sanggramawijaya, chose to become a Bhikkuni Buddhist hermit rather than succeed Airlangga. Sangramawijaya is the daughter of the queen consort. The story of a crown princess whom renounce the throne to become a hermit is linked with the popular legend of [[Dewi Kilisuci]] that resides in the Selomangleng Cave beneath Mount Klothok, 5 kilometres to the west of the city of [[Kediri (city)|Kediri]]. In 1045, Airlangga divided Kahuripan into two kingdoms which were inherited by his two sons; [[Janggala]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. Airlangga himself abdicated the throne in 1045, returned to the hermit life by assuming a new name as Resi Gentayu, bestowed by Mpu Bharada, a famous hermit. A local legend, mixed with fantastic fiction, mentioned about the partition of the kingdom. It was said that Mpu Bharada was the one that conduct the partition; with his extraordinary skill he flew and pouring water from a jar that the water traces magically transformed into a river marking the boundary of the two new kingdoms. Accidentally he stuck on a kamal (tamarind) tree, feeling upset he cursed the kamal tree to be forever short, thus become the name of the village where this event took place; ''kamal pandak'' (\"the short tamarind tree\").\n\nAirlanga died in 1049, and his ashes were buried in Belahan tirtha (sacred bathing pool), on eastern slopes of Mount Penanggungan, where in one of waterspout statues he was portrayed as Vishnu riding Garuda,<ref name=indianised/>{{rp|146}} flanked by statues of two goddesses; [[Dewi Sri|Shri]] and [[Lakshmi]] portrayed the two queen consorts of Airlangga.\n\nAfter the death of Airlangga, a civil war broke out between Janggala and Panjalu that continued until 1052. In that year, King Mapanji Alanjung Ahyes of Panjalu succeeded in conquering Janggala. However, in 1059, another king named Samarotsaha ascended the throne of Janggala; he was the son-in-law of Airlangga.\n\n==Kahuripan during Majapahit period==\nThe name of Kahuripan kingdom reappears during [[Majapahit]] period c. 14th to 15th century. It was held as one of Majapahit 12 provinces and recognised as one of the most important Majapahit territories together with Daha (Kadiri). Both areas flanking [[Trowulan]], the Majapahit capital; Daha in the west and Kahuripan in the east. Kahuripan region was especially important for Majapahit because this area around estuarine of Brantas river is the coastal region where Hujung Galuh town, one of the main Majapahit's port, was located.\n\n''[[Pararaton]]'' recorded several Majapahit state officials as the regent of Kahuripan, titled ''Bhatara i Kahuripan'' or ''[[Bhre]] Kahuripan''. The first is [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]] the daughter of [[Raden Wijaya]]. After 1319, she was assisted by [[Gajah Mada]] promoted as ''patih'' (prime minister) of Kahuripan, as the reward of his service cracking down Ra Kuti rebellion.\n\n[[Hayam Wuruk]], during his early youthful years as yuvaraja (crown prince), also held the title as the king of Kahuripan titled ''Jiwanarajyapratistha''. After he ascends to the Majapahit throne, the title of Bhre Kahuripan was returned to his mother Tribhuwana Tunggadewi.\n\nAfter the death of Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, the title as Kahuripan regent was held by her grand daughter Surawardhani, later inherited by her son Ratnapangkaja. After Ratnapangkaja the title was held by Queen [[Suhita]]'s nephew, Rajasawardhana. When Rajasawardhana ascend the throne of Majapahit, the title of Bhre Kahuripan was inherited to his son Samarawijaya.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:Medieval Hindu kingdoms]]\n[[Category:History of Java]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Kahuripan]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePartition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahuripan"}
