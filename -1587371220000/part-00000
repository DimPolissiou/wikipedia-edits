The congestion at the port led experts to realize the need for a port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority under the supervision of the governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.<ref>Thomas C. Cochran, \"The City's Business,\" in \"Allan Nevins and John A. Krout, eds.

The initial tunnel crossings were completed privately by the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]] in 1908 and 1909 (\"Hudson Tubes\"), followed by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1910 (\"[[North River Tunnels]]\"). Under an independent agency, the [[Holland Tunnel]] was opened in 1927, with some planning and construction pre-dating the Port Authority. With the rise in [[automobile]] traffic, there was demand for more [[Hudson River]] crossings. Using its ability to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and collect revenue, the Port Authority has built and managed major infrastructure projects. Early projects included bridges across the [[Arthur Kill]], which separates [[Staten Island]] from New Jersey.<ref name=history/> The [[Goethals Bridge]], named after chief engineer of the [[Panama Canal]] Commission General [[George Washington Goethals]], connected [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] and [[Howland Hook, Staten Island]].

In the post-[[World War II]] period, the Port Authority expanded its operations to include airports, and [[Marine Air Terminal|marine terminals]], with projects including [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] and [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]]s. Meanwhile, the city-owned La Guardia Field was nearing capacity in 1939, and needed expensive upgrades and expansion.

Although many questioned the Port Authority's entry into the real estate market, Tobin saw the project as a way to enhance the agency's power and prestige, and agreed to the project. The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center, hiring the architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]] and engineer [[Leslie Robertson]].\n\nYamasaki ultimately settled on the idea of twin towers. To meet the Port Authority's requirement to build {{convert|10|e6sqft|m2}} of office space, the towers would each be 110 stories tall. The size of the project raised ire from the owner of the [[Empire State Building]], which would lose its title of tallest building in the world.<ref name=\"Gillespie-chap1\"/> Other critics objected to the idea of this much \"subsidized\" office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector. Others questioned the cost of the project, which in 1966 had risen to $575{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Gillespie-chap1\"/> Final negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made that the Port Authority would make annual payments in lieu of taxes, for the 40% of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. The remaining space was to be occupied by state and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government agencies. In 1962, the Port Authority signed the [[United States Customs Service]] as a tenant, and in 1964 they inked a deal with the [[New York State|State of New York]] to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn August 1968, construction on the World Trade Center's north tower started, with construction on the south tower beginning in January 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/newyork/timeline/index.html |title=Timeline: World Trade Center chronology |publisher=PBS \u2013 American Experience |accessdate=September 30, 2006}}</ref> When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed, the total cost to the Port Authority had reached $900{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Cudahy\">{{Cudahy-Hudson|page=56}}</ref> The buildings were dedicated on April 4, 1973, with Tobin, who had retired the year before, absent from the ceremonies.<ref name=\"Darton-chap6\">{{cite book |last=Darton |first=Eric |title=Divided We Stand: A Biography of New York's World Trade Center |url=https://archive.org/details/dividedwestand00eric |url-access=registration |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Books |chapter=Chapter 6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the Port Authority sold rights to the World Trade Center name for $10 to an organization run by an outgoing executive, [[Guy F.

The congestion at the port led experts to realize the need for a port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority under the supervision of the governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.<ref>Thomas C. Cochran, \"The City's Business,\" in \"Allan Nevins and John A. Krout, eds.

Under an independent agency, the [[Holland Tunnel]] was opened in 1927, with some planning and construction pre-dating the Port Authority. With the rise in [[automobile]] traffic, there was demand for more [[Hudson River]] crossings.

Meanwhile, the city-owned La Guardia Field was nearing capacity in 1939, and needed expensive upgrades and expansion. At the time, airports were operated as [[loss leader]]s, and the city was having difficulties maintaining the status quo, losing money and unable to undertake needed expansions.<ref name=\"Lander\">{{cite news |url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/landuse/aug.02.shtml |title=Land Use |author=Lander, Brad |newspaper=Gotham Gazette |date=August 2002 |accessdate=October 3, 2006}}</ref> The city was looking to hand the airports over to a [[Public benefit corporation|public authority]], possibly to [[Robert Moses]]' [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]. After long negotiations with the City of New York, a 50-year lease, commencing on May 31, 1947, went to the Port Authority of New York to rehabilitate, develop, and operate [[La Guardia Airport]] (La Guardia Field), [[John F.

Although many questioned the Port Authority's entry into the real estate market, Tobin saw the project as a way to enhance the agency's power and prestige, and agreed to the project. The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center, hiring the architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]] and engineer [[Leslie Robertson]].\n\nYamasaki ultimately settled on the idea of twin towers. To meet the Port Authority's requirement to build {{convert|10|e6sqft|m2}} of office space, the towers would each be 110 stories tall. The size of the project raised ire from the owner of the [[Empire State Building]], which would lose its title of tallest building in the world.<ref name=\"Gillespie-chap1\"/> Other critics objected to the idea of this much \"subsidized\" office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector. Others questioned the cost of the project, which in 1966 had risen to $575{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Gillespie-chap1\"/> Final negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made that the Port Authority would make annual payments in lieu of taxes, for the 40% of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. The remaining space was to be occupied by state and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government agencies. In 1962, the Port Authority signed the [[United States Customs Service]] as a tenant, and in 1964 they inked a deal with the [[New York State|State of New York]] to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn August 1968, construction on the World Trade Center's north tower started, with construction on the south tower beginning in January 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/newyork/timeline/index.html |title=Timeline: World Trade Center chronology |publisher=PBS \u2013 American Experience |accessdate=September 30, 2006}}</ref> When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed, the total cost to the Port Authority had reached $900{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Cudahy\">{{Cudahy-Hudson|page=56}}</ref> The buildings were dedicated on April 4, 1973, with Tobin, who had retired the year before, absent from the ceremonies.<ref name=\"Darton-chap6\">{{cite book |last=Darton |first=Eric |title=Divided We Stand: A Biography of New York's World Trade Center |url=https://archive.org/details/dividedwestand00eric |url-access=registration |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Books |chapter=Chapter 6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the Port Authority sold rights to the World Trade Center name for $10 to an organization run by an outgoing executive, [[Guy F.

Dedicated toll lanes for one of the Fort Lee entrances (used by local traffic from Fort Lee and surrounding communities) to the upper level on the [[George Washington Bridge]], which connects to [[Manhattan]], were reduced from three to one from September 9\u201313, 2013. The toll lane closures caused massive Fort Lee traffic back-ups, which affected public safety due to extensive delays by police and emergency service providers and disrupted schools due to the delayed arrivals of students and teachers. Two Port Authority officials (who were appointed by Christie and would later resign) claimed that reallocating two of the toll lanes from the local Fort Lee entrance to the [[Highway#United States|major highways]] was due to a [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic study]] evaluating \"traffic safety patterns\" at the bridge, but the Executive Director of the Port Authority was unaware of a traffic study.<ref>{{cite news | first = Ted | last = Mann | first2=Heather | last2=Haddon | title = Bridge Jam's Cause a Mystery | date = September 17, 2013 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridge-jams-cause-a-mystery-1379471038 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = January 10, 2014 | url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Baxter |first=Christopher |title=UPDATED: Timeline of Port Authority's George Washington Bridge controversy |url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/timeline_of_the_port_authoritys_george_washington_bridge_lane_closure_controversy.html |work=The Star-Ledger |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140109215119/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/timeline_of_the_port_authoritys_george_washington_bridge_lane_closure_controversy.html |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bridge-somewhere |title=A Bridge to Somewhere |last1=Benen |first1=Steve |date=December 16, 2013 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2014|03}}, the repercussions and controversy surrounding these actions continue to be under investigation by the Port Authority, federal prosecutors, and a New Jersey legislature committee.

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.

It is a part of the [[City of Gosnells]] [[local government areas of Western Australia|local government area]]. The [[Canning River]] runs through the northern side of the suburb. Since the 1950s the suburb has developed in approximately five stages; north-east Thornlie (1950s-60s), south Thornlie (1970s-80s), Crestwood (1970s), Castle Glen (1980s) and Forest Lakes (1980s to present).\n\n== History ==\n[[Peter P\u00e9gus|Captain Peter P\u00e9gus]] was the original settler of the area now known as Thornlie, which he had called \"Coleraine\" when granted the land in 1829.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = McDonald\n | first = Gil\n |author2=Bill Cooper\n  | title = The Gosnells Story\n |date=April 1988\n | edition = 1st\n | publisher = City of Gosnells\n | isbn = 0-7316-2737-7\n | pages = 9\u201312\n | chapter = Survey and Settlement\n }}</ref>\n[[Aboriginal history of Western Australia|Prior to this]] the area would have been used by the indigenous [[Noongar]] population.

O'Sullivan and by June 1956 the Gosnells Roads Board had provided approval for the development of the area.<ref Name=p229/> By March 1957, forty houses had been completed and by May 1958 there were 100 occupied homes.<ref Name=p229/> Thornlie thus as a residential suburb was established in the late 1950s as a housing estate aimed mainly at middle-income earners and inner city dwellers.<ref Name=p229/>\n\nThe first homes in the area included a section of  residences constructed in the 1950s and early 1960s which lie to the north of the intersection of Thornlie Avenue and Spencer Road, and residences lying to the south of Thornlie Avenue between Spencer Road and the [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning River]] which were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. During this time Thornlie's development was aimed at inner city dwellers who might want to live in a more spacious semi-urban-rural setting. It is one reason why Thornlie has typically large {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|order=flip|abbr=on}} blocks and is often described as one of Perth's leafy suburbs.\n\nThe more upmarket [[#Crestwood Estate|Crestwood Estate]], which was an experiment in providing fully integrated facilities and services to home-owners, was established from the early 1970s in the southern part of Thornlie, an experiment which was rarely replicated in later Perth subdivisions.  From the 1980s the newer Castle Glen and Forest Lakes housing estates, which were at that time to some extent in competition with one another for land purchasers, were established in the remaining land in the western and south-western portions of Thornlie.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. The focus of these developments was on providing affordable housing for new home buyers, generally young families.\n\nSome semi-rural land in the western portion, mainly utilised for horse agistment and chicken-farming, was developed in the early 2000s. At one time there were several industrial activities taking place in the north-western portion. The last of these to close, about 2004, was the Ingham chicken-processing factory, the site of which was redeveloped for a residential estate.\n\n== Facilities ==\n[[File:Roe Highway Thornlie Southward SMC.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Roe Highway at the Nicholson Road exit.]]\n\nThornlie is primarily a [[Commuter town|dormitory suburb]] with strong transport links to employment elsewhere in the metropolitan region. Albany Highway connects the suburb to the CBD, [[Roe Highway]] links it the regional road network, bus services are fairly frequent and a passenger rail service terminates at [[Thornlie railway station]]. Retail services are provided through local and neighbourhood centres, the largest of which are Thornlie Square Shopping Centre (1970s) and the Forest Lakes Forum (1990s). A range of sporting facilities are available for community use include lawn bowls, tennis courts, a skate park, swimming pool, gyms and ovals for cricket and football. [[Baseball Park (Perth)|Baseball Park]], built in 2007, is the home of [[Perth Heat]], a team in the [[Australian Baseball League]].\n\n== Community ==\nThornlie has two local papers distributed fortnightly, the ''[[Community_Newspaper_Group#Hills_and_eastern_suburbs|Comment News]]'' and the ''Gosnells Examiner''. 107.3 [[Heritage FM]] is a volunteer run radio station for Thornlie and the City of Gosnells as a whole. Community programmes include the annual Safe City awards including the Community Initiative Award, the Constable Peter Ball Memorial Youth Award and the Community Kids Award.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe percentage of residents born overseas (39.4%) is greater than both the national (27%) and metropolitan (31.3%) average.  11.3% of residents were born in England; 3% in New Zealand, and significant smaller percentages from Malaysia, India and Scotland. 14% of residents speak a language other than English at home. Unemployment (3.4%) is lower than the regional average (3.7%) and socio-economic disadvantage less than the City of Gosnells as whole. Weekly household incomes are characterised by a lower proportion of both low and higher income households compared with the Perth average.

The [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning River]] runs through the northern side of the suburb.

During this time Thornlie's development was aimed at inner city dwellers who might want to live in a more spacious semi-urban-rural setting. It is one reason why Thornlie has typically large {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|order=flip|abbr=on}} blocks and is often described as one of Perth's leafy suburbs.\n\nThe more upmarket [[#Crestwood Estate|Crestwood Estate]], which was an experiment in providing fully integrated facilities and services to home-owners, was established from the early 1970s in the southern part of Thornlie, an experiment which was rarely replicated in later Perth subdivisions.  From the 1980s the newer Castle Glen and Forest Lakes housing estates, which were at that time to some extent in competition with one another for land purchasers, were established in the remaining land in the western and south-western portions of Thornlie.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. The focus of these developments was on providing affordable housing for new home buyers, generally young families.\n\nSome semi-rural land in the western portion, mainly utilised for horse agistment and chicken-farming, was developed in the early 2000s. At one time there were several industrial activities taking place in the north-western portion. The last of these to close, about 2004, was the Ingham chicken-processing factory, the site of which was redeveloped for a residential estate.\n\n== Facilities ==\n[[File:Roe Highway Thornlie Southward SMC.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Roe Highway at the Nicholson Road exit.]]\n\nThornlie is primarily a [[Commuter town|dormitory suburb]] with strong transport links to employment elsewhere in the metropolitan region. Albany Highway connects the suburb to the CBD, [[Roe Highway]] links it the regional road network, bus services are fairly frequent and a passenger rail service terminates at [[Thornlie railway station]]. Retail services are provided through local and neighbourhood centres, the largest of which are Thornlie Square Shopping Centre (1970s) and the Forest Lakes Forum (1990s). A range of sporting facilities are available for community use include lawn bowls, tennis courts, a skate park, swimming pool, gyms and ovals for cricket and football. [[Baseball Park (Perth)|Baseball Park]], built in 2007, is the home of [[Perth Heat]], a team in the [[Australian Baseball League]].\n\n== Community ==\nThornlie has two local papers distributed fortnightly, the ''[[Community_Newspaper_Group#Hills_and_eastern_suburbs|Comment News]]'' and the ''Gosnells Examiner''. 107.3 [[Heritage FM]] is a volunteer run radio station for Thornlie and the City of Gosnells as a whole. Community programmes include the annual Safe City awards including the Community Initiative Award, the Constable Peter Ball Memorial Youth Award and the Community Kids Award.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe percentage of residents born overseas (39.4%) is greater than both the national (27%) and metropolitan (31.3%) average.  11.3% of residents were born in England; 3% in New Zealand, and significant smaller percentages from Malaysia, India and Scotland. 14% of residents speak a language other than English at home. Unemployment (3.4%) is lower than the regional average (3.7%) and socio-economic disadvantage less than the City of Gosnells as whole. Weekly household incomes are characterised by a lower proportion of both low and higher income households compared with the Perth average. There are no major differences between the religious affiliation of Thornlie and the Perth region as a whole. The dominant religion is Catholicism (22.4%) followed by Anglicanism (19.5%), Islam (4.6%) and Buddhism (3.5%). Since 2001 there has been a mild decline in the number of Catholics and Anglicans and an increase in the number of Muslims, by 2002 Thornlie had the highest population of Muslims in Perth.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title=Muslim minorities in the West : visible and invisible / edited by Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad & Jane I.

P. Sanders, the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth narratives]] in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in [[Bethlehem]], in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new [[Moses]], and the historian [[Josephus]] reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that [[Massacre of the Innocents|he massacred little boys]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85\u201388}}\n\nSanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}} In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from [[David]] through Joseph.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=196}} Luke reports that Jesus was a [[Consanguinity|blood relation]] of [[John the Baptist]], but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}}<ref name=\"ActJBirth\">[[Robert W.

Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. p. 294</ref>\n\nThe Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in the Gospel of Matthew or the parallel [[Sermon on the Plain]] in Luke. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17\u201362}} While Jesus' [[miracle]]s fit within the social context of [[Ancient history|antiquity]], he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to [[end time]]s prophecy.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=310}}\n\nJesus chose [[Apostle (Christian)|twelve disciples]] {{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} (the \"Twelve\"), evidently as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] message.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke's list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians were not certain who all the disciples were.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} The twelve disciples might have represented the twelve original [[Twelve Tribes of Israel|tribes of Israel]], which would be restored once God's rule was instituted.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom (Matthew 19:28, Luke 22:30).{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included [[Judas Iscariot]]. In Ehrman's view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}}\nIn Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}} They serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Jesus and to other characters.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}} The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nSanders says that Jesus' mission was not about [[repentance]], although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was [[John the Baptist]]'s message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230\u201336}} According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}\n\n====Role====\nJesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the \"[[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]\", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24\u201327, Matthew 24:29\u201331, Luke 21:25\u201328). He referred to himself as a \"[[son of man]]\" in the colloquial sense of \"a person\", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly \"Son of Man\". [[Paul the Apostle]] and other early Christians interpreted the \"Son of Man\" as the risen Jesus.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThe title [[Christ (title)|Christ]], or [[Messiah]], indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King [[David]], whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as \"the Messiah\" or, equivalently, \"the Christ\". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as \"his Messiah\". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his [[Eschatology|eschatological]] role as that of the Messiah.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Messiah}} The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Based on the Christian tradition, [[Gerd Theissen]] advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title \"Messiah\".{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/judas-and-the-messianic-secret/ |title=Judas and the Messianic Secret|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> not in the sense that most people today think of the term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-claim-to-be-the-messiah/ |title=Jesus' Claim to be the Messiah|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem====\nAround AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from [[Galilee]] to [[Jerusalem]] to observe [[Passover]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} Jesus caused a disturbance in the [[Second Temple]],{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=254\u201362}} Jesus held a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. His words as recorded in the Synoptic gospels and Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Letter to the Corinthians]] do not entirely agree, but this symbolic meal appears to have pointed to Jesus' place in the coming Kingdom of God when very probably Jesus knew he was about to be killed, although he may have still hoped that God might yet intervene.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=263\u201364}}\n\nThe Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} He was executed on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=465\u201366}} The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}<ref name=\"JE1906\"/> Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=269\u201373}} Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Meier|2006|pp=126\u201328}}\n\n====After crucifixion====\n[[File:The Resurrection Beaufort arms in border (f. 131) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century manuscript of ''La Passion de Nostre Seigneur'']]\nAfter Jesus' death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=276\u201381}} On the other hand, [[L.

A disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like [[John the Baptist]] and [[Paul the Apostle]]. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as [[Burton Mack]] and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] than an apocalyptic preacher.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=1\u201315}} In addition to portraying Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, a charismatic healer or a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic philosopher]], some scholars portray him as the true Messiah or an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] prophet of [[social change]].<ref name=\"CambHist23\">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity| volume= 1 |first1= Margaret M.|last1= Mitchell |first2= Frances M. |last2=Young |year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-521-81239-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press| page= 23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&pg=PA23 }}</ref>{{sfn|K\u00f6stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124\u201325}} However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Why Study the Historical Jesus? | encyclopedia=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus | publisher=Brill | year=2011 | first=Colin | last=Brown | page=1416 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuKMmVu0tpMC&pg=PA1416 | isbn=978-90-04-16372-0 | editor1-first=Tom | editor1-last=Holmen | editor2-first=Stanley E. | editor2-last=Porter }}</ref>\n\nSince the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible.

Both accounts have Jesus born in [[Bethlehem]], in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new [[Moses]], and the historian [[Josephus]] reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that [[Massacre of the Innocents|he massacred little boys]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85\u201388}}\n\nSanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}} In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from [[David]] through Joseph.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=196}} Luke reports that Jesus was a [[Consanguinity|blood relation]] of [[John the Baptist]], but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}}<ref name=\"ActJBirth\">[[Robert W.

According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17\u201362}} While Jesus' [[miracle]]s fit within the social context of [[Ancient history|antiquity]], he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed.

He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was [[John the Baptist]]'s message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230\u201336}} According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}\n\n====Role====\nJesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the \"[[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]\", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24\u201327, Matthew 24:29\u201331, Luke 21:25\u201328). He referred to himself as a \"[[son of man]]\" in the colloquial sense of \"a person\", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly \"Son of Man\". [[Paul the Apostle]] and other early Christians interpreted the \"Son of Man\" as the risen Jesus.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThe title [[Christ (title)|Christ]], or [[Messiah]], indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King [[David]], whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as \"the Messiah\" or, equivalently, \"the Christ\". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as \"his Messiah\".
