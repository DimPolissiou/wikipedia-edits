The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal.

His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing.

The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing sales over the last three years. It is published in [[The Sunday Times]] each December, with a conference and awards event typically held in May<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-virgin-atlantic-fast-track-100-awards-qtqtr63nf|title=Sunday Times Virgin Atlantic Fast Track 100 awards|date=19 May 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, and alumni dinners during the year. The list is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business. Sir Richard Brandon and the [[Virgin Group]] have supported the Fast Track 100 league table since Hamish Stevenson founded Fast Track in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

This tradition showed a preference for sweeping views with craggy rocks in the distance and a blue-greenish palette.  The influence of this tradition is visible in his earliest known painting, the [[:File:Jacques Fouquier - Winter Landscape - WGA08044.jpg|''Winter landscape'']] of 1617, now in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

In this development he followed in the footsteps of [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] a generation before him.  He does not follow van Coninxloo in the direction of-a more naturalistic display of leaves, but he maintains the abbreviated, schematic treatment of foliage to concentrate rather on the new compositional ideas: uniform space in the foreground and middle ground rather than the stratification of the foreground, middle ground and distant portions and the romantic rocks of the de Momper school, only occasional perspective into the distance, greater ability to draw the viewer into the image, and above all an harmonization of color with more emphasis on light and the direction of the light: The color scheme, especially in the background , points to later developments in the 17th century such as seen in the works of [[Gaspard Dughet]] and [[Jacques d'Arthois]].<ref name=deut/>  The question has been raised as to whether the change in style is attributable to Fouquier's collaborations with Rubens.<ref name=stech/>  No clearly documented works from after the style change are known.

It was provoked by the exacting attitude of Foucquier vis-\u00e0-vis Poussin in relation to the decoration of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre palace. Foucquier insisted his landscapes be the principal decorations. In a letter to [[Paul Fr\u00e9art de Chantelou]], Poussin made fun of \"le baron Foucquier\" and is said to have avenged himself after his escape from Paris associated with the dispute in an allegory in which Foucquier was represented by a donkey on which [[Jacques Lemercier]] sat enthroned as the queen of stupidity.<ref name=stech/>\n[[File:Jacques Fouquier - Winter Landscape - WGA08044.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Winter landscape'', 1617, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]]]\n\nFouquier lived in 1644 together with Flemish artists Philippe Vleughels, [[Pieter van Mol]], [[Willem Kalf]], [[Nicasius Bernaerts]] and [[Peter van Boucle]] in Paris.<ref name=rkd/>  He died at the end of 1655 in a room given to him by the painter Sylvain in the Fauxbourg Saint Jacques in Paris.

This tradition showed a preference for sweeping views with craggy rocks in the distance and a blue-greenish palette.  The influence of this tradition is visible in his earliest known painting, the [[:File:Jacques Fouquier - Winter Landscape - WGA08044.jpg|''Winter landscape'']] of 1617, now in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

In this development he followed in the footsteps of [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] a generation before him.  He does not follow van Coninxloo in the direction of-a more naturalistic display of leaves, but he maintains the abbreviated, schematic treatment of foliage to concentrate rather on the new compositional ideas: uniform space in the foreground and middle ground rather than the stratification of the foreground, middle ground and distant portions and the romantic rocks of the de Momper school, only occasional perspective into the distance, greater ability to draw the viewer into the image, and above all an harmonization of color with more emphasis on light and the direction of the light: The color scheme, especially in the background , points to later developments in the 17th century such as seen in the works of [[Gaspard Dughet]] and [[Jacques d'Arthois]].<ref name=deut/>  The question has been raised as to whether the change in style is attributable to Fouquier's collaborations with Rubens.<ref name=stech/>  No clearly documented works from after the style change are known.

The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M.

The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).

In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}.

Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card.

For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.\n\n;Nanoscale network\nA [[IEEE P1906.1|nanoscale communication]] network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S.

Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org]. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two [[IP address]]es. The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes. This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J. Klensin (October 2008)</ref> [[printing]] and [[distributed file system|network file sharing]] are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as DNS ([[Domain Name System]]) give names for [[Internet protocol|IP]] and [[MAC address]]es (people remember names like \u201cnm.lan\u201d better than numbers like \u201c210.121.67.18\u201d),<ref name=\"rfc1035\">{{IETF RFC|1035}}, \"Domain names \u2013 Implementation and Specification\", P.

The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]]. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111015452/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |author=ITU-D Study Group 2 |date=June 2006 |title=Teletraffic Engineering Handbook}}</ref> Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\n*ATM: In an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [[quality of service]] (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.<ref>[http://www.telecommagazine.com/ Telecommunications Magazine Online], Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005.</ref>{{verification needed |date=August 2018}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.  Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.\n\n=== Network surveillance ===\n[[Network surveillance]] is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

Two such devices can be said to be networked when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. In most cases, application-specific communications [[Communication protocol|protocols]] are [[Communications protocol#Layering|layered]] (i.e. carried as [[Payload (computing)|payload]]) over other more general communications protocols.\n\nComputer networks support many [[Application software|applications]] and [[Network service|services]], such as access to the [[World Wide Web]], [[digital video]], [[digital audio]], shared use of [[File server|application and storage servers]], printers, and [[Fax|fax machines]], and use of [[email]] and [[instant messaging]] applications.

The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M.

The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).  Academic research includes end system multicast,<ref>{{cite web |title= End System Multicast |work= project web site |url= http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |publisher= Carnegie Mellon University |accessdate= May 25, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050221110350/http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |archivedate= February 21, 2005 }}</ref> resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\n\n== Network links ==\n{{further|Data transmission}}\nThe transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the ''[[Transmission medium|physical medium]]'') used to link devices to form a computer network include [[electrical cable]], [[optical fiber]], and [[radio waves]]. In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}.

Hooke |date=September 2000 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\nBoth cases have a large [[round-trip delay time]], which gives slow two-way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information.\n\n== Network nodes ==\n{{Main|Node (networking)}}\nApart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic [[Systems engineering|system]] building blocks, such as [[network interface controller]]s (NICs), [[repeater]]s, [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[Network bridge|bridges]], [[Network switch|switches]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[modem]]s, and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]\nA [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that connects the computer to the [[network media]] and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.\n\n;Nanoscale network\nA [[IEEE P1906.1|nanoscale communication]] network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S. F. |isbn=978-1-60807-003-9 |publisher=Artech House |year=2010 }}</ref>\n\n;Personal area network\nA [[personal area network]] (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org].

This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J. Klensin (October 2008)</ref> [[printing]] and [[distributed file system|network file sharing]] are examples of well-known network services.

The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]].

Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.  Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.\n\n=== Network surveillance ===\n[[Network surveillance]] is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

Early translators of Kavi manuscripts misunderstood the \"being a son of\" and assumed that Vishnu actually had human offspring and so on. Here however we must conclude a belonging to a religious school of thought, Vaisnavism. Therefore, early Hinduism on Java, Bali, and Sumatra consisted of both main schools of Hinduism.\nTherefore, historical evidence is not entirely unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to [[78 AD]]. Stories from the [[Mahabharata]] Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; whose versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now [[Tamil Nadu]] and southern [[Andhra Pradesh]]).<ref name=jgonda/> The Javanese prose work ''[[Tantu Pagelaran]]'' of the 14th century, which is a collection of ancient tales, arts and crafts of Indonesia, extensively uses [[Sanskrit]] words, Indian deity names and religious concepts.

In the early seventies, the [[Toraja]] people of [[Sulawesi]] were the first to realize this opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the [[Karo Batak]] of [[Sumatra]] in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous [[Dayak people|Dayak]] population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, this was different from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly  population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.\n\nCompared to their counterparts among Javanese Hindus, many Dayak leaders were also more deeply concerned about Balinese efforts to standardize Hindu ritual practice nationally; fearing a decline of their own unique 'Hindu Kaharingan' traditions and renewed external domination. By contrast, most Javanese were slow to consider Hinduism at the time, lacking a distinct organization along ethnic lines and fearing retribution from locally powerful Islamic organizations like the Nahdatul Ulama (NU).\n\nSeveral native tribal peoples with beliefs such as [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Sunda Wiwitan]], [[Toraja]]n Aluk To Dolo, and [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] [[Parmalim|Malim]], with their own unique syncretic faith, have declared themselves as Hindus in order to comply with Indonesian law, while preserving their distinct traditions with differences from mainstream Indonesian Hinduism dominated by the Balinese.

The earliest evidences of Hindu influences in Java can be found in 4th century [[Tarumanagara]] inscriptions scattered around modern [[Jakarta]] and [[Bogor]]. In the sixth and seventh centuries many maritime kingdoms arose in Sumatra and Java which controlled the waters in the [[Straits of Malacca]] and flourished with the increasing sea trade between China and India and beyond. During this time, scholars from India and China visited these kingdoms to translate literary and religious texts.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 15th century, Java had many Hindu kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara, [[Kalingga]], [[Medang Kingdom|Medang]], [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]]. This era is popularly known as the Javanese Classical Era, during which Hindu-Buddhist literature, art and architecture flourished and were incorporated into local culture under royal patronage. During this time, many Hindu temples were built, including 9th century [[Prambanan]] near [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], which has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. Among these Hindu kingdoms, Majapahit kingdom was the largest and the last significant Hindu kingdom in [[Indonesian history]]. Majapahit was based in East Java, from where it ruled a large part of what is now Indonesia.

Although the vast majority of Javanese now identify as Muslim, these art forms still survive. Hinduism has survived in varying degrees and forms on Java.

For the Tengger, [[Mount Bromo]] ([[Brahma]]) is believed to be a holy mountain. Every year the Tengger hold a ritual known as [[Yadnya Kasada]].\n\n==Osing Hindus of Java==\nIn spite of the Dutch attempts to propagate Islam and Christianity among the Osings, some of them still stuck to their old beliefs.

Bali had the highest concentration of Hindus with 88.05% of its population professing Hinduism agama. The percentage of Hindus in the total population declined from the 1990 census, and this is largely attributed to lower birth rates and immigration of Muslims from Java into provinces with high Hindu populations.

It celebrates the coming of the gods and the ancestral spirits to earth to dwell again in the homes of their descendants. The festivities are characterized by offerings, dances and new clothes. The ancestors must be suitably entertained and welcomed, and prayers and offerings must be made for them. Families whose ancestors have not been cremated yet, but remain buried in the village cemetery, must make offerings at the graves. [[Kuningan]] is the last day of the holiday, when the gods and ancestors depart until the next Galungan.\n*[[Saraswati|Hari Raya Saraswati]] is dedicated the goddess of learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal of life as a human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, [[Brahma]], who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, [[Shatarupa]]. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar ([[palm-leaf manuscripts]]), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese [[Pawukon]] calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balispirit.com/events/bali_ceremony_ritual.html |title=Bali Cultural Ceremony and Ritual |publisher=Balispirit.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref>\n*[[Nyepi|Hari Raya Nyepi]] is a Hindu Day of Silence or the Hindu New Year in the Balinese Saka calendar. The largest celebrations are held in Bali as well as in Balinese Hindu communities around Indonesia. On New Year's Eve the villages are cleaned, food is cooked for two days and in the evening as much noise is made as possible to scare away the devils. On the following day, Hindus do not leave their homes, cook or engage in any activity. Streets are deserted, and tourists are not allowed to leave hotel complexes.  The day following Nyepi night, everything stops for a day except emergency services such as ambulances.<ref>Nyoman S. Pendit (2001), Nyepi: kebangkitan, toleransi, dan kerukunan, Gramedia Pustaka Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9796865710}}</ref> Nyepi is determined using the Balinese calendar, the eve of Nyepi falling on the night of the new moon whenever it occurs around March/April each year. Therefore, the date for Nyepi changes every year. Nyepi night is a night of community gathering and burning of effigies island-wide (similar to Karthikai in South India), while the next day is the day of total peace and quiet.\n\n==Social life==\n[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, Candi Siliwangi Shrine.jpg|thumb|Balinese Hindus built a shrine dedicated to [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Hindu]] [[King Siliwangi|King Sri Baduga Maharaja Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata]] in [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]], [[Bogor]], West Java.]]\n[[File:Pony, Mount Bromo (Gunung Bromo) Indonesia, East Java.jpg|thumb|[[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] Hindu temple at [[Tengger massif|Tengger]] caldera in [[East Java]]]]\n[[File:Mall culture jakarta12.jpg|thumb|Many [[Indonesians]] (no matter what religion) use Hindu names such as [[Vishnu|Wisnu]], [[Surya]], [[Indra]], [[Arya]], [[Putra (name)|Putra]], [[Aditya]], [[Sita]], etc. The [[Indonesian National Police|police officer]] above has the name written \"Tri Wisnu\".]]\nA common feature among new Hindu communities in Java is that they tend to rally around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship.\n\nThe ''Parisada Hindu Dharma'' changed its name to ''Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia'' in 1984, in recognition of its national influence spearheaded by [[Gedong Bagus Oka]]. One of several new Hindu temples in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of [[Semeru|Mt. Semeru]], Java's highest mountain. When the temple was completed in July 1992, with the generous aid of wealthy donors from Bali, only a few local families formally confessed to Hinduism. A pilot study in December 1999 revealed that the local Hindu community now has grown to more than 5000 households.\n\nSimilar mass conversions have occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of [[Blambangan]], the last Hindu polity on Java. A further important site is Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri), where the Hindu king and prophet [[Jayabaya]] is said to have achieved spiritual liberation ([[moksa]]).\n\nA further Hindu movement in the earliest stages of development was observed in the vicinity of the newly completed Pura Pucak Raung (in the Eastern Javanese district of [[Glenmore (Indonesia)|Glenmore]]), which is mentioned in [[Balinese literature]] as the place where the Hindu saint [[Maharishi Markandeya]] gathered followers for an expedition to Bali, whereby he is said to have brought Hinduism to the island in the fifth century AD.\n\nAn example of resurgence around major archaeological remains of ancient Hindu temple sites was observed in [[Trowulan]] near Mojokerto. The site may be the location of the capital of the Hindu empire [[Majapahit]]. A local Hindu movement is struggling to gain control of a newly excavated temple building which they wish to see restored as a site of active [[Hindu]] worship. The temple is to be dedicated to Gajah Mada, the man attributed with transforming the small [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Majapahit]] into an empire.\n\nIn [[Karanganyar Regency|Karanganyar]] region in Central Java, the renovated 14th century [[Cetho]] temple on the slope of [[Mount Lawu]] has become the center of Javanese Hinduism and gain patronage of Balinese temples and royal houses.\nA new [http://www.sahasraadhipura.org/ temple] is being built East of Solo ([[Surakarta]]). It is a Hindu temple that has miniatures of 50 sacred sites around the world. It is also an active kundalini yoga meditation center teaching the sacred Javanese tradition of sun and water meditation. There are many westerners as well as Javanese joining in.\n\nAlthough there has been a more pronounced history of resistance to Islamization in East Java, Hindu communities are also expanding in Central Java (Lyon 1980), for example in [[Klaten]], near the ancient Hindu monuments of [[Prambanan]]. Today the Prambanan temple stages various annual Hindu ceremonies and festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.\n\nIn [[West Java]], a Hindu temple [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]] was built on the slope of [[Mount Salak]] near the historic site of ancient [[Sunda Kingdom]] capital, [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] in modern [[Bogor]]. The temple, dubbed as the largest Balinese Hindu temple ever built outside Bali, was meant as the main temple for the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] Hindu population in the [[Greater Jakarta]] region. However, because the temple stands in a Sundanese sacred place, and also hosts a shrine dedicated to the famous Sundanese king, [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]], the site has gain popularity among [[Sundanese people|locals]] who wish to reconnect their ties with the ancestors.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Odalan procession.JPG|thumb|right|Colourful and festive Hindu rituals of Bali is one of island's attraction]]\nThe predominantly Hindu island of Bali is the largest tourist draw in Indonesia.<ref>[http://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/foreign-tourist-arrivals-to-indonesia-jump-22.6-in-january-2014/item1716 Foreign Tourist Arrivals to Indonesia Jump 22.6% in January 2014]</ref> Next to natural beauty, the temple architecture, the elaborate Hindu festivals, rich culture, colorful art and vivid dances are the main attractions of Balinese [[Tourism in Indonesia|tourism]].

Therefore, early Hinduism on Java, Bali, and Sumatra consisted of both main schools of Hinduism.\nTherefore, historical evidence is not entirely unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to [[78 AD]]. Stories from the [[Mahabharata]] Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; whose versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now [[Tamil Nadu]] and southern [[Andhra Pradesh]]).<ref name=jgonda/> The Javanese prose work ''[[Tantu Pagelaran]]'' of the 14th century, which is a collection of ancient tales, arts and crafts of Indonesia, extensively uses [[Sanskrit]] words, Indian deity names and religious concepts.

The petitioners identified ''Ida Sanghyang Widhi Wasa'' as the undivided one. In the Balinese language this term has two meanings: the Divine ruler of the Universe and the Divine Absolute Cosmic Law.

In the early seventies, the [[Toraja]] people of [[Sulawesi]] were the first to realize this opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the [[Karo Batak]] of [[Sumatra]] in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous [[Dayak people|Dayak]] population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, this was different from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly  population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.\n\nCompared to their counterparts among Javanese Hindus, many Dayak leaders were also more deeply concerned about Balinese efforts to standardize Hindu ritual practice nationally; fearing a decline of their own unique 'Hindu Kaharingan' traditions and renewed external domination. By contrast, most Javanese were slow to consider Hinduism at the time, lacking a distinct organization along ethnic lines and fearing retribution from locally powerful Islamic organizations like the Nahdatul Ulama (NU).\n\nSeveral native tribal peoples with beliefs such as [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Sunda Wiwitan]], [[Toraja]]n Aluk To Dolo, and [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] [[Parmalim|Malim]], with their own unique syncretic faith, have declared themselves as Hindus in order to comply with Indonesian law, while preserving their distinct traditions with differences from mainstream Indonesian Hinduism dominated by the Balinese.

The epics ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' became enduring traditions among Indonesian believers, expressed in shadow puppet (''[[wayang]]'') and dance performances. As in India, Indonesian Hinduism recognizes four paths of spirituality, calling it ''Catur Marga''.<ref name=murdana>Murdana, I.

Bhakti marga has the largest following in Bali.<ref name=murdana/> Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it ''Catur Purusartha'' - [[dharma]] (pursuit of moral and ethical living), [[artha]] (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), [[kama]] (pursuit of joy and love) and [[moksha]] (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).<ref>Ida Bagus Sudirga (2009), Widya Dharma - Agama Hindu, Ganeca Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9795711773}}</ref><ref>IGP Sugandhi (2005), Seni (Rupa) Bali Hindu Dalam Perspektif Epistemologi Brahma Widya, Ornamen, Vol 2, Number 1, pp. 58-69</ref>\n\n==Balinese Hinduism==\n{{main|Balinese Hinduism}}\n[[File:1 pura ulun danu bratan 2011b.jpg|thumb|200px|One of many Hindu temples in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Ubud 0704a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Balinese temple|temple]] offering in Bali]]\nBalinese Hinduism is an amalgamation of Indian religions and indigenous animist customs that existed in Indonesian archipelago before the arrival of Islam and later Dutch colonialism.<ref name=nsimmonds>Nigel Simmonds, Bali: Morning of the World, Periplus, {{ISBN|978-0804843966}}, pp. 41-43</ref> It integrates many of the core beliefs of Hinduism with arts and rituals of Balinese people. In contemporary times, Hinduism in Bali is officially referred by Indonesian Ministry of Religion as ''Agama Hindu Dharma'', but traditionally the religion was called by many names such as Tirta, Trimurti, Hindu, Agama Tirta, Siwa, Buda, and Siwa-Buda.<ref name=mprm>Michel Picard and R\u00e9my Madinier, The Politics of Religion in Indonesia - Syncretism, Orthodoxy, and Religious Contention in Java and Bali, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415613118}}, Chapter 5 and notes to the chapter</ref> The terms Tirta and Trimurti emanate from Indian Hinduism, corresponding to Tirtha (pilgrimage to spirituality near holy waters) and Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) respectively. As in India, Hinduism in Bali grew with flexibility, featuring a diverse way of life. It includes many of the Indian spiritual ideas, cherishes legends and myths of Indian [[Purana]]s and Hindu Epics, as well as expresses its traditions through unique set of festivals and customs associated with a myriad of [[hyang]]s - the local and ancestral spirits, as well as forms of animal sacrifice that are not common in India.<ref name=mprm/>\n\n;Balinese Hindu temple\n{{main|Balinese temple}}\nThe [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temple]] is called ''Pura''. These temples are designed on square [[Hindu temple]] plan, as an open air worship place within enclosed walls, connected with series of intricately decorated gates to reach its compounds.<ref>Julian Davison (2003), Introduction to Balinese Architecture, Periplus, {{ISBN|978-0794600716}}, pp 32-45</ref> Each of these temples has a more or less fixed membership; every Balinese belongs to a temple by virtue of descent, residence, or affiliation. Some house temples are associated with the family house compound (also called ''banjar'' in Bali), others are associated with rice fields, and still others with key geographic sites. In rural highlands of Bali, ''banua'' (or ''wanwa'', forest domain) temples in each ''desa'' (village) are common.<ref name=tar2>Thomas Anton Reuter (2002), Custodians of the Sacred Mountains: Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824824501}}, Chapter 1</ref> The island of Bali has over 20,000 temples, or about one temple for every 100 to 200 people.<ref>Janet Descutner (2004), Asian Dance, {{ISBN|978-0791077771}}, pp. 66</ref> Temples are dedicated to local spirits as well as to deities found in India; for example, Saraswati, Ganesha, Wisnu, Siwa, Parvati, Arjuna, and others. The temple design similarly amalgamate architectural principles in Hindu temples of India and regional ideas.\n\nEach individual has a family deity, called Kula dewa, who resides in the temple called the family temple that the individual and his family patronize. Balinese Hindu follow a 210-day calendar (based on rice crop and lunar cycles), and each temple celebrates its anniversary once every 210 days.<ref name=nsimmonds/> Unique rituals and festivals of Balinese Hindus, that are not found in India, include those related to death of a loved one followed by cremations, cockfights, tooth filings, Nyepi and Galungan. Each temple anniversary, as well as festivals and family events such as wedding include flowers, offerings, towering bamboos with decoration at the end and a procession. These are celebrated by the community with prayers and feast.<ref name=nsimmonds/> Most festivals have a temple as venue, and they are often occasions for prayers, celebration of arts and community. Some traditions, in contrast, involve animist rituals such as ''caru'' (animal blood sacrifice) such as ''Tabuh Rah'' (lethal cockfighting) or killing of an animal to appease ''buta kala'' (spirits of the earth) - however, the animal sacrifices are conducted outside the premises of a temple.<ref name=tar2/><ref>[Indonesia Handbook,  3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, & Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint - Travel Guides) 2001</ref>\n\n;Balinese Hindu arts\n{{main|Balinese art}}\nDance, music, colorful ceremonial dresses and other arts are a notable feature of religious expression among Balinese Hindus. As in India, these expressions celebrate various mudra to express ideas, grace, decorum and culture. Dance-drama is common. Various stories are expressed. For example, one involves a battle between the mythical characters [[Rangda]] the witch (representing adharma, something like disorder) and [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] the protective spirit represented with a lion mask (representing [[dharma]]), in which performers fall into a trance, the good attempts to conquer evil, the dancers express the idea that good and evil exists within each individual, and that conquering evil implies ejecting evil from oneself. The dance-drama regularly ends undecided, neither side winning, because the primary purpose is to restore balance and recognize that the battle between dharma and adharma (good and evil) is within each person and a never ending one.<ref>Jane Belo (1966), Bali: Rangda and Barong, University of Washington Press, {{ISBN|978-0404629151}}</ref> [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]], or [[dharma]], is a major symbolic and ritual paradigm found in various festivities, dances, arts and temples.<ref>Thomas Anton Reuter (2002), Custodians of the Sacred Mountains: Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824824501}}, pp 171</ref>\n\nRituals of the life cycle are also important occasions for religious expression and artistic display. Ceremonies at puberty, marriage, and, most notably, cremation at death provide opportunities for Balinese to communicate their ideas about community, status, and the afterlife.\n\n;Balinese Hindu society\nScholars<ref name=mprm/><ref>Sanger, Annette (1985), Music, dance, and social organization in two Balinese villages, Indonesia Circle, School of Oriental & African Studies, Routledge, 13(37), pp. 45-62</ref> dispute the degree and nature of social stratification in medieval and contemporary Balinese Hindu society. The social structure consisted of ''catur wangsa'' (four varnas) - ''brahmana'' (priests), ''satriya'' or \"Deva\" (warriors), ''waisya'' (merchants), and ''sudra'' (farmers, artisans, commoners).<ref>Howe, L.E.A.

The earliest evidences of Hindu influences in Java can be found in 4th century [[Tarumanagara]] inscriptions scattered around modern [[Jakarta]] and [[Bogor]]. In the sixth and seventh centuries many maritime kingdoms arose in Sumatra and Java which controlled the waters in the [[Straits of Malacca]] and flourished with the increasing sea trade between China and India and beyond. During this time, scholars from India and China visited these kingdoms to translate literary and religious texts.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 15th century, Java had many Hindu kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara, [[Kalingga]], [[Medang Kingdom|Medang]], [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]]. This era is popularly known as the Javanese Classical Era, during which Hindu-Buddhist literature, art and architecture flourished and were incorporated into local culture under royal patronage. During this time, many Hindu temples were built, including 9th century [[Prambanan]] near [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], which has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. Among these Hindu kingdoms, Majapahit kingdom was the largest and the last significant Hindu kingdom in [[Indonesian history]]. Majapahit was based in East Java, from where it ruled a large part of what is now Indonesia. The remnants of the Majapahit kingdom shifted to [[Bali]] during the sixteenth century after a prolonged war by and territorial losses to Islamic sultanates.<ref name=\"Jean Gelman Taylor pp. 21-83\"/>\n\nThe heritage of Hinduism left a significant impact and imprint in [[Javanese people|Javanese]] art and culture. The [[wayang]] puppet performance as well as [[wayang wong]] dance and other Javanese classical dances are derived from episodes of Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Although the vast majority of Javanese now identify as Muslim, these art forms still survive. Hinduism has survived in varying degrees and forms on Java. Certain ethnic groups in Java, such as the [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]] and [[Osing people|Osing]], are also associated with Hindu religious traditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Tengger Hindus of Java==\n[[File:PuraLuhurPoten.jpg|thumb|Pura Luhur Poten in [[Mount Bromo]]]]\nThe [[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] community follows a Hindu tradition stretching back to the Majapahit Empire. There are strong similarities between the Hinduism in [[Bali]] and the Tengger variety; both are called [[Hindu Dharma]]. However, the Tengger variety does not have a caste system and the Tengger people's traditions are based on those originating from the [[Majapahit]] era. For the Tengger, [[Mount Bromo]] ([[Brahma]]) is believed to be a holy mountain. Every year the Tengger hold a ritual known as [[Yadnya Kasada]].\n\n==Osing Hindus of Java==\nIn spite of the Dutch attempts to propagate Islam and Christianity among the Osings, some of them still stuck to their old beliefs. Today Hinduism still exists among the Osing population.\nThe Osings share a similar culture and spirit with the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], and the Hindus celebrate ceremonies like Nyepi. Just like the [[Balinese people]], the Osing people also share the [[puputan]] tradition. The Osing people differs from the [[Balinese people]] in terms of social stratification. The Osing people does not practice [[caste system]] like the [[Balinese people]], even though if they are Hindus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Robert Hefner, Hindu Javanese, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691028569}}</ref>\n\n==Hinduism elsewhere in the archipelago==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vrouwen maken een rondgang bij de Hindoe tempel Sri Mariamman TMnr 20018361.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tamil Hindus walking around the [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Medan|Sri Mariamman Temple]], in [[Medan]]]] \nAmong the non-Balinese communities considered to be Hindu by the government are, for example, the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] adherents of the [[Kaharingan]] religion in [[Kalimantan Tengah]], where government statistics counted Hindus as 15.8% of the population {{as of|1995|lc=on}}.

Bali had the highest concentration of Hindus with 88.05% of its population professing Hinduism agama. The percentage of Hindus in the total population declined from the 1990 census, and this is largely attributed to lower birth rates and immigration of Muslims from Java into provinces with high Hindu populations. In Central Kalimantan there has been progressive settlement of Madurese from Madura.<ref>{{cite web |author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) - Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/8B48F0B6DD311D70C1257566005C542D?OpenDocument |title=West and Central Kalimantan: Limited livelihood opportunities and failed compensation for lost property hamper recovery of Madurese returnees |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |accessdate=2010-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731095855/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/8B48F0B6DD311D70C1257566005C542D?OpenDocument |archivedate=2010-07-31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108407.htm |title=Indonesia |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mopw.gov.pk/ulema/papers/Indonesia/Table%20Mr%5B1%5D.%20Rozy%20Munir.xls 1 mopw.gov.pk]{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://bimashindu.kemenag.go.id/data-umat.php?year=2009&Submit=Cari Data Umat Hindu Tahun 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425143044/http://bimashindu.kemenag.go.id/data-umat.php?year=2009&Submit=Cari |date=2012-04-25 }}</ref> The details are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed sortable\"\n|-\n!

It celebrates the coming of the gods and the ancestral spirits to earth to dwell again in the homes of their descendants. The festivities are characterized by offerings, dances and new clothes. The ancestors must be suitably entertained and welcomed, and prayers and offerings must be made for them. Families whose ancestors have not been cremated yet, but remain buried in the village cemetery, must make offerings at the graves. [[Kuningan]] is the last day of the holiday, when the gods and ancestors depart until the next Galungan.\n*[[Saraswati|Hari Raya Saraswati]] is dedicated the goddess of learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal of life as a human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, [[Brahma]], who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, [[Shatarupa]]. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar ([[palm-leaf manuscripts]]), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese [[Pawukon]] calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balispirit.com/events/bali_ceremony_ritual.html |title=Bali Cultural Ceremony and Ritual |publisher=Balispirit.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref>\n*[[Nyepi|Hari Raya Nyepi]] is a Hindu Day of Silence or the Hindu New Year in the Balinese Saka calendar. The largest celebrations are held in Bali as well as in Balinese Hindu communities around Indonesia. On New Year's Eve the villages are cleaned, food is cooked for two days and in the evening as much noise is made as possible to scare away the devils. On the following day, Hindus do not leave their homes, cook or engage in any activity. Streets are deserted, and tourists are not allowed to leave hotel complexes.  The day following Nyepi night, everything stops for a day except emergency services such as ambulances.<ref>Nyoman S. Pendit (2001), Nyepi: kebangkitan, toleransi, dan kerukunan, Gramedia Pustaka Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9796865710}}</ref> Nyepi is determined using the Balinese calendar, the eve of Nyepi falling on the night of the new moon whenever it occurs around March/April each year. Therefore, the date for Nyepi changes every year. Nyepi night is a night of community gathering and burning of effigies island-wide (similar to Karthikai in South India), while the next day is the day of total peace and quiet.\n\n==Social life==\n[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, Candi Siliwangi Shrine.jpg|thumb|Balinese Hindus built a shrine dedicated to [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Hindu]] [[King Siliwangi|King Sri Baduga Maharaja Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata]] in [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]], [[Bogor]], West Java.]]\n[[File:Pony, Mount Bromo (Gunung Bromo) Indonesia, East Java.jpg|thumb|[[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] Hindu temple at [[Tengger massif|Tengger]] caldera in [[East Java]]]]\n[[File:Mall culture jakarta12.jpg|thumb|Many [[Indonesians]] (no matter what religion) use Hindu names such as [[Vishnu|Wisnu]], [[Surya]], [[Indra]], [[Arya]], [[Putra (name)|Putra]], [[Aditya]], [[Sita]], etc. The [[Indonesian National Police|police officer]] above has the name written \"Tri Wisnu\".]]\nA common feature among new Hindu communities in Java is that they tend to rally around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship.\n\nThe ''Parisada Hindu Dharma'' changed its name to ''Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia'' in 1984, in recognition of its national influence spearheaded by [[Gedong Bagus Oka]]. One of several new Hindu temples in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of [[Semeru|Mt. Semeru]], Java's highest mountain. When the temple was completed in July 1992, with the generous aid of wealthy donors from Bali, only a few local families formally confessed to Hinduism. A pilot study in December 1999 revealed that the local Hindu community now has grown to more than 5000 households.\n\nSimilar mass conversions have occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of [[Blambangan]], the last Hindu polity on Java. A further important site is Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri), where the Hindu king and prophet [[Jayabaya]] is said to have achieved spiritual liberation ([[moksa]]).\n\nA further Hindu movement in the earliest stages of development was observed in the vicinity of the newly completed Pura Pucak Raung (in the Eastern Javanese district of [[Glenmore (Indonesia)|Glenmore]]), which is mentioned in [[Balinese literature]] as the place where the Hindu saint [[Maharishi Markandeya]] gathered followers for an expedition to Bali, whereby he is said to have brought Hinduism to the island in the fifth century AD.\n\nAn example of resurgence around major archaeological remains of ancient Hindu temple sites was observed in [[Trowulan]] near Mojokerto. The site may be the location of the capital of the Hindu empire [[Majapahit]]. A local Hindu movement is struggling to gain control of a newly excavated temple building which they wish to see restored as a site of active [[Hindu]] worship. The temple is to be dedicated to Gajah Mada, the man attributed with transforming the small [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Majapahit]] into an empire.\n\nIn [[Karanganyar Regency|Karanganyar]] region in Central Java, the renovated 14th century [[Cetho]] temple on the slope of [[Mount Lawu]] has become the center of Javanese Hinduism and gain patronage of Balinese temples and royal houses.\nA new [http://www.sahasraadhipura.org/ temple] is being built East of Solo ([[Surakarta]]). It is a Hindu temple that has miniatures of 50 sacred sites around the world. It is also an active kundalini yoga meditation center teaching the sacred Javanese tradition of sun and water meditation. There are many westerners as well as Javanese joining in.\n\nAlthough there has been a more pronounced history of resistance to Islamization in East Java, Hindu communities are also expanding in Central Java (Lyon 1980), for example in [[Klaten]], near the ancient Hindu monuments of [[Prambanan]]. Today the Prambanan temple stages various annual Hindu ceremonies and festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.\n\nIn [[West Java]], a Hindu temple [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]] was built on the slope of [[Mount Salak]] near the historic site of ancient [[Sunda Kingdom]] capital, [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] in modern [[Bogor]]. The temple, dubbed as the largest Balinese Hindu temple ever built outside Bali, was meant as the main temple for the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] Hindu population in the [[Greater Jakarta]] region. However, because the temple stands in a Sundanese sacred place, and also hosts a shrine dedicated to the famous Sundanese king, [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]], the site has gain popularity among [[Sundanese people|locals]] who wish to reconnect their ties with the ancestors.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Odalan procession.JPG|thumb|right|Colourful and festive Hindu rituals of Bali is one of island's attraction]]\nThe predominantly Hindu island of Bali is the largest tourist draw in Indonesia.<ref>[http://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/foreign-tourist-arrivals-to-indonesia-jump-22.6-in-january-2014/item1716 Foreign Tourist Arrivals to Indonesia Jump 22.6% in January 2014]</ref> Next to natural beauty, the temple architecture, the elaborate Hindu festivals, rich culture, colorful art and vivid dances are the main attractions of Balinese [[Tourism in Indonesia|tourism]]. As a result, tourism and hospitality services are flourishing as one of the most important sources of income and generation of Balinese economy. The high tourist activity in Bali is in contrast with other provinces in Indonesia where the Hindu population is not significant or is absent.\n\n==Symbolism==\nThe National emblem of Indonesia is called [[Garuda Pancasila]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/symbol-and-the-state/state-emblem.html |title=State Emblem |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Indonesia.go.id |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref> [[Garuda]], the discipled carrier or vehicle ([[vahana]]) of Lord [[Vishnu]], appears in many ancient [[Hindu]] temples of ancient Indonesia.

Nonetheless, some areas of traditional Democratic strength such as [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]], where [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] is located, saw swings in margins of up to 25% toward Donald Trump, making him the first Republican candidate for president to carry Pennsylvania since [[George H.

election in Pennsylvania''' took place on November 8, 2016, as part of the [[2016 United States elections]] in which all 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] participated. [[Pennsylvania]] voters chose electors to represent them in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] via a popular vote.\n\nOn April 26, 2016, in the [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]], voters selected the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and [[Green Party of the United States|Green]] parties' respective nominees for president. Pennsylvania is a [[Primary election|closed primary]] state, meaning voters must have been previously registered with a particular political party in order to vote for one of that parties' candidates, to participate in their respective party primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votespa.com/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=1173919&parentname=ObjMgr&parentid=1&mode=2 |title=About Voting and Elections |publisher=Votespa.com |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2016-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Republican party candidate was businessman and former host of The Apprentice (an American reality television program), [[Donald Trump]], who won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes out of more than 6,000,000 cast, a difference of 0.72% and the narrowest margin in a presidential election for the state in 176 years, [[1840 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania|since 1840]] when [[William Henry Harrison]] defeated [[Martin Van Buren]] by just 0.12%.\n\nPrior to the election, Pennsylvania was expected to be close as polling showed the results within the margin of error. However, most election experts viewed Pennsylvania as solidly Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5964.html |title=Pennsylvania: Trump vs. Clinton vs. Johnson vs. Stein |publisher=realclearpolitics.com |date=2016-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/upshot/clinton-has-solid-lead-in-electoral-college-trumps-winning-map-is-unclear.html |title=Clinton Has Solid Lead in Electoral College; Trump's Winning Map Is Unclear |date=2016-11-06 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-10-30 |language=en |quote=The final nonpartisan live interview polls there show Mrs. Clinton ahead by a comfortable margin of four to six points.

Trump carried 56 of the state's 67 counties, predominantly rural or semi-rural counties, while Clinton carried much of the [[Philadelphia]] metropolitan area as well as other cities including [[Pittsburgh]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. Nonetheless, some areas of traditional Democratic strength such as [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]], where [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] is located, saw swings in margins of up to 25% toward Donald Trump, making him the first Republican candidate for president to carry Pennsylvania since [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania|1988]]. 2016 would also be the first presidential election in which Pennsylvania voted to the right of the nation since [[1948 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania|1948]].

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the [[Government of United Kingdom|British Government]] decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.{{sfn|Allport|2015|p=323}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Perry|1988|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Simkins|2007|pp=43\u201346}}\n\nThe composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses.

To avoid war, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] met with German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in September and brokered the [[Munich Agreement]]. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to [[Annexation|annex]] the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275}} Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=277\u2013278}} On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|the remnants of the Czech state]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=281}}\n\nOn 29 March, Secretary of State for War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}} The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=47}} In April, limited [[conscription]] was introduced.

The TA would join regular army divisions completed their training, with the final divisions of the entire force deployed one year after the war began.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=455, 507, 514\u2013515}} A mixture of First and Second Line formations were deployed for combat overseas.

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears.

Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total.

This can be completed at either a UOTC over a number of weekends, or over 2 weeks at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] (RMAS)\n\n'''Module B''' covers training in Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation, both in theory and in practice, with a focus on the section battle drills and the platoon combat estimate. This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module C''' builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module D''' Once the Officer Cadet has completed their ArmyOfficer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.\n\nOn successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their [[Commission (document)|Commission]] and become [[Second Lieutenant]]s. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] includes:\n\n'''Post Commissioning Training''' (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.\n\n'''Special To Arm training''' is specific to the type of unit the [[Subaltern]] is joining, and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander's]] Battle Course held at the [[Infantry Battle School]] in [[Brecon]] which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the [[Light Cavalry]] Commander's Course held at the Reconnaissance & Armoured Tactics Division in [[Warminster]] which is run separately to Regular training courses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[List of Territorial Army units (2012)]]\n*[[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]\n*[[Auxiliary Units]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[Exercise Cambrian Patrol]]\n*[[Home Service Force]] (1982\u20131993)\n*[[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n*[[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]\n*[[Royal Marines Reserve]]\n*[[Royal Naval Reserve]]\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n*[[Territorial Decoration]]\n*[[The Territorial Army (British Rail)]]\n*[[Volunteer Reserves Service Medal]]\n*[[Australian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Primary Reserve#Army Reserve|Canadian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Army Reserve (Ireland)|Irish Army Reserve]]\n*[[Indian Territorial Army]]\n*[[New Zealand Army#Army Reserve|Territorial Force]]\n*[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]]\n{{col break|gap=4em}}\n'''People'''\n*[[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson]]\n*[[Micky Burn]]\n*[[Billy Connolly]]\n*[[Bill Deedes]]\n*[[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]]\n*[[Bear Grylls]]\n*[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]\n*[[Paddy Mayne]]\n*[[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Alan |last=Allport |author1-link=Alan Allport |title=Browned Off and Bloody-minded: The British Soldier Goes to War 1939\u20131945 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-17075-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*Beckett, Ian F.

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the [[Government of United Kingdom|British Government]] decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.{{sfn|Allport|2015|p=323}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Perry|1988|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Simkins|2007|pp=43\u201346}}\n\nThe composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses. The remaining yeomanry were converted to artillery or armoured car units or disbanded.<ref>New Territorial Army \u2013 The Government Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref><ref>New Citizen Army \u2013 2nd Line Defence Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref> The amalgamation of 40 pairs of infantry battalions was announced in October 1921.<ref>Territorial Army Reduction, ''The Times'', July 15, 1921</ref><ref>Territorial Army Amalgamations \u2013 40 Battalions Affected ''The Times'', October 5, 1921</ref> As part of the post-war \"[[Geddes Axe]]\" financial cuts, the TA was further reduced in size in 1922: artillery batteries lost two of their six guns, the established size of infantry battalions was cut and ancillary medical, veterinary, signals and [[Royal Army Service Corps]] units were either reduced in size or abolished.<ref>Territorial Army Reductions \u2013 \u00a31,650,000 to be saved, ''The Times'', March 4, 1922</ref> The bounty was also reduced to \u00a33 for trained men and \u00a32.10s 0d for recruits, which resulted in finding \u00a31,175,000 of the total savings required from the army as a whole.<ref>Ian F.

To avoid war, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] met with German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in September and brokered the [[Munich Agreement]]. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to [[Annexation|annex]] the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275}} Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=277\u2013278}} On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|the remnants of the Czech state]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=281}}\n\nOn 29 March, Secretary of State for War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}} The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=47}} In April, limited [[conscription]] was introduced. This resulted in 34,500 twenty-year-old militiamen being conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before deployment to the forming second-line units.{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=64}} It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months.

The TA's war deployment plan envisioned the divisions being deployed, as equipment became available, in waves to reinforce the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions completed their training, with the final divisions of the entire force deployed one year after the war began.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=455, 507, 514\u2013515}} A mixture of First and Second Line formations were deployed for combat overseas.

On 20 July 1960, a reorganisation of the TA was announced in the House of Commons. The territorials were to be reduced from 266 fighting units to 195. There was to be a reduction of 46 regiments of the Royal Artillery, 18 battalions of infantry, 12 regiments of the Royal Engineers and two regiments of the Royal Corps of Signals.<ref>''Reorganizing Territorials'', the Times, July 21, 1960</ref> The reductions were carried out in 1961, mainly by amalgamating units.

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears. An increase in the size of the TAVR in 1971 led to the formation of a number of battalions based on these cadres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |title=Regiments of the British TERRITORIAL & ARMY VOLUNTEER RESERVE 1967 at regiments.org by T.F.Mills |accessdate=2015-02-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ Lineage of British Army Regiments 1967 \u2013 2000 by Wienand Drieth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331142241/http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ |date=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the Territorial Army title was restored and, in the following years, its size was somewhat increased, with the regimental system being progressively reinstated. Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total. The annual budget of the Army Reserve is approximately \u00a3350 million \u2013 around 1.3% of the total [[List of countries and federations by military expenditures|defence budget]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0070.html|title=British Army \u2013 Reserve Forces \u2013 Types of Reservist and Manpower Strength \u2013 Armed Forces \u2013 a11a3|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2011 onwards and renaming===\n[[File:Army Reservists Applying Camouflage MOD 45156159.jpg|thumb|Army Reservists applying camouflage during a training exercise]]\nUnder the \"Future Reserves 2020\" (FR20) plan outlined by then Secretary of State for Defence [[Liam Fox]] on 18 July 2011, the Ministry of Defence promised to provide more money to train more Army Reservists with the objective of more frequently deploying entire Army Reserve units{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (much like [[United States Army Reserve]] and [[Army National Guard]] units). Under the reform plan, the total force will be restructured so that, by 2020, the British Army will have 120,000 soldiers, of which 84,000 will be Regulars and 35,000 Reservists (a ratio of 70/30).

This is normally conducted by the Arm or Service that the recruit is joining, for example for infantry units, Phase 2 consists of the two-week Combat Infantryman's Course (TA) (CIC (TA)) held at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]].<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence\"/>\n\n===Officers===\n\nTo gain a commission, Potential Officers have to pass through four modules of training, which together form the Army Reserve Commissioning Course.\n\n'''Module A''' consists of basic field training and elementary military skills. This can be completed at either a UOTC over a number of weekends, or over 2 weeks at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] (RMAS)\n\n'''Module B''' covers training in Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation, both in theory and in practice, with a focus on the section battle drills and the platoon combat estimate. This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module C''' builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module D''' Once the Officer Cadet has completed their ArmyOfficer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.\n\nOn successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their [[Commission (document)|Commission]] and become [[Second Lieutenant]]s. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] includes:\n\n'''Post Commissioning Training''' (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.\n\n'''Special To Arm training''' is specific to the type of unit the [[Subaltern]] is joining, and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander's]] Battle Course held at the [[Infantry Battle School]] in [[Brecon]] which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the [[Light Cavalry]] Commander's Course held at the Reconnaissance & Armoured Tactics Division in [[Warminster]] which is run separately to Regular training courses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[List of Territorial Army units (2012)]]\n*[[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]\n*[[Auxiliary Units]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[Exercise Cambrian Patrol]]\n*[[Home Service Force]] (1982\u20131993)\n*[[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n*[[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]\n*[[Royal Marines Reserve]]\n*[[Royal Naval Reserve]]\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n*[[Territorial Decoration]]\n*[[The Territorial Army (British Rail)]]\n*[[Volunteer Reserves Service Medal]]\n*[[Australian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Primary Reserve#Army Reserve|Canadian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Army Reserve (Ireland)|Irish Army Reserve]]\n*[[Indian Territorial Army]]\n*[[New Zealand Army#Army Reserve|Territorial Force]]\n*[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]]\n{{col break|gap=4em}}\n'''People'''\n*[[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson]]\n*[[Micky Burn]]\n*[[Billy Connolly]]\n*[[Bill Deedes]]\n*[[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]]\n*[[Bear Grylls]]\n*[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]\n*[[Paddy Mayne]]\n*[[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Alan |last=Allport |author1-link=Alan Allport |title=Browned Off and Bloody-minded: The British Soldier Goes to War 1939\u20131945 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-17075-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*Beckett, Ian F.
