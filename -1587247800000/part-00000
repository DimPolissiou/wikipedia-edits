Sanyal diagnoses the hero, [[Basanta Choudhury]], as having an unresolved Oedipal dilemma. He orders Radha to play the role though she is hesitant as in a similar case she had fallen in love with the patient. She finally agrees and bears up to Choudhury's violence, impersonates his mother, sings his poetic compositions and in the process falls in love again. In the end, even as she brings about his cure, she suffers a nervous breakdown.

The statue widens progressively down the drapery of Mary's dress, to the base, the rock of [[Golgotha]]. The figures are quite out of proportion, owing to the difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled full-length in a woman's lap. Much of Mary's body is concealed by her monumental drapery, and the relationship of the figures appears quite natural. Michelangelo's interpretation of the ''Piet\u00e0'' was far different from those previously created by other artists, as he sculpted a young and beautiful Mary rather than an older woman around 50 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voxmundi.eu/vatican-pieta-by-michelangelo-buonarroti/|title=Everything you need to know about Michelangelo Buonarroti's Piet\u00e0|date=2017-04-14|website=Official tourist service for Saint Peter's Basilica|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe marks of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound in Jesus' side.\n\nChrist's face does not reveal signs of [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]].

Various explanations have been suggested for this. One is that her youth symbolizes her incorruptible purity, as Michelangelo himself said to his biographer and fellow sculptor [[Ascanio Condivi]].\n{{Quote|Do you not know that chaste women stay fresh much more than those who are not chaste? How much more in the case of the Virgin, who had never experienced the least lascivious desire that might change her body?<ref>{{cite book|last=Pope-Hennessy|first=John|title=An Introduction to Italian Sculpture: Italian High Renaissance and Baroque sculpture|year=1970|publisher=Phaidon|page=304|edition=3|authorlink=John Pope-Hennessy}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother explanation suggests that Michelangelo's treatment of the subject was influenced by his passion for [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]'': so well-acquainted was he with the work that when he went to [[Bologna]], he paid for hospitality by reciting verses from it. In ''Paradiso'' ([[cantica]] 33 of the poem), [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], in a prayer for the Virgin Mary, says \"''Vergine madre, figlia del tuo figlio''\" (Virgin mother, daughter of your son). This is said because, since Christ is one of the three figures of Trinity, Mary would be his daughter, but it is also she who bore him.\n\n==History after completion==\nFollowing completion, the ''Piet\u00e0'''s first home was the Chapel of Santa Petronilla, a Roman mausoleum near the south transept of St. Peter's, which the Cardinal chose as his funerary chapel. The [[chapel]] was later demolished by [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] during his rebuilding of the basilica. According to [[Giorgio Vasari]], shortly after the installation of his ''Piet\u00e0'', Michelangelo overheard someone remark (or asked visitors about the sculptor) that it was the work of another sculptor, [[Cristoforo Solari]], whereupon Michelangelo signed the sculpture.<ref>William E.

The statue was commissioned for the French [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jean de Bilh\u00e8res]], who was a representative in Rome.

The statue widens progressively down the drapery of Mary's dress, to the base, the rock of [[Golgotha]]. The figures are quite out of proportion, owing to the difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled full-length in a woman's lap. Much of Mary's body is concealed by her monumental drapery, and the relationship of the figures appears quite natural. Michelangelo's interpretation of the ''Piet\u00e0'' was far different from those previously created by other artists, as he sculpted a young and beautiful Mary rather than an older woman around 50 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voxmundi.eu/vatican-pieta-by-michelangelo-buonarroti/|title=Everything you need to know about Michelangelo Buonarroti's Piet\u00e0|date=2017-04-14|website=Official tourist service for Saint Peter's Basilica|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe marks of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound in Jesus' side.\n\nChrist's face does not reveal signs of [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]].

Various explanations have been suggested for this. One is that her youth symbolizes her incorruptible purity, as Michelangelo himself said to his biographer and fellow sculptor [[Ascanio Condivi]].\n{{Quote|Do you not know that chaste women stay fresh much more than those who are not chaste? How much more in the case of the Virgin, who had never experienced the least lascivious desire that might change her body?<ref>{{cite book|last=Pope-Hennessy|first=John|title=An Introduction to Italian Sculpture: Italian High Renaissance and Baroque sculpture|year=1970|publisher=Phaidon|page=304|edition=3|authorlink=John Pope-Hennessy}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother explanation suggests that Michelangelo's treatment of the subject was influenced by his passion for [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]'': so well-acquainted was he with the work that when he went to [[Bologna]], he paid for hospitality by reciting verses from it. In ''Paradiso'' ([[cantica]] 33 of the poem), [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], in a prayer for the Virgin Mary, says \"''Vergine madre, figlia del tuo figlio''\" (Virgin mother, daughter of your son). This is said because, since Christ is one of the three figures of Trinity, Mary would be his daughter, but it is also she who bore him.\n\n==History after completion==\nFollowing completion, the ''Piet\u00e0'''s first home was the Chapel of Santa Petronilla, a Roman mausoleum near the south transept of St. Peter's, which the Cardinal chose as his funerary chapel. The [[chapel]] was later demolished by [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] during his rebuilding of the basilica. According to [[Giorgio Vasari]], shortly after the installation of his ''Piet\u00e0'', Michelangelo overheard someone remark (or asked visitors about the sculptor) that it was the work of another sculptor, [[Cristoforo Solari]], whereupon Michelangelo signed the sculpture.<ref>William E.

This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of the four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Riaz|year=2015|title=The Location of Ptolemy's Stone Tower: the Case for Sulaiman-Too in Osh|url=|journal=The Silk Road|volume=13|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMany centuries later Tashkurgan became the capital of the Sarikol kingdom ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8272\u52d2\u5e93\u5c14}}), a kingdom of the [[Pamir Mountains]], and later of '''Qiepantuo''' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6705\u76d8\u9640}}) under the [[Persian Empire]]. At the northeast corner of the town is a huge fortress known as the Princess Castle dating from the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368 CE) and the subject of many colourful local legends. A ruined [[fire temple]] is near the fortress.\n\nThe Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] passed through Tashkurgan around 649 CE, on his way to Khotan from Badakhshan, as did [[Song Yun]] around 500 CE. When [[Aurel Stein]] passed through the town in the early twentieth century he was pleased to find that Tashkurgan matched the descriptions left by those travellers: discussing Qiepantuo, Xuanzang recorded (in [[Samuel Beal]]'s translation), \"This country is about 200 li in circuit; the capital rests on a great rocky crag of the mountain, and is backed by the river \u015ait\u00e2.

She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of [[Xuanzang]]'s visit.

When [[Aurel Stein]] passed through the town in the early twentieth century he was pleased to find that Tashkurgan matched the descriptions left by those travellers: discussing Qiepantuo, Xuanzang recorded (in [[Samuel Beal]]'s translation), \"This country is about 200 li in circuit; the capital rests on a great rocky crag of the mountain, and is backed by the river \u015ait\u00e2.

She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of [[Xuanzang]]'s visit. Stein records a version of this, current at the time of his visit, in which the princess is the daughter of the Persian king Naush\u012brv\u0101n.<ref>{{cite book|last=Xuanzang|title=Si-Yu-Ki.

They are labelled as dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Warring States period]] (475\u2212221 BCE). The mummies were discovered in the nearby Xiabandi Valley on the old caravan route to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]].

Tashkurgan is a market town for sheep, wool and woollen goods, particularly carpets, and is surrounded by orchards. The majority population in the town are ethnic [[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Mountain Tajiks]]. The majority of people in the region speak [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]]. There is also a village of [[Wakhi language|Wakhi speakers]]. [[Standard Chinese]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are also spoken.\n\nThe [[Tashkurgan River]] begins just north of the [[Khunjerab Pass]] and flows north along the [[Karakoram Highway]] to Tashkurgan.  Just north of Tashkurgan it turns east and flows through a gorge to the [[Tarim Basin]] where it joins the [[Yarkand River]].\n\n===Climate===\nTashkurgan has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BWk''), influenced by the high elevation, with long, very cold winters, and warm summers.

Otlet created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], one of the most prominent examples of [[faceted classification]]. Otlet was responsible for the widespread adoption in Europe of the standard American 3x5&nbsp;inch [[index card]] used until recently in most library catalogs around the world (by now largely displaced by the advent of the [[OPAC|online public access catalog]] (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the ''{{lang|fr|[[Trait\u00e9 de Documentation]]}}'' (1934) and ''{{lang|fr|Monde: Essai d'universalisme}}'' (1935).<ref>Michael Buckland, [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/otlet.html Paul Otlet, Pioneer of Information Management], biography of Paul Otlet for the School of Information at UC Berkeley, n.d.</ref><ref>Alex Wright, [http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet Forgotten Forefather, Paul Otlet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603161002/http://boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet |date=3 June 2012 }}, Boxes and Arrows, Nov. 10, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and [[Henri La Fontaine]] created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the [[Union of International Associations]] in 1910, and which is still located in [[Brussels]]. They also created a great international center called at first {{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}} (World Palace), later, the [[Mundaneum]] to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes.\n\nOtlet and La Fontaine were [[peace activist]]s who endorsed the internationalist politics of the [[League of Nations]] and its [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]] (the forerunner of [[UNESCO]]). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization an emerging global [[polity]], and wished to help solidify it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1913.\n\n== Early life and career ==\nOtlet was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 23 August 1868, the oldest child of \u00c9douard Otlet (Brussels 13 June 1842-[[Blanquefort, Gironde|Blanquefort]], [[France]], 20 October 1907) and Maria (n\u00e9e Van Mons). His father, \u00c9douard, was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune selling [[tram]]s around the world. His mother died in 1871 at the age of 24, when Otlet was three. Through his mother, he was related to the ''Van Mons'' family, a prosperous family, and to the Verhaeren family, of which [[Emile Verhaeren]] was one of the most important Belgian poets.\n\nHis father kept him out of school, hiring tutors instead, until he was 11, believing that classrooms were a stifling environment. Otlet, as a child, had few friends, and played regularly only with his younger brother Maurice. He soon developed a love of reading and books.\n\nAt the age of six, a temporary decline in his father's wealth caused the family to move to Paris. At the age of 11, Paul went to school for the first time, a [[Jesuit]] school in [[Paris]], where he stayed for the next three years. The family then returned to Brussels, and Paul studied at the prestigious [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Michel]]<ref>Alain Deneef and Xavier Rousseaux (eds.), ''Quatre si\u00e8cles de pr\u00e9sence j\u00e9suite \u00e0 Bruxelles'', Kadoc, no. 58, Louvain, 2012. {{ISBN|9782930682006}}.</ref> in Brussels. In 1894, his father became a [[senator]] in the [[Belgian Senate]] for the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] (until 1900). His father remarried to Valerie Linden, daughter of famed botanist [[Jean Jules Linden]]; the two eventually had five additional children. The family travelled often during this time, going on holidays and business trips to [[Italy]], France and [[Russia]].\n\nOtlet was educated at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and at the {{lang|fr|[[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]}}, where he earned a law degree on 15 July 1890. He married his step-cousin, Fernande Gloner, soon afterward, on 9 December 1890. He then clerked with famed lawyer [[Edmond Picard]], a friend of his father's.\n\nOtlet soon became dissatisfied with his legal career, and began to take an interest in [[bibliography]]. His first published work on the subject was the essay \"Something about bibliography\", written in 1892. In it he expressed the belief that books were an inadequate way to store information, because the arrangement of facts contained within them was an arbitrary decision on the part of the author, making individual facts difficult to locate. A better storage system, Otlet wrote in his essay, would be cards containing individual \"chunks\" of information, that would allow \"all the manipulations of classification and continuous interfiling.\" In addition would be needed \"a very detailed synoptic outline of knowledge\" that could allow classification of all of these chunks of data.\n\nIn 1891, Otlet met [[Henri La Fontaine]], a fellow lawyer with shared interests in bibliography and international relations, and the two became good friends. They were commissioned in 1892 by Belgium's Societ\u00e9 des Sciences sociales et politiques (Society of social and political sciences) to create bibliographies for various of the social sciences; they spent three years doing this. In 1895, they discovered the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], a library classification system that had been invented in 1876. They decided to try to expand this system to cover the classification of facts that Otlet had previously imagined. They wrote to the system's creator, [[Melvil Dewey]], asking for permission to modify his system in this way; he agreed, so long as their system was not translated into English. They began work on this expansion soon afterwards and thus created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]].\n\nDuring this time, Otlet and his wife then had two sons, Marcel and Jean, in quick succession.\n\nOtlet founded the {{lang|fr|Institut International de Bibliographie}} (IIB) in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the [[International Federation for Information and Documentation]] (FID).\n\n== The Universal Bibliographic Repertory ==\n[[File:Mundaneum Tir\u00e4ng Karteikaarten.jpg|thumb|R\u00e9pertoire Bibliographique Universel]]\nIn 1895, Otlet and La Fontaine also began the creation of a collection of index cards, meant to catalog facts, that came to be known as the \"{{lang|fr|Repertoire Bibliographique Universel}}\" (RBU), or the \"Universal Bibliographic Repertory\". By the end of 1895 it had grown to 400,000 entries; later it would reach more than 15 million entries.\n\nIn 1896, Otlet set up a fee-based service to answer questions by mail, by sending the requesters copies of the relevant index cards for each query; scholar Charles van den Heuvel has referred to the service as an \"analog [[search engine]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Cataloguing the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age (in Introduction)|first= Alex |last=Wright|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2014}}</ref> By 1912, this service responded to over 1,500 queries a year. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.\n\nOtlet envisioned a copy of the RBU in each major city around the world, with Brussels holding the master copy. At various times between 1900 and 1914, attempts were made to send full copies of the RBU to cities such as Paris, [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]; however, difficulties in copying and transportation meant that no city received more than a few hundred thousand cards.\n\n== The Universal Decimal Classification ==\nIn 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine began to publish their classification scheme, which they termed the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. The UDC was originally based on Melvil Dewey's Decimal classification system. Otlet and La Fontaine contacted Melvil Dewey to inquire if they could modify the Dewey Decimal System to suit the perimeters of their bibliographic project, namely, organizing information in the social and natural sciences.  Dewey granted them permission as long as it substantially differed from his original version. <ref>Rayward, W. 1. (1997). The origins of information science and the International Institute of Bibliography/International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). ''Journal Of The American Society For Information Science, 48'', 289-300.</ref> They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with [[Herbert Haviland Field]] at the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]] for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, but also an algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation <nowiki>\"31:[622+669](485)\"</nowiki> refers to the [[statistics]] of [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] in [[Sweden]]. The UDC is an example of an analytico-synthetic classification, i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the [[BBC Archives]].\n\n== Personal difficulties and World War I ==\nIn 1906, with his father \u00c9douard near death and his businesses falling apart, Paul and his brother and five step-siblings formed a company, {{lang|fr|Otlet Fr\u00e8res}} (\"Otlet Brothers\") to try to manage these businesses, which included mines and railways. Paul, though he was consumed with his bibliographic work, became president of the company. In 1907, \u00c9douard died, and the family struggled to maintain all parts of the business. In April 1908, Paul Otlet and his wife began divorce proceedings. Otlet remarried in 1912, to Cato Van Nederhesselt.\n\nIn 1913, La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and invested his winnings into Otlet and La Fontaine's bibliographic ventures, which were suffering from lack of funding. Otlet journeyed to the [[United States]] in early 1914 to try to get additional funding from the U.S. Government, but his efforts soon came to a halt due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Otlet returned to Belgium, but quickly fled after it became occupied by the Germans; he spent the majority of the war in Paris and various cities in [[Switzerland]]. Both his sons fought in the Belgian army, and one of them, Jean, died during the war in the [[Battle of the Yser]].\n\nOtlet spent much of the war trying to bring about peace, and the creation of multinational institutions that he felt could avert future wars. In 1914, he published a book, \"{{lang|fr|La Fin de la Guerre}}\" (\"The End of War\") that defined a \"World Charter of Human Rights\" as the basis for an international federation.\n\n== The Mundaneum ==\n{{main|Mundaneum}}\n\nIn 1910, Otlet and La Fontaine first envisioned a \"city of knowledge\", which Otlet originally named the \"{{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}}\" (\"World Palace\"), that would serve as a central repository for the world's information. In 1919, soon after the end of World War I, they convinced the government of Belgium to give them the space and funding for this project, arguing that it would help Belgium bolster its bid to house the [[League of Nations]] headquarters. They were given space in the left wing of the {{lang|fr|[[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]]}}, a government building in [[Brussels]]. They then hired staff to help add to their Universal Bibliographic Repertory. \n\nIn 1921 Otlet wrote to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] offering the use of the Palais Mondial for the [[Pan-African_Congress#2nd_Pan-African_Congress|2nd Pan-African Congress]]. Although both Otlet and Fontaine offered a warm welcome to the Congress, these sentiments were not shared across all of Belgian society. The Brussels based paper ''Neptune'' stated that the organisers \u2013 particularly the [[National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]] were funded by the [[Bolsheviks]] and raised concern that it might lead to difficulties in the [[Belgian Congo]] by drawing together \"all the ne\u2019er-do-wells of the various tribes of the Colony, aside from some hundreds of labourers.\u201d<ref name=\"Colonial and Coloured Unity\">{{cite book |last1=Padmore |first1=George |title=Colonial and Coloured Unity: A Programme of Action; History of the Pan-African Congress, edited by George Padmore 1947 |date=1947 |publisher=The Hammersmith Bookshop |location=London |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/padmore/1947/pan-african-congress/ch05.htm |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Palais Mondial was briefly shuttered in 1922, due to lack of support from the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Theunis]], but was reopened after lobbying from Otlet and La Fontaine. Otlet renamed the Palais Mondial to the Mundaneum in 1924. The RBU steadily grew to 13 million index cards in 1927;  by its final year, 1934, it had reached more than 15 million.<ref name=\"xanadu\">[[W. Boyd Rayward]] [http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm \"Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868-1944) and Hypertext.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227184732/http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm |date=27 December 2005 }}, ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 4(4):235-250.  May 1994.</ref> Index cards were stored in custom-designed cabinets, and indexed according to the Universal Decimal Classification. The collection also grew to include files (including letters, reports, newspaper articles, etc.) and images, contained in separate rooms; the index cards were meant to catalog all of these as well. The Mundaneum eventually contained 100,000 files and millions of images.\n\nIn 1934, the Belgian government again cut off funding for the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when [[Germany]] invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of [[Third Reich]] art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues to find a new home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]] they reconstituted the Mundaneum as best as they could, and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death.\n\n== The World City ==\nThe World City or Cit\u00e9 Mondiale is a utopian vision by Paul Otlet of a city which like a universal exhibition brings together all the leading institutions of the world.<ref>In 2011 [http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ Wouter Van Acker] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717155012/http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ |date=17 July 2012 }} completed  his PhD on the visionary schemes and schemas of Paul Otlet.</ref> The World City would radiate knowledge to the rest of the world and construct peace and universal cooperation. Otlet\u2019s idea to design a utopian city dedicated to international institutions was largely inspired by the contemporary publication in 1913 by the Norwegian-American sculptor [[Hendrik Christian Andersen]] and the French architect [[Ernest H\u00e9brard]] of an impressive series of Beaux-Arts plans for a World Centre of Communication (1913). For the design of his World City, Otlet collaborated with several architects. In this way a whole series of designs for the World City was developed. The most elaborated plans were: the design of a Mundaneum (1928) and a World City (1929) by [[Le Corbusier]] in Geneva next to the palace of the League of Nations, by Victor Bourgeois in Tervuren (1931) next to the Congo Museum, again by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Huib Hoste) on the left bank in Antwerp (1933), by Maurice Heymans in Chesapeake Bay near Washington (1935), and by Stanislas Jassinski and Rapha\u00ebl Delville on the left bank in Antwerp (1941). In these different designs the program of the World City stayed more or less fixed, containing a World Museum, a World University, a World Library and Documentation Centre, Offices for the International Associations, Offices or Embassies for the Nations, an Olympic Centre, a residential area, and a park.\n\n== Exploring new media ==\nOtlet integrated new media, as they were invented, into his vision of the networked knowledge-base of the future. In the early 1900s, Otlet worked with engineer [[Robert Goldschmidt]] on storing bibliographic data on [[microfilm]] (then known as \"micro-photography\"). These experiments continued into the 1920s, and by the late 1920s he attempted along with colleagues to create an encyclopedia printed entirely on microfilm, known as the ''{{lang|la|Encyclopaedia Microphotica Mundaneum}}'', which was housed in the Mundaneum. In the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote about radio and television as other forms of conveying information, writing in the 1934 ''{{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 de documentation}}'' that \"one after another, marvellous inventions have immensely extended the possibilities of documentation.\" In the same book, he predicted that media that would convey feel, taste and smell would also eventually be invented, and that an ideal information-conveyance system should be able to handle all of what he called \"sense-perception documents\".\n\n==Political views and involvement==\n\nOtlet was a firm believer in international cooperation to promote both the spread of knowledge and peace between nations. A self-identified liberal, [[Universalism|universalist]] and pacifist, his endeavor to catalog and classify is an expression of the commitment to the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] project to structure knowledge according to universal categories and taxonomies, of which the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] is an example.<ref name=\"Omission and validation\"> {{cite document |last1=Mugrefya |first1=Elodie |title=Omission and validation |date=2019 |publisher=Constant |location=Brussels }}</ref> The Union of International Associations, which he had founded in 1907 with Henri La Fontaine, later participated to the development of both the [[League of Nations]] and the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which was later merged into [[UNESCO]].\n\nAt several occasions, Otlet published racist statements dressed up as scientific facts, starting at the beginning of his career with ''L'Afrique Aux Noirs'' (1888)<ref name=\"\u2018L\u2019Afrique Aux Noirs\">{{cite book |last1=Otlet |first1=Paul |title=L\u2019Afrique Aux Noirs |date=1888 |publisher=Ferdinand Larcier |location=Brussels |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58828/58828-h/58828-h.htm |accessdate=}}</ref> where he argued that white people or 'westernized' blacks were to be tasked with [[Civilizing mission|'civilising']] Africa. Similarly, in ''Monde'' (1935) <ref name=\"\u2018Monde\">{{cite document |last1=Otlet |first1=Paul |title=Monde|date=1888 |publisher=Editions Mundaneum |location=Brussels |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Fichier:Otlet_-_Monde_-_1935.djvu |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>, near the end of his life, he claimed the biological superiority of white people. His interest in advancing \u2018The African Issue\u2019 was fuelled by a firm conviction of the superiority of European culture and intelligence which fitted the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project that he was dedicated to.<ref name=\"omissum\">{{cite document |author1=Mondotheque |author2=Algolit |title=Paul Otlet, an Omissum |date=2020 |publisher=Constant |location=Brussels |url=https://diversions.constantvzw.org/paul-otlet-an-omissum.html |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Otlet\u2019s organisational support to the 1921 [[Pan-African Congress]] at the ''Palais Mondial'' (later: [[Mundaneum]]) therefore needs to be considered in connection with the racist statements that he published both before and after the event.\n\nIn 1933, Otlet proposed building in Belgium near [[Antwerp]] a \"gigantic neutral [[World City]]\" to employ a massive number of workers, in order to alleviate the unemployment generated by the [[Great Depression]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744944-1,00.html Work for All the World], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 23 January 1933</ref>\n\n== Fade into obscurity ==\nOtlet died in 1944, not long before the end of World War II, having seen his major project, the Mundaneum, shuttered, and having lost all his funding sources. According to Otlet scholar [[W. Boyd Rayward]]:\n\n: \"The First World War marked the end of the intellectual as well as sociopolitical era in which Otlet had functioned hitherto with remarkable success. After the war, he and his schemes were never taken seriously except with the circle of his disciples. He quickly lost the support of the Belgian government. In the late 1920s he faced the defection of his followers in the International Institute of Documentation, as the International Institute of Bibliography \" <ref>W. Boyd Rayward, \"Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868\u20131944) and Hypertext\", ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 4(4), May 1994, p. 284.</ref>\n\nAnd:\n\n: \"Perhaps at one level, Otlet, is best regarded as a fin de si\u00e8cle figure whose work enjoyed a considerable measure of acceptance and support at home and abroad before World War I. But after the War, it rapidly lost favour. Once influential nationally and internationally, at least in a relatively specialised circle, Otlet came to be regarded as difficult and obstructive as he grew old. His ideas and the extraordinary institutional arrangements in which they had finally come to be expressed, the Palais Mondial or Mundaneum, seemed grandiose, unfocused and pass\u00e9. In the early 1930s there was a quietly dramatic struggle to remove the International Institute of Bibliography, transformed eventually into the International Federation for Documentation, from this institutional complex and from under what was considered to be the dead hand of the past - effectively the hand of the still very much alive but ageing Otlet.\" <ref>W. Boyd Rayward,  \"Knowledge organisation and a new world polity:the rise and fall and rise of the ideas of Paul Otlet\", ''Transnational Associations'', no. 1-2 (2003), p. 4.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of [[World War II]], the contributions of Otlet to the field of information science were lost sight of in the rising popularity of the ideas of American information scientists such as [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Ted Nelson]] and by such theorists of information organization as [[Seymour Lubetzky]].\n\n== Rediscovery ==\nBeginning in the 1980s, and especially after the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s, new interest arose in Otlet's speculations and theories about the organization of knowledge, the use of information technologies, and globalization. His 1934 masterpiece, the ''Trait\u00e9 de documentation'', was reprinted in 1989 by the [[Centre de Lecture publique de la Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]] in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|title=Trait\u00e9 De Documentation (original manuscript)|format=PDF|website=archive.ugent.be|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607052400/https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|archivedate=7 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (Neither the Trait\u00e9 nor its companion work, \"Monde\" (World) has been translated into English so far.) In 1990 Professor W. Boyd Rayward published an English translation of some of Otlet's writings.<ref>{{cite document|title=International Organisation and Dissemination of Knowledge (original manuscript)|hdl = 2142/4004}}</ref> He also published a biography of Otlet (1975) that was translated into Russian (1976) and Spanish (1996, 1999, and 2005).\n\nIn 1985, Belgian academic [[Andr\u00e9 Canonne]] raised the possibility of recreating the Mundaneum as an archive and museum devoted to Otlet and others associated with them; his idea initially was to house it in the Belgian city of [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]. Cannone, with substantial help from others, eventually managed to open the new Mundaneum in  [[Mons]], Belgium in 1998.  This museum is still in operation, and contains the personal papers of Otlet and La Fontaine and the archives of the various organizations they created along with other collections important to the modern history of Belgium.\n\n== Analysis of Otlet's theories ==\n\nOtlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward has written that Otlet's thinking is a product of the 19th century and the philosophy of [[positivism]], which holds that, through careful study and the [[scientific method]], an objective view of the world can be gained. According to W.

Otlet created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], one of the most prominent examples of [[faceted classification]]. Otlet was responsible for the widespread adoption in Europe of the standard American 3x5&nbsp;inch [[index card]] used until recently in most library catalogs around the world (by now largely displaced by the advent of the [[OPAC|online public access catalog]] (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the ''{{lang|fr|[[Trait\u00e9 de Documentation]]}}'' (1934) and ''{{lang|fr|Monde: Essai d'universalisme}}'' (1935).<ref>Michael Buckland, [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/otlet.html Paul Otlet, Pioneer of Information Management], biography of Paul Otlet for the School of Information at UC Berkeley, n.d.</ref><ref>Alex Wright, [http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet Forgotten Forefather, Paul Otlet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603161002/http://boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet |date=3 June 2012 }}, Boxes and Arrows, Nov. 10, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and [[Henri La Fontaine]] created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the [[Union of International Associations]] in 1910, and which is still located in [[Brussels]]. They also created a great international center called at first {{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}} (World Palace), later, the [[Mundaneum]] to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes.\n\nOtlet and La Fontaine were [[peace activist]]s who endorsed the internationalist politics of the [[League of Nations]] and its [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]] (the forerunner of [[UNESCO]]). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization an emerging global [[polity]], and wished to help solidify it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1913.\n\n== Early life and career ==\nOtlet was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 23 August 1868, the oldest child of \u00c9douard Otlet (Brussels 13 June 1842-[[Blanquefort, Gironde|Blanquefort]], [[France]], 20 October 1907) and Maria (n\u00e9e Van Mons). His father, \u00c9douard, was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune selling [[tram]]s around the world. His mother died in 1871 at the age of 24, when Otlet was three. Through his mother, he was related to the ''Van Mons'' family, a prosperous family, and to the Verhaeren family, of which [[Emile Verhaeren]] was one of the most important Belgian poets.\n\nHis father kept him out of school, hiring tutors instead, until he was 11, believing that classrooms were a stifling environment. Otlet, as a child, had few friends, and played regularly only with his younger brother Maurice. He soon developed a love of reading and books.\n\nAt the age of six, a temporary decline in his father's wealth caused the family to move to Paris. At the age of 11, Paul went to school for the first time, a [[Jesuit]] school in [[Paris]], where he stayed for the next three years. The family then returned to Brussels, and Paul studied at the prestigious [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Michel]]<ref>Alain Deneef and Xavier Rousseaux (eds.), ''Quatre si\u00e8cles de pr\u00e9sence j\u00e9suite \u00e0 Bruxelles'', Kadoc, no. 58, Louvain, 2012. {{ISBN|9782930682006}}.</ref> in Brussels. In 1894, his father became a [[senator]] in the [[Belgian Senate]] for the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] (until 1900). His father remarried to Valerie Linden, daughter of famed botanist [[Jean Jules Linden]]; the two eventually had five additional children. The family travelled often during this time, going on holidays and business trips to [[Italy]], France and [[Russia]].\n\nOtlet was educated at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and at the {{lang|fr|[[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]}}, where he earned a law degree on 15 July 1890. He married his step-cousin, Fernande Gloner, soon afterward, on 9 December 1890. He then clerked with famed lawyer [[Edmond Picard]], a friend of his father's.\n\nOtlet soon became dissatisfied with his legal career, and began to take an interest in [[bibliography]]. His first published work on the subject was the essay \"Something about bibliography\", written in 1892. In it he expressed the belief that books were an inadequate way to store information, because the arrangement of facts contained within them was an arbitrary decision on the part of the author, making individual facts difficult to locate. A better storage system, Otlet wrote in his essay, would be cards containing individual \"chunks\" of information, that would allow \"all the manipulations of classification and continuous interfiling.\" In addition would be needed \"a very detailed synoptic outline of knowledge\" that could allow classification of all of these chunks of data.\n\nIn 1891, Otlet met [[Henri La Fontaine]], a fellow lawyer with shared interests in bibliography and international relations, and the two became good friends. They were commissioned in 1892 by Belgium's Societ\u00e9 des Sciences sociales et politiques (Society of social and political sciences) to create bibliographies for various of the social sciences; they spent three years doing this. In 1895, they discovered the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], a library classification system that had been invented in 1876. They decided to try to expand this system to cover the classification of facts that Otlet had previously imagined. They wrote to the system's creator, [[Melvil Dewey]], asking for permission to modify his system in this way; he agreed, so long as their system was not translated into English. They began work on this expansion soon afterwards and thus created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]].\n\nDuring this time, Otlet and his wife then had two sons, Marcel and Jean, in quick succession.\n\nOtlet founded the {{lang|fr|Institut International de Bibliographie}} (IIB) in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the [[International Federation for Information and Documentation]] (FID).\n\n== The Universal Bibliographic Repertory ==\n[[File:Mundaneum Tir\u00e4ng Karteikaarten.jpg|thumb|R\u00e9pertoire Bibliographique Universel]]\nIn 1895, Otlet and La Fontaine also began the creation of a collection of index cards, meant to catalog facts, that came to be known as the \"{{lang|fr|Repertoire Bibliographique Universel}}\" (RBU), or the \"Universal Bibliographic Repertory\". By the end of 1895 it had grown to 400,000 entries; later it would reach more than 15 million entries.\n\nIn 1896, Otlet set up a fee-based service to answer questions by mail, by sending the requesters copies of the relevant index cards for each query; scholar Charles van den Heuvel has referred to the service as an \"analog [[search engine]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Cataloguing the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age (in Introduction)|first= Alex |last=Wright|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2014}}</ref> By 1912, this service responded to over 1,500 queries a year. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.\n\nOtlet envisioned a copy of the RBU in each major city around the world, with Brussels holding the master copy. At various times between 1900 and 1914, attempts were made to send full copies of the RBU to cities such as Paris, [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]; however, difficulties in copying and transportation meant that no city received more than a few hundred thousand cards.\n\n== The Universal Decimal Classification ==\nIn 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine began to publish their classification scheme, which they termed the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. The UDC was originally based on Melvil Dewey's Decimal classification system. Otlet and La Fontaine contacted Melvil Dewey to inquire if they could modify the Dewey Decimal System to suit the perimeters of their bibliographic project, namely, organizing information in the social and natural sciences.  Dewey granted them permission as long as it substantially differed from his original version. <ref>Rayward, W. 1. (1997). The origins of information science and the International Institute of Bibliography/International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). ''Journal Of The American Society For Information Science, 48'', 289-300.</ref> They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with [[Herbert Haviland Field]] at the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]] for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, but also an algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation <nowiki>\"31:[622+669](485)\"</nowiki> refers to the [[statistics]] of [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] in [[Sweden]]. The UDC is an example of an analytico-synthetic classification, i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the [[BBC Archives]].\n\n== Personal difficulties and World War I ==\nIn 1906, with his father \u00c9douard near death and his businesses falling apart, Paul and his brother and five step-siblings formed a company, {{lang|fr|Otlet Fr\u00e8res}} (\"Otlet Brothers\") to try to manage these businesses, which included mines and railways. Paul, though he was consumed with his bibliographic work, became president of the company. In 1907, \u00c9douard died, and the family struggled to maintain all parts of the business. In April 1908, Paul Otlet and his wife began divorce proceedings. Otlet remarried in 1912, to Cato Van Nederhesselt.\n\nIn 1913, La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and invested his winnings into Otlet and La Fontaine's bibliographic ventures, which were suffering from lack of funding. Otlet journeyed to the [[United States]] in early 1914 to try to get additional funding from the U.S. Government, but his efforts soon came to a halt due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Otlet returned to Belgium, but quickly fled after it became occupied by the Germans; he spent the majority of the war in Paris and various cities in [[Switzerland]]. Both his sons fought in the Belgian army, and one of them, Jean, died during the war in the [[Battle of the Yser]].\n\nOtlet spent much of the war trying to bring about peace, and the creation of multinational institutions that he felt could avert future wars. In 1914, he published a book, \"{{lang|fr|La Fin de la Guerre}}\" (\"The End of War\") that defined a \"World Charter of Human Rights\" as the basis for an international federation.\n\n== The Mundaneum ==\n{{main|Mundaneum}}\n\nIn 1910, Otlet and La Fontaine first envisioned a \"city of knowledge\", which Otlet originally named the \"{{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}}\" (\"World Palace\"), that would serve as a central repository for the world's information. In 1919, soon after the end of World War I, they convinced the government of Belgium to give them the space and funding for this project, arguing that it would help Belgium bolster its bid to house the [[League of Nations]] headquarters. They were given space in the left wing of the {{lang|fr|[[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]]}}, a government building in [[Brussels]]. They then hired staff to help add to their Universal Bibliographic Repertory. \n\nIn 1921 Otlet wrote to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] offering the use of the Palais Mondial for the [[Pan-African_Congress#2nd_Pan-African_Congress|2nd Pan-African Congress]]. Although both Otlet and Fontaine offered a warm welcome to the Congress, these sentiments were not shared across all of Belgian society. The Brussels based paper ''Neptune'' stated that the organisers \u2013 particularly the [[National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]] were funded by the [[Bolsheviks]] and raised concern that it might lead to difficulties in the [[Belgian Congo]] by drawing together \"all the ne\u2019er-do-wells of the various tribes of the Colony, aside from some hundreds of labourers.\u201d<ref name=\"Colonial and Coloured Unity\">{{cite book |last1=Padmore |first1=George |title=Colonial and Coloured Unity: A Programme of Action; History of the Pan-African Congress, edited by George Padmore 1947 |date=1947 |publisher=The Hammersmith Bookshop |location=London |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/padmore/1947/pan-african-congress/ch05.htm |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Palais Mondial was briefly shuttered in 1922, due to lack of support from the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Theunis]], but was reopened after lobbying from Otlet and La Fontaine. Otlet renamed the Palais Mondial to the Mundaneum in 1924. The RBU steadily grew to 13 million index cards in 1927;  by its final year, 1934, it had reached more than 15 million.<ref name=\"xanadu\">[[W.

May 1994.</ref> Index cards were stored in custom-designed cabinets, and indexed according to the Universal Decimal Classification. The collection also grew to include files (including letters, reports, newspaper articles, etc.) and images, contained in separate rooms; the index cards were meant to catalog all of these as well. The Mundaneum eventually contained 100,000 files and millions of images.\n\nIn 1934, the Belgian government again cut off funding for the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when [[Germany]] invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of [[Third Reich]] art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues to find a new home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]] they reconstituted the Mundaneum as best as they could, and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death.\n\n== The World City ==\nThe World City or Cit\u00e9 Mondiale is a utopian vision by Paul Otlet of a city which like a universal exhibition brings together all the leading institutions of the world.<ref>In 2011 [http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ Wouter Van Acker] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717155012/http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ |date=17 July 2012 }} completed  his PhD on the visionary schemes and schemas of Paul Otlet.</ref> The World City would radiate knowledge to the rest of the world and construct peace and universal cooperation. Otlet\u2019s idea to design a utopian city dedicated to international institutions was largely inspired by the contemporary publication in 1913 by the Norwegian-American sculptor [[Hendrik Christian Andersen]] and the French architect [[Ernest H\u00e9brard]] of an impressive series of Beaux-Arts plans for a World Centre of Communication (1913). For the design of his World City, Otlet collaborated with several architects. In this way a whole series of designs for the World City was developed. The most elaborated plans were: the design of a Mundaneum (1928) and a World City (1929) by [[Le Corbusier]] in Geneva next to the palace of the League of Nations, by Victor Bourgeois in Tervuren (1931) next to the Congo Museum, again by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Huib Hoste) on the left bank in Antwerp (1933), by Maurice Heymans in Chesapeake Bay near Washington (1935), and by Stanislas Jassinski and Rapha\u00ebl Delville on the left bank in Antwerp (1941). In these different designs the program of the World City stayed more or less fixed, containing a World Museum, a World University, a World Library and Documentation Centre, Offices for the International Associations, Offices or Embassies for the Nations, an Olympic Centre, a residential area, and a park.\n\n== Exploring new media ==\nOtlet integrated new media, as they were invented, into his vision of the networked knowledge-base of the future. In the early 1900s, Otlet worked with engineer [[Robert Goldschmidt]] on storing bibliographic data on [[microfilm]] (then known as \"micro-photography\"). These experiments continued into the 1920s, and by the late 1920s he attempted along with colleagues to create an encyclopedia printed entirely on microfilm, known as the ''{{lang|la|Encyclopaedia Microphotica Mundaneum}}'', which was housed in the Mundaneum. In the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote about radio and television as other forms of conveying information, writing in the 1934 ''{{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 de documentation}}'' that \"one after another, marvellous inventions have immensely extended the possibilities of documentation.\" In the same book, he predicted that media that would convey feel, taste and smell would also eventually be invented, and that an ideal information-conveyance system should be able to handle all of what he called \"sense-perception documents\".\n\n==Political views and involvement==\n\nOtlet was a firm believer in international cooperation to promote both the spread of knowledge and peace between nations. A self-identified liberal, [[Universalism|universalist]] and pacifist, his endeavor to catalog and classify is an expression of the commitment to the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] project to structure knowledge according to universal categories and taxonomies, of which the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] is an example.<ref name=\"Omission and validation\"> {{cite document |last1=Mugrefya |first1=Elodie |title=Omission and validation |date=2019 |publisher=Constant |location=Brussels }}</ref> The Union of International Associations, which he had founded in 1907 with Henri La Fontaine, later participated to the development of both the [[League of Nations]] and the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which was later merged into [[UNESCO]].\n\nAt several occasions, Otlet published racist statements dressed up as scientific facts, starting at the beginning of his career with ''L'Afrique Aux Noirs'' (1888)<ref name=\"\u2018L\u2019Afrique Aux Noirs\">{{cite book |last1=Otlet |first1=Paul |title=L\u2019Afrique Aux Noirs |date=1888 |publisher=Ferdinand Larcier |location=Brussels |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58828/58828-h/58828-h.htm |accessdate=}}</ref> where he argued that white people or 'westernized' blacks were to be tasked with [[Civilizing mission|'civilising']] Africa. Similarly, in ''Monde'' (1935) <ref name=\"\u2018Monde\">{{cite document |last1=Otlet |first1=Paul |title=Monde|date=1888 |publisher=Editions Mundaneum |location=Brussels |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Fichier:Otlet_-_Monde_-_1935.djvu |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>, near the end of his life, he claimed the biological superiority of white people. His interest in advancing \u2018The African Issue\u2019 was fuelled by a firm conviction of the superiority of European culture and intelligence which fitted the [[Enlightenment]] project that he was dedicated to.<ref name=\"omissum\">{{cite document |author1=Mondotheque |author2=Algolit |title=Paul Otlet, an Omissum |date=2020 |publisher=Constant |location=Brussels |url=https://diversions.constantvzw.org/paul-otlet-an-omissum.html |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Otlet\u2019s organisational support to the 1921 [[Pan-African Congress]] at the ''Palais Mondial'' (later: [[Mundaneum]]) therefore needs to be considered in connection with the racist statements that he published both before and after the event.\n\nIn 1933, Otlet proposed building in Belgium near [[Antwerp]] a \"gigantic neutral [[World City]]\" to employ a massive number of workers, in order to alleviate the unemployment generated by the [[Great Depression]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744944-1,00.html Work for All the World], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 23 January 1933</ref>\n\n== Fade into obscurity ==\nOtlet died in 1944, not long before the end of World War II, having seen his major project, the Mundaneum, shuttered, and having lost all his funding sources. According to Otlet scholar [[W. Boyd Rayward]]:\n\n: \"The First World War marked the end of the intellectual as well as sociopolitical era in which Otlet had functioned hitherto with remarkable success. After the war, he and his schemes were never taken seriously except with the circle of his disciples. He quickly lost the support of the Belgian government. In the late 1920s he faced the defection of his followers in the International Institute of Documentation, as the International Institute of Bibliography \" <ref>W. Boyd Rayward, \"Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868\u20131944) and Hypertext\", ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 4(4), May 1994, p. 284.</ref>\n\nAnd:\n\n: \"Perhaps at one level, Otlet, is best regarded as a fin de si\u00e8cle figure whose work enjoyed a considerable measure of acceptance and support at home and abroad before World War I. But after the War, it rapidly lost favour. Once influential nationally and internationally, at least in a relatively specialised circle, Otlet came to be regarded as difficult and obstructive as he grew old. His ideas and the extraordinary institutional arrangements in which they had finally come to be expressed, the Palais Mondial or Mundaneum, seemed grandiose, unfocused and pass\u00e9. In the early 1930s there was a quietly dramatic struggle to remove the International Institute of Bibliography, transformed eventually into the International Federation for Documentation, from this institutional complex and from under what was considered to be the dead hand of the past - effectively the hand of the still very much alive but ageing Otlet.\" <ref>W. Boyd Rayward,  \"Knowledge organisation and a new world polity:the rise and fall and rise of the ideas of Paul Otlet\", ''Transnational Associations'', no. 1-2 (2003), p. 4.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of [[World War II]], the contributions of Otlet to the field of information science were lost sight of in the rising popularity of the ideas of American information scientists such as [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Ted Nelson]] and by such theorists of information organization as [[Seymour Lubetzky]].\n\n== Rediscovery ==\nBeginning in the 1980s, and especially after the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s, new interest arose in Otlet's speculations and theories about the organization of knowledge, the use of information technologies, and globalization. His 1934 masterpiece, the ''Trait\u00e9 de documentation'', was reprinted in 1989 by the [[Centre de Lecture publique de la Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]] in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|title=Trait\u00e9 De Documentation (original manuscript)|format=PDF|website=archive.ugent.be|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607052400/https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|archivedate=7 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (Neither the Trait\u00e9 nor its companion work, \"Monde\" (World) has been translated into English so far.) In 1990 Professor W. Boyd Rayward published an English translation of some of Otlet's writings.<ref>{{cite document|title=International Organisation and Dissemination of Knowledge (original manuscript)|hdl = 2142/4004}}</ref> He also published a biography of Otlet (1975) that was translated into Russian (1976) and Spanish (1996, 1999, and 2005).\n\nIn 1985, Belgian academic [[Andr\u00e9 Canonne]] raised the possibility of recreating the Mundaneum as an archive and museum devoted to Otlet and others associated with them; his idea initially was to house it in the Belgian city of [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]. Cannone, with substantial help from others, eventually managed to open the new Mundaneum in  [[Mons]], Belgium in 1998.  This museum is still in operation, and contains the personal papers of Otlet and La Fontaine and the archives of the various organizations they created along with other collections important to the modern history of Belgium.\n\n== Analysis of Otlet's theories ==\n\nOtlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward has written that Otlet's thinking is a product of the 19th century and the philosophy of [[positivism]], which holds that, through careful study and the [[scientific method]], an objective view of the world can be gained. According to W. Boyd Rayward, his ideas placed him culturally and intellectually in the [[Belle \u00c9poque]] period of pre\u2013World War I Europe, a period of great \"cultural certitude\".\n\nOtlet's writings have sometimes been called prescient of the current [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-man-who-envisioned-the-internet-before-computers-without-computers?trk_source=popular|title=The Man Who Envisioned the Internet Before Computers, Without Computers|work=Motherboard}}</ref> His vision of a great network of [[knowledge]] was centered on [[document]]s and included the notions of [[hyperlink]]s, [[search engine]]s, remote access, and [[social network]]s\u2014although these notions were described by different names.<ref>Charles van den Heuvel, \"Building Society, Constructing Knowledge, Weaving the Web\".

Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both women and men as characters and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}</ref>\n\nThere are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]]. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things.<ref>Feuchtwang, Sephan. \u201cChinese Religions.\u201d Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third ed., Routledge, 2016, pp. 150-151.</ref> Included among these forms are humans. Many natural [[Dualistic cosmology|dualities]] (such as [[light and dark]], fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical [[Chinese science]] and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],<ref name=Porkert1974>{{cite book|author=Porkert|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=MIT Press|year=1974|isbn=0-262-16058-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theoreticalfound00pork}}</ref> and a central principle of different forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] and exercise, such as [[baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] (t'ai chi), and [[qigong]] (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the ''[[I Ching]]''.\n\nThe notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as [[Duality (CoPs)|Communities of Practice]]. The term \"dualistic-monism\" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Georges Ohsawa]]|year=1976|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oQqDZnm43mkC&printsec=frontcover|title=The Unique Principle|isbn=978-0-918860-17-0|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light).  Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation.

''Yinyang'' meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".<ref name=\"Ames\" />\n\n==History==\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\">Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956</ref> He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9112\u884d}}; 305 \u2013 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\" />\n\n=== Chinese gender roles ===\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]</ref> Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\n==Nature==\nIn [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at chapter 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref>&nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref> Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 .

Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both women and men as characters and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}</ref>\n\nThere are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]].

The term \"dualistic-monism\" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality.

Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation.

Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\" />\n\n=== Chinese gender roles ===\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]</ref> Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\n==Nature==\nIn [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at chapter 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref>&nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref> Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 . [[JSTOR]]</ref>\n\nYin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.<ref>Li CL. A brief outline of Chinese medical history with particular reference to acupuncture. Perspect Biol Med. 1974 Autumn;18(1):132-43.</ref>  If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has [[Emptiness|vacuity]].\n\n===''I Ching''===\nIn the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000\u2013750 BC),<ref>\nThe text of the ''I Ching'' has its origins in a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u6613}} ''Zh\u014du y\u00ec'').  Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five \"Confucian\" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.</ref> yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268b</span>) and yang is solid (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268a</span>). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' \u2631) or more yin (''e.g.'' \u2635) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', \u2630 is heavily yang, while \u2637 is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4dd5</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4ddf</span>). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\n===Taijitu===\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|The \"taichi symbol\" (''[[taijitu]]'').]]\n{{Main|Taijitu}}\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]\"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the [[swastika]], common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in [[Celtic art]] and [[Notitia Dignitatum#Depictions|Roman shield markings]].<ref name=\"Giovanni Monastra (2000)\">Giovanni Monastra: \"[http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html#t24 The \"Yin\u2013Yang\" among the Insignia of the Roman Empire?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925054740/http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html |date=2011-09-25 }},\" \"Sophia,\" Vol. 6, No. 2 (2000)</ref><ref name=\"Late Roman Shield Patterns\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/luke/ueda-sarson/MagisterPeditum.html|title=Late Roman Shield Patterns - Magister Peditum|work=www.ne.jp}}</ref><ref name=\"Helmut Nickel (1992), 146, 5\">Helmut Nickel: \"The Dragon and the Pearl,\" ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' Vol. 26 (1991), p. 146, Fn. 5</ref>\n\n===Taijiquan===\n{{main|T'ai chi ch'uan}}\nTaijiquan ({{lang|zh|\u592a\u6781\u62f3}}), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body.

In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the [[I Ching|changes]] of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the ''yin'' and ''yang'' of ''Taiji'' have not yet divided apart.'
