Over the course of six days, [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]], a radical Islamic group, held hostages (including Prime Minister [[A. N. R. Robinson]] and other government officials) at the [[The Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|Red House]] and at the headquarters of the state-owned national television broadcaster, [[Trinidad and Tobago Television|Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT)]]. On 1 August, the insurgents surrendered. They were charged with treason, but were ordered released by the Court of Appeal.\n\n== Background ==\n===Conflict over No. 1 Mucurapo Road===\nThe Jamaat al Muslimeen was founded in 1982 by [[Yasin Abu Bakr]], a former policeman and convert to Islam, and established a compound at No. 1 Mucurapo Road in [[Port of Spain]], on land owned by the Port of Spain City Corporation. In 1969, the property was granted to the [[Islamic Missionaries Guild]] by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, but the transfer had never completed because the land belonged to the city, not the central government. In 1984 a court ordered the Muslimeen to vacate the property and demolish the buildings they had constructed without planning permission, including an incomplete [[mosque]]. Abu Bakr refused to comply and served a 21-day jail sentence for [[contempt of court]] in 1985.<ref name = \"Mahabir\">{{Cite journal|last=Mahabir|first=C.|date=2013-01-01|title=Allah's Outlaws: The Jamaat al Muslimeen of Trinidad and Tobago|journal=British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=59\u201373|doi=10.1093/bjc/azs058|issn=0007-0955}}</ref><ref name = \"Ragoonath\">{{Cite journal|last=Ragoonath|first=Bishnu|date=1993|title=The failure of the Abu Bakr coup: The plural society, cultural traditions and political development in Trinidad|journal=The Journal of Commonwealth & Comparative Politics|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=33\u201353|doi=10.1080/14662049308447655|issn=0306-3631}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-drug campaign ===\nIn the mid-1980s the Muslimeen launched a [[Vigilantism|vigilante]] campaign against the illegal drug trade.

After a year of break, a second season was aired on January 31, 2017. Since Episode 20 on May 23, 2017, it became a weekly show.\n\n== Format ==\nEach episode of ''Run BTS'' features the members of [[BTS (band)|BTS]] take on activities relevant to the episode's theme, usually in the form of games, missions or challenges in which they can earn prizes or punishments.<ref name=\":0\" /> The members tackle the mission as a band, by forming teams or by individual basis if the mission so requires. Few special episodes also featured noncompetitive activities such as fashion show and skit or drama making.\n\nIn most episodes, the show is led by an MC, the show's host/presenter and, along with the production staff, the facilitator of the missions. Renowned MCs among BTS members are [[Suga (rapper)|Suga]] and [[Kim Seok-jin|Jin]]; members [[J-Hope]] and [[V (singer)|V]] have also taken temporary MC roles. The entire BTS becomes the show presenter for episodes with missions that require an all-member participation.\n\n''Run BTS'' had a runtime of 8\u201315 minutes during its first season. By the second season onward, the show had a runtime of 20\u201330 minutes.\n\n=== BTS+ Behind the Scene ===\nThere are also exclusive behind-the-scenes short clips uploaded during each season's run of ''Run BTS'' after each episode is aired.

When the meeting turns into a heated argument, the meeting\u2019s moderator, Nam-joon, decide that each dormer should contribute an idea.<br/>\nSeok-jin goes first and proposes the rule: ''Do not put makeup products in the refrigerator.'' In a flashback, Seok-jin had gone to the kitchen and discovered his co-dormers\u2019 makeup products filling the refrigerator, leaving little space for food. When the dormers become divided on the rule, Yoon-gi suggests having a separate fridge for cosmetics.<br/>\nNext, Ji-min suggests the rule: ''Do not put your belongings in others\u2019 room.'' In a flashback, Tae-hyung had left a stuffed toy and a heart-shaped lamp in Seok-jin\u2019s and Ji-min\u2019s room, respectively. Tae-hyung insists to Ji-min that it was only his way of sharing his things to his fellow occupants. Yoon-gi also points out how Nam-joon did the same thing. In another flashback, Nam-joon had left a sweater in Yoon-gi\u2019s room after a failed shopping; Yoon-gi, who also found the sweater not for his size, had left the sweater in Ho-seok\u2019s room.<br/>\nAs the dormers see sharing things as a good thing for them, Ho-seok suggests canceling Ji-min\u2019s proposed rule and offers his own: ''Tidy up by yourself.'' In a flashback, Ho-seok had found Ji-min sleeping in his room and messing up with his clothes. In another instance, Ho-seok had woke up to find clothes and ice cream wrappers littering the floor. Angered by the mess, he found the culprits\u2014Jung-kook, Tae-hyung, and Nam-joon\u2014idling in the common room and watching TV while eating their ice cream.<br/>\nConnecting to Ho-seok\u2019s suggestion, Ji-min reminds the group to put their shoes in order, to which Seok-jin vehemently complains, stressing the lack of space in the dorm. When Tae-hyung mutters Jung-kook\u2019s name, Jung-kook simply responds with a \u201cWhat?\u201d The next rule is laid out: ''Bring an adequate amount of belongings.'' A flashback reveals Jung-kook bringing too many objects inside the dorm.<br/>\nSuddenly, the doorbell rings and Yoon-gi reveals he had ordered chicken for their lunch. With excitement, all except Nam-joon rush out of the common area. Nam-joon, nevertheless, joins the group and the seven dormers happily enjoy their meal.}}\n| LineColor           = lightpink}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 77\n| Aux1               = \"Food Guest\" (Part 1)\n| Aux2                = Jin\n| Aux3                = Team Kim Seok-jin <small> (J-Hope, Jimin, & V) </small> '''\u00b7''' Team Seok-jin Kim <small> (RM, Suga, & Jungkook) </small>\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|06|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = BTS plays multiple rounds of food guessing, each round the winning team gets 2 plates for food, the losing team gets nothing and will face a penalty.\n| LineColor           = lightpink}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 78\n| Aux1               = \"Food Guest\" (Part 2)\n| Aux2                = Jin\n| Aux3                =  <small> (J-Hope, Jimin, & V) </small> '''\u00b7''' Team Seok-jin Kim <small> (RM, Suga, & Jungkook) </small>\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|06|02}}\n| ShortSummary        = BTS plays the last three rounds of food guessing.Team Seok-jin Kim wins.

When the meeting turns into a heated argument, the meeting\u2019s moderator, Nam-joon, decide that each dormer should contribute an idea.<br/>\nSeok-jin goes first and proposes the rule: ''Do not put makeup products in the refrigerator.'' In a flashback, Seok-jin had gone to the kitchen and discovered his co-dormers\u2019 makeup products filling the refrigerator, leaving little space for food. When the dormers become divided on the rule, Yoon-gi suggests having a separate fridge for cosmetics.<br/>\nNext, Ji-min suggests the rule: ''Do not put your belongings in others\u2019 room.'' In a flashback, Tae-hyung had left a stuffed toy and a heart-shaped lamp in Seok-jin\u2019s and Ji-min\u2019s room, respectively. Tae-hyung insists to Ji-min that it was only his way of sharing his things to his fellow occupants. Yoon-gi also points out how Nam-joon did the same thing. In another flashback, Nam-joon had left a sweater in Yoon-gi\u2019s room after a failed shopping; Yoon-gi, who also found the sweater not for his size, had left the sweater in Ho-seok\u2019s room.<br/>\nAs the dormers see sharing things as a good thing for them, Ho-seok suggests canceling Ji-min\u2019s proposed rule and offers his own: ''Tidy up by yourself.'' In a flashback, Ho-seok had found Ji-min sleeping in his room and messing up with his clothes. In another instance, Ho-seok had woke up to find clothes and ice cream wrappers littering the floor. Angered by the mess, he found the culprits\u2014Jung-kook, Tae-hyung, and Nam-joon\u2014idling in the common room and watching TV while eating their ice cream.<br/>\nConnecting to Ho-seok\u2019s suggestion, Ji-min reminds the group to put their shoes in order, to which Seok-jin vehemently complains, stressing the lack of space in the dorm. When Tae-hyung mutters Jung-kook\u2019s name, Jung-kook simply responds with a \u201cWhat?\u201d The next rule is laid out: ''Bring an adequate amount of belongings.'' A flashback reveals Jung-kook bringing too many objects inside the dorm.<br/>\nSuddenly, the doorbell rings and Yoon-gi reveals he had ordered chicken for their lunch.

Nathan Morgan tries to teach his son David to be a man and survive in difficult times with their dog, Sounder. But Nathan is imprisoned for a year after stealing a ham to feed his starving family. On his way to visit his father, David discovers a school. A kindly but firm teacher named Camille takes him in and teaches him about important African-American figures in history. David becomes desperate to go to school, but when his father is released a maimed man, David must choose between an education that can give him a better life and staying home to support his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Cicely Tyson]] as Rebecca\n*[[Paul Winfield]] as Nathan Lee\n*[[Kevin Hooks]] as David Lee\n*[[Carmen Matthews]] as Mrs. Boatwright\n*[[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] as Ike\n*[[James Best]] as Sheriff Young\n*Eric Hooks as Earl\n*Yvonne Jarrell as Josie Mae\n*Sylvia \"Kuumba\" Williams as Harriet\n*Ted Airhart as Mr. Perkins\n*Richard Durham as Perkins' Foreman\n*Wendell Brumfield as Deputy #1\n*Al Bankston as Deputy #2\n*Merle Sharkey as Teacher\n*Inez Durham as Court Clerk\n*Judge William Thomas Bennett as Judge\n*Reverend Thomas N.

He noted that he at first refused the assignment, but producer Robert B. Radnitz and director Martin Ritt convinced him to work with them, saying \"I wanted to keep ''Sounder'' accurate in its historical context, and not go off on any present-day fantasies.\"<ref name=\"AFI\">[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54380 \"Sounder\"]. [[American Film Institute]]. Retrieved March 1, 2014.</ref>\n\nA notable aspect of casting in the film is that the minister is played by an actual minister and the judge is played by an actual judge.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nTaj Mahal recorded a soundtrack to the film, released in 1972 by [[Columbia Records]]. According to music journalist [[Robert Christgau]], it was \"the first soundtrack ever patterned after a [[field recording]]\", featuring a \"suite/montage/succession of hums, moans, claps, and plucked fragments\", all performed in the [[key (music)|key]] of the [[gospel blues]] song \"Needed Time\" by [[Lightnin' Hopkins]]. Fellow critic [[Greil Marcus]] regarded it as Mahal's \"most eloquent music\", although Christgau said \"even Greil doesn't know anybody who agrees. I've always regarded field recordings as study aids myself.\" He gave the soundtrack album a C-plus in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: M|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=M&bk=70|accessdate=March 2, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Sounder'' received warm reviews, and was praised as a welcome antidote to the contemporaneous wave of [[Blaxploitation|black films]], most of which were considered of low quality and budget and exploitative. The film\u2019s depiction of a loving family was hailed as a banner accomplishment for black filmmakers and audiences. ''Variety'' wrote that the picture had been \"for good or ill, singled out to test whether the black audience will respond to serious films about the black experience rather than the 'super black' exploitation features.\"<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nSome of ''Sounder'''s success was due to its innovative marketing strategy. Fox focused on group sales in major cities and targeted religious organizations and schools.

Nathan Morgan tries to teach his son David to be a man and survive in difficult times with their dog, Sounder. But Nathan is imprisoned for a year after stealing a ham to feed his starving family. On his way to visit his father, David discovers a school. A kindly but firm teacher named Camille takes him in and teaches him about important African-American figures in history. David becomes desperate to go to school, but when his father is released a maimed man, David must choose between an education that can give him a better life and staying home to support his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Cicely Tyson]] as Rebecca\n*[[Paul Winfield]] as Nathan Lee\n*[[Kevin Hooks]] as David Lee\n*[[Carmen Matthews]] as Mrs. Boatwright\n*[[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] as Ike\n*[[James Best]] as Sheriff Young\n*Eric Hooks as Earl\n*Yvonne Jarrell as Josie Mae\n*Sylvia \"Kuumba\" Williams as Harriet\n*Ted Airhart as Mr. Perkins\n*Richard Durham as Perkins' Foreman\n*Wendell Brumfield as Deputy #1\n*Al Bankston as Deputy #2\n*Merle Sharkey as Teacher\n*Inez Durham as Court Clerk\n*Judge William Thomas Bennett as Judge\n*Reverend Thomas N.

He noted that he at first refused the assignment, but producer Robert B. Radnitz and director Martin Ritt convinced him to work with them, saying \"I wanted to keep ''Sounder'' accurate in its historical context, and not go off on any present-day fantasies.\"<ref name=\"AFI\">[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54380 \"Sounder\"].

According to music journalist [[Robert Christgau]], it was \"the first soundtrack ever patterned after a [[field recording]]\", featuring a \"suite/montage/succession of hums, moans, claps, and plucked fragments\", all performed in the [[key (music)|key]] of the [[gospel blues]] song \"Needed Time\" by [[Lightnin' Hopkins]]. Fellow critic [[Greil Marcus]] regarded it as Mahal's \"most eloquent music\", although Christgau said \"even Greil doesn't know anybody who agrees.

The film\u2019s depiction of a loving family was hailed as a banner accomplishment for black filmmakers and audiences. ''Variety'' wrote that the picture had been \"for good or ill, singled out to test whether the black audience will respond to serious films about the black experience rather than the 'super black' exploitation features.\"<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nSome of ''Sounder'''s success was due to its innovative marketing strategy. Fox focused on group sales in major cities and targeted religious organizations and schools. Radnitz personally visited 35 cities and held over 500 screenings, with 60 simultaneous sneak previews held in New York City. The religious establishment came out in favor of the film, with an endorsement by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting|Catholic Film Office]] and a study guide for religious educators created by the [[National Council of Churches]].

For example, iPhone commands such as \"What is the weather going to be like?\" will generate a response such as \"The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&nbsp;degrees today.\" These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.<ref name=\"vangrove\" />\n\nOn the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell-checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.<ref name=\"4S\" />\n\nAt the announcement, plans were in place for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} to support many languages. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.<ref name=\"vergejoshua\"/> Since it uses a software-based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can display different languages and scripts at the same time.<ref name=\"chaffin\" />\n\nOn September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was released to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Donna |title=Apple's iOS 6 release date: Start your downloads on Sept. 19 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[CNET]] |date=September 12, 2012 |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57510600-37/apples-ios-6-release-date-start-your-downloads-on-sept-19/ |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed [[Apple Maps]], [[Facebook]] integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gunther |first=Cory |title=What\u2019s new in iOS 6?

Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting that they should not upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the [[iPad 2]], but it still did not run as fast as newer models.\n\n===iOS 9 controversy===\nOn June 8, 2015, Apple announced at the [[WWDC]] that the iPhone 4S would support [[iOS 9]]. This makes it the first iPhone to support 5 major versions of iOS, and the second iOS device to support 5 major versions (iOS 9 will support the iPad 2 as well, bringing its total up to six major versions of iOS supported). On December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update with slow and buggy software or to pay hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Apple announced that the iPhone 4S will not support [[iOS 10]] due to hardware limitations.\n\nIt was briefly possible to downgrade the iPhone 4S from iOS 9 to iOS 6.1.3 following a signing window, which opened in January 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/users-able-downgrade-from-ios-11/|title=Apple servers currently signing older iOS updates, users able to downgrade from iOS 11|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> and closed in November 2019. The option to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 also allowed an over-the-air update to iOS 8.4.1 due to technical limitations preventing a direct update from iOS 6 to iOS 9.\n\n====2019 GPS rollover update====\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S to fix issues caused by the [[GPS Week Number Rollover|GPS week number rollover]].

For example, iPhone commands such as \"What is the weather going to be like?\" will generate a response such as \"The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&nbsp;degrees today.\" These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.<ref name=\"vangrove\" />\n\nOn the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell-checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.<ref name=\"4S\" />\n\nAt the announcement, plans were in place for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} to support many languages. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.<ref name=\"vergejoshua\"/> Since it uses a software-based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can display different languages and scripts at the same time.<ref name=\"chaffin\" />\n\nOn September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was released to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Donna |title=Apple's iOS 6 release date: Start your downloads on Sept. 19 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[CNET]] |date=September 12, 2012 |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57510600-37/apples-ios-6-release-date-start-your-downloads-on-sept-19/ |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed [[Apple Maps]], [[Facebook]] integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gunther |first=Cory |title=What\u2019s new in iOS 6?

Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting that they should not upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the [[iPad 2]], but it still did not run as fast as newer models.\n\n===iOS 9 controversy===\nOn June 8, 2015, Apple announced at the [[WWDC]] that the iPhone 4S would support [[iOS 9]]. This makes it the first iPhone to support 5 major versions of iOS, and the second iOS device to support 5 major versions (iOS 9 will support the iPad 2 as well, bringing its total up to six major versions of iOS supported). On December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update with slow and buggy software or to pay hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Apple announced that the iPhone 4S will not support [[iOS 10]] due to hardware limitations.\n\nIt was briefly possible to downgrade the iPhone 4S from iOS 9 to iOS 6.1.3 following a signing window, which opened in January 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/users-able-downgrade-from-ios-11/|title=Apple servers currently signing older iOS updates, users able to downgrade from iOS 11|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> and closed in November 2019. The option to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 also allowed an over-the-air update to iOS 8.4.1 due to technical limitations preventing a direct update from iOS 6 to iOS 9.\n\n====2019 GPS rollover update====\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S to fix issues caused by the [[GPS Week Number Rollover|GPS week number rollover]].

One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users, who are unable to refuse, defeat, or alter that update, and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel. A user could \"refuse\" OTA but the \"channel manager\" could also \"kick them off\" the channel automatically.\n\nIn the context of the [[mobile content]] world these include '''over-the-air service provisioning''' (OTASP), '''over-the-air provisioning''' (OTAP) or '''over-the-air parameter administration''' (OTAPA),  or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as [[Wireless access point|WAP]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].\n\nAs mobile phones accumulate new applications and become more advanced, OTA configuration has become increasingly important as new updates and services come on stream.

It is often necessary to turn the phone off and back on for the new programming to take effect, though many phones will automatically perform this action.\n\n== Methods ==\n\nDepending on implementation, OTA software delivery can be initiated upon action, such as a call to the provider's customer support system or other dialable service, or can be performed automatically. Typically it is done via the former method to avoid service disruption at an inconvenient time, but this requires subscribers to manually call the provider. Often, a carrier will send a broadcast [[Short message service|SMS]] text message to all subscribers (or those using a particular model of phone) asking them to dial a service number to receive a software update.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] provides a number of OTA functions to its subscribers via the *228 service code. Option 1 updates phone configuration, option 2 updates the [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]]. Similarly Voitel Wireless and StraightTalk, which both use Verizon network, use 22890 service code to program Verizon based wireless phones. \n\nTo provision parameters in a mobile device OTA, the device needs to have a provisioning client capable of receiving, processing and setting the parameters.  For example, a Device Management client in a device may be capable of receiving and provisioning applications, or connectivity parameters.\n\nIn general, the term OTA implies the use of wireless mechanisms to send provisioning data or update packages for firmware or software updates to a mobile device&nbsp;\u2014 this is so that the user does not have to go to a store or a service center to have applications provisioned, parameters changed or firmware or software updated. Non-OTA options for a user are a) to go to a store and seek help b) use a PC and a cable to connect to the device and change settings on a device, add software to device, etc.\n\n== OTA standards ==\n\nThere are a number of standards that describe OTA functions. One of the first was the [[GSM 03.48]] series.\nThe ZigBee suite of standards includes the ZigBee Over-the-Air Upgrading Cluster which is part of the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile and provides an interoperable (vendor-independent) way of updating device firmware.\n\n== Similarities ==\n\nOTA is similar to firmware distribution methods used by other mass-produced [[consumer electronics]], such as [[cable modem]]s, which use [[TFTP]] as a way to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing the amount of time spent by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.\n\nOver-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is also available in wireless environments (though it is disabled by default for security reasons). It allows an access point (AP) to discover the IP address of its controller. When enabled, the controller tells the other APs to include additional information in the Radio Resource Management Packets (RRM) that would assist a new access point in learning of the controller. It is sent in plain text however, which would make it vulnerable to sniffing. That's why it is disabled by default.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Phone-as-Modem|Phone-as-Modem (PAM)]]\n*[[Access Point Name|Access Point Name (APN)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile technology]]\n[Category:Telecommunication services]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{ref improve|date=September 2011}}\n{{update|date=May 2015}}\n}}'''Over-the-Air programming''' (OTA) refers to various methods of distributing new [[software]], configuration settings, and even [[Over the Air Rekeying|updating encryption keys]] to devices like [[mobile phone]]s, [[set-top box]]es or [[Secure voice|secure voice communication]] equipment (encrypted 2-way radios). One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users, who are unable to refuse, defeat, or alter that update, and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel. A user could \"refuse\" OTA but the \"channel manager\" could also \"kick them off\" the channel automatically.\n\nIn the context of the [[mobile content]] world these include '''over-the-air service provisioning''' (OTASP), '''over-the-air provisioning''' (OTAP) or '''over-the-air parameter administration''' (OTAPA),  or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as [[Wireless access point|WAP]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].\n\nAs mobile phones accumulate new applications and become more advanced, OTA configuration has become increasingly important as new updates and services come on stream.

So far, the sole academic study found that readers of climate fiction \"are younger, more liberal, and more concerned about climate change than nonreaders,\" and that climate fiction \"reminds concerned readers of the severity of climate change while impelling them to imagine environmental futures and consider the impact of climate change on human and nonhuman life. However, the actions that resulted from readers\u2019 heightened consciousness reveal that awareness is only as valuable as the cultural messages about possible actions to take that are in circulation. Moreover, the responses of some readers suggest that works of climate fiction might lead some people to associate climate change with intensely negative emotions, which could prove counterproductive to efforts at environmental engagement or persuasion.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|date=November 2018|title=The Influence of Climate Fiction: An Empirical Survey of Readers|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/10/2/473/136689/The-Influence-of-Climate-FictionAn-Empirical|journal=Environmental Humanities|volume=10|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]]\n* [[Global warming in popular culture]]\n* [[Media coverage of climate change]]\n* [[Public opinion on climate change]]\n* [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerry Canavan and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]].

So far, the sole academic study found that readers of climate fiction \"are younger, more liberal, and more concerned about climate change than nonreaders,\" and that climate fiction \"reminds concerned readers of the severity of climate change while impelling them to imagine environmental futures and consider the impact of climate change on human and nonhuman life. However, the actions that resulted from readers\u2019 heightened consciousness reveal that awareness is only as valuable as the cultural messages about possible actions to take that are in circulation. Moreover, the responses of some readers suggest that works of climate fiction might lead some people to associate climate change with intensely negative emotions, which could prove counterproductive to efforts at environmental engagement or persuasion.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|date=November 2018|title=The Influence of Climate Fiction: An Empirical Survey of Readers|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/10/2/473/136689/The-Influence-of-Climate-FictionAn-Empirical|journal=Environmental Humanities|volume=10|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]]\n* [[Global warming in popular culture]]\n* [[Media coverage of climate change]]\n* [[Public opinion on climate change]]\n* [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerry Canavan and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]].
