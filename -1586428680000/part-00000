These vehicles originally utilized the [[cab over|cab-over-engine]] configuration, although since 1996 a semi-cab-over arrangement has featured instead. The LiteAce launched in 1970 as light-duty truck, with [[commercial vehicle|commercial]] and [[van]]/[[minivan|wagon]] body variants added in 1971. In 1976, Toyota released the larger TownAce van/wagon that derived from the LiteAce; a TownAce truck arrived later in 1978. Between 1982 and 1992, the series accommodated the '''MasterAce Surf'''\u2014an upscale TownAce passenger wagon.\n\nThe two model lines existed separately until 1982 when TownAce trucks became rebadged LiteAce trucks\u2014then in 1992 LiteAce vans became rebranded TownAce vans\u2014thus unifying the once separate vehicle lines. In Japan, the LiteAce retailed at ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Auto Store]]'' dealerships, with the TownAce sold at ''Toyota Corolla Store'' dealerships. The LiteAce and TownAce have been commonly exported to Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the years, select LiteAce/TownAce models have also been available with [[Daihatsu Delta]] badging in Japan. Originally sold as the Delta 750 based on the LiteAce truck, later versions have been badged Delta Wide and based on the TownAce van. For the final Delta retailed between 1996 and 2001, the \"Wide\" suffix disappeared.\n\nThe LiteAce followed the introduction of the more compact [[Toyota MiniAce|MiniAce]] and larger [[Toyota HiAce#H10|HiAce]] in 1967, acting as an intermediacy between these two models in size and carrying capacity. By the mid-1970s, the MiniAce had been retired and the HiAce had grown, thus creating a void in the market resumed by the TownAce. The \"Ace\" moniker references the [[Toyota Toyoace]] medium-duty truck sold starting 1956. The \"Lite\" in LiteAce refers to its light-duty capability, and the \"Town\" in TownAce alludes to the suitability of the model for urban areas.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class = \"navbox\"\n! colspan = \"92\" | Toyota LiteAce, TownAce, MasterAce timeline (Japan), 1970\u2013present\n|- style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 width = 5% | '''Model'''\n| rowspan = 2 width = 5% | '''Body style'''\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1970s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1980s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1990s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 2000s\n| colspan = 10 width = 20% | 2010s\n|- style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\"\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | LiteAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 3 |\n| colspan = 16 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M10|M10]]\n| colspan = 12 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 13 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M30|M30/M40]]\n| colspan = 9 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20 rebodied|R20/R30 rebodied]]\n| colspan = 22 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R40|R40/R50]]\n| colspan = 2 rowspan = 4 |\n| colspan = 13 rowspan = 4 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#S400|S400]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Truck\n| colspan = 1 |\n| colspan = 18 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M10|M10]]\n| colspan = 14 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 42 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M50|M50/M60/M70/M80]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | TownAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 13 |\n| colspan = 12 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R10|R10]]\n| colspan = 19 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20|R20/R30]]\n| colspan = 9 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20 rebodied|R20/R30 rebodied]]\n| colspan = 22 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R40|R40/R50]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Truck\n| colspan = 17 |\n| colspan = 8 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R10|R10]]\n| colspan = 8 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 42 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M50|M50/M60/M70/M80]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | MasterAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 20 |\n| colspan = 5 |\n| colspan = 19 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20|R20]]\n| colspan = 16 |\n| colspan = 20 |\n| colspan = 10 |\n|-\n| colspan = 92 | <div style=\"background-color:#999999;

In effect, LiteAce filled the gap between the smaller MiniAce and larger [[Toyota HiAce#H10|HiAce]] whilst keeping within [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle size regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement. This meant that buyers would not be liable for additional taxes for a larger vehicle as they were with the HiAce. LiteAce had also been developed following the growing popularity of affordable [[cab over|cab-over-engine trucks]] that could carry up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}. Whereas the MiniAce truck had just a {{convert|500|kg|lb|adj=on}} payload capacity, the LiteAce truck offered {{convert|750|kg|lb}} with a three-seat front [[bench seat|bench]].

Initially featuring just a single sliding door on the passenger side (curbside), the van/wagon was offered in three seating configurations, of one, two, and three rows\u2014providing for three (van), six (van), and nine (wagon) passengers, respectively. A five-door, dual sliding door version arrived in September 1973 as an option, along with a new high-roof wagon model. The nine-seater wagon was retired in 1975 as it did not satisfy new Japanese [[emission standards]]. Later in October 1976, the [[#R10|TownAce (R10)]] was released\u2014a larger model heavily based on the M10 series LiteAce.\n\nDesign-wise, the front-end was distinguished by vertical, black resin grilles above each [[headlamp]]. A single chrome recess held both the lamp and the black panel in place; this extended from the [[windshield]] to just above the [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]]. The van/wagon featured a top-hinged back door, and ornate resin panels were placed above the [[automotive lighting#Rear position lamps (tail lamps)|tail lamps]] in accordance to the similar design upfront.\n\nThe LiteAce was designated KM10 when fitted with the 1166&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K]]'' [[inline-four engine]] producing {{convert|68|PS|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{citation | script-title = ja:\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8 |trans-title=Toyota Auto | type = catalog | language = Japanese | publisher = Toyota Motor Corporation | date = June 1977 | page = 12 | id = 041183-5206}}</ref> In February 1978, this was replaced by the larger 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K-J]]'' engine (KM11). At the same time, there was a small facelift including a design change to panels above the headlamps and new badging.\n\n;Daihatsu Delta 750\nThis model (truck only) was also marketed in a slightly different [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] form as the [[Daihatsu Delta|Daihatsu Delta 750]] (D10 series) from March 1971.

Widely exported for the first time, the M20 included seating for up to eight in the wagon with a 2/3/3 arrangement, including fully reclining seatbacks for the second and third rows. Options included dual-zone air conditioners, a four-speaker audio system, and aluminum wheels. The high-roof GXL wagon grade also offered a [[sunroof|moonroof]] option. Truck versions now included a \"just low\" model\u2014created by fitting 10-inch double tires to the rear wheels (as opposed to 13-inch for the front wheels) to lower the bed floor further.\n\nToyota fitted the 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K-J]]'' inline-four engine (designated KM20 with this engine) with {{convert|69|PS|kW|abbr=on}} to the van and truck initially, with the wagon receiving the 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#13T-U|13T-U]]'' inline-four (TM20) good for {{convert|92|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Both engines were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Updates to the wagon in December 1980 brought an optional three-speed automatic or five-speed manual as well. Further to these revisions, a flagship FXV grade joined the range and new second row seats with a swivel function to face either the forward or backwards position became optional in the wagon. In 1981, a \"handy-cab\" version that could accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair was introduced. A Montana package arrived in January 1982, complete with removable [[bunk bed|loft beds]] and electric curtains. Simultaneously, an eight-seat version with rear-facing second-row seats was introduced (being a 2/3/3 configuration). Then in April 1982, a medium roof height body variant with a twin moonroof was introduced.\n\n{{external media | float = left | image1 = [http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/11882111664_986c90e4c2_o.jpg 1979\u20131982 Daihatsu Delta 750]}}\n\nMinor changes to the M20 series LiteAce arrived for November 1982, including a front-end facelift and the adoption of [[power steering]]. The van gained the option of a 1626&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#1Y|1Y]]'' (YM20) engine with {{convert|84|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Toyota also upgraded the wagon's ''13T-U'' engine to the 1812&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#2Y|2Y]]'' (YM21; {{convert|95|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) while proving a new 1839&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#1C|1C]]'' diesel option ({{convert|63|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) across the various body variants range (CM20).\n\nWhen the second generation [[#R20|R20/R30]] series TownAce van/wagon arrived in November 1982, the M20 LiteAce truck became the donor model for the next TownAce truck, with minor trim changes distinguishing the two. The subsequent generation of LiteAce van/wagon arrived in September 1985, but M20 manufacture continued until October 1986 when the truck variant came to the market.\n\n;Daihatsu Delta 750\nLike the previous M10 series, the M20 TownAce again provided the base for the rebadged [[Daihatsu Delta|Daihatsu Delta 750]] (D20 series) truck sold between October 1979 and October 1982.<ref name = \"Yokohama\">{{cite web | url = http://www.yokohamamotors.com/images/Daihatsu%20Vehicle%20Production%20Codes.pdf | title = Daihatsu Vehicle & Production Code Data | publisher = Yokohama Motors | accessdate = 12 January 2014}}</ref> The ''4K-J'' engine was fitted and designated KD20.<ref name = \"GMB\">{{cite web | url = http://www.altayauto.org/files/catalogue/Water_Pump_Fun_Clutch.pdf | title = 2007 New Water Pump Fan Clutch, Section 4, Volume 1 | publisher = GMB Corporation | accessdate = 12 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 200 | height = 150\n| File:Lite ace KM20.JPG|1979\u20131982 LiteAce van (KM20; pre-facelift)\n| File:1984-1986 Toyota LiteAce (YM21) van (2011-04-02) 01.jpg|1982\u20131985 LiteAce van (YM21; facelift)\n| File:1984-1986 Toyota LiteAce (YM21) van (2011-04-02) 02.jpg|1982\u20131985 LiteAce van (YM21; facelift)\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|M30|M40|M50|M60|M70|M80}} 1985\u20132007 (M30, M40, M50, M60, M70, M80) LiteAce van/truck, TownAce truck ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = M30, M40, M50, M60, M70, M80\n| image = 1989 Toyota LiteAce (YM30) van (23309737442).jpg\n| caption = LiteAce van (YM30)\n| production = {{ubl\n  | September 1985 \u2013 December 1991 (van/wagon)\n  | October 1986 \u2013 July 2007 (truck)\n  }}\n| assembly = Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] (Honsha plant, 1985\u20132004); [[Hamura, Tokyo]] ([[Hino Motors|Hino]], 2004\u20132007)\n| body_style = {{ubl\n  | 2-door truck\n  | 4-door van/wagon\n  | 5-door van/wagon\n  }}\n| layout = {{ubl\n  | [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n  | [[front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, four-wheel-drive]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{ubl\n  | 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]] (gasoline)\n  | 1486&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#5K-U|5K-U]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1812&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#2Y-U|2Y-U]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1781&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#7K-E|7K-E]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#3Y-U|3Y-U]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1839&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#1C-II|1C-II]]'' I4 (diesel)\n  | 1974&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#2C|2C]]'' I4 (diesel)\n  | 1974&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#2C-T|2C-T]]'' I4-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel)\n  | 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-E|3C-E]]'' I4 (diesel)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n  | 4-speed manual\n  | 5-speed manual\n  | 3-speed automatic\n  | 4-speed automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|2085|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|2100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| length = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|4180|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|4240|-|4380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck; 1999)\n  | {{convert|3995|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| width = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n  | {{convert|1665|-|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck; 1999)\n  }}\n| height = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1795|-|1805|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1789|-|1820|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck; 1999)\n  | {{convert|1755|-|1965|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| weight = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1020|-|1110|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1050|-|1280|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| sp = us\n}}\n\nThe third generation LiteAce van/wagon (M30/M40 series) were placed on the market in September 1985 with four roof variations\u2014a standard roof, a high roof, a high roof with panoramic [[sunroof|moonroof]] (''Skylite'' roof), and a high roof for the SW grade. Dimensionally, body width increased at the expense of length. Improvements to stability and ride comfort were courtesy of an overhauled rear suspension type from a semi-elliptical [[leaf spring]] design to a four-link type with a [[Panhard rod]]. Further improvements were made by switching to [[rack and pinion]] steering.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Toyota Liteace Van 001.JPG\n| caption1 = 1985\u20131988 LiteAce van DX 4WD\n| image2 = Toyota Liteace Wagon 003.JPG\n| caption2 = 1988\u20131991 LiteAce wagon GXL (CM30G)\n}}\n\nThe interior was designed so that the driver's seating position was virtually the same as in a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. Seating options included standard first rows on the cargo van, plus second-row positions on the wagon (five- or six-seater) and optional third-row seats that could be stowed sideways to for additional luggage space. Select trims levels heralded a fully reclining driver's seat and with some, the second-row seats could be turned three-ways (forward, sideways, and backward).\n\nThe engine is reached through a small hatch beneath the front seat; this does not open very wide and the limited access came in for some complaint.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wren | first = Tim | date = June 1986 | title = Light Match | journal = Truck | location = London | publisher = FF Publishing | page = 79}}</ref> Engines fitted to the van/wagon included the 1486&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#5K-U|5K-U]]'' ({{convert|70|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and 1812&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#2Y-U|2Y-U]]'' ({{convert|79|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) gasoline engines and two 1974&nbsp;cc diesels\u2014the ''[[Toyota C engine#2C|2C]]'' ({{convert|70|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] ''[[Toyota C engine#2C-T|2C-T]]'' ({{convert|82|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}). In October 1985, a part-time [[four-wheel drive]] model was added to the model lineup.\n\nTruck variants of the third generation LiteAce and TownAce launched in October 1986, designated M50/M60/M70/M80. These came installed with the 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#3Y-U|3Y-U]]'' gasoline engine or the ''2C'' diesel. TownAce trucks were sold in two levels of trim, the unbadged DX and the more expensive Super X.\n\nIn a minor model change in August 1988, the front and rear of the van/wagon were redesigned, increasing the body length by {{convert|75|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. This facelift was for Japan only. At the same time, [[Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension]] (TEMS) was employed for the first time in a [[three-box styling|one-box]] wagon, and the output of the turbocharged diesel engine was boosted to {{convert|85|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. In September 1989, the new Super SW specification was added, and a five-door version with dual sliding doors could be specified in conjunction with the SW grade. The manual transmission increased from four- to five-gears in August 1990 along with the fitment of a [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|center high mount stop lamp]]. Then in October 1991, the four-wheel drive system became available with the truck body.\n\nAlthough the van/wagon lines were fully redesigned in January 1992 with the [[#R20 rebodied|rebodied R20]] series, the truck line was not renewed until the [[#S400|S400]] series in 2008, leaving the M50/M60/M70/M80 model in production until July 2007. Toyota issued a minor front-end facelift in November 1996 with a redesign of the single-piece plastic panel surrounding both headlamps\u2014this now included the attachment of the modern-day Toyota logo. More substantially updated LiteAce and TownAce trucks were released in June 1999, with the front section of the body and [[dashboard]] thoroughly redesigned\u2014however, the design of the doors and all parts rearward carried over verbatim. The optional four-wheel drive switched from part-time to full-time configuration, [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] were made standard, and [[airbag]]s an option. The gasoline engine was upgraded from to the 1781&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#7K-E|7K-E]]'', and the ''2C'' diesel engine made way for the 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-E|3C-E]]'' which remained in the market until discontinued in August 2004. From December 2004, production switched from the Honsha plant at [[Toyota, Aichi]] to the [[Hamura, Tokyo]] plant operated by the Toyota-owned [[Hino Motors]].\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 200 | height = 150\n| File:1989 Toyota LiteAce (YM30) van (23335655331).jpg|1989 LiteAce van\n| File:Toyota LiteAce FXV (M30).jpg|1988\u20131991 LiteAce wagon FXV\n| File:Toyota Liteace Truck 001.JPG|1986\u20131996 LiteAce truck \"just low\"\n| File:Town Ace with Wireframe Cargo Back.jpg|1986\u20131996 TownAce truck DX\n| File:Toyota Townace Truuk 001.JPG|1986\u20131996 TownAce truck Super X\n| File:Toyota Townace Truuk 003.JPG|1996\u20131999 TownAce truck DX\n| File:Toyota Liteace Truck 005.JPG|1999\u20132007 LiteAce truck\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== R-series ==\n\n=== {{anchor|R10}} 1976\u20131982 (R10) TownAce van/truck ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = R10\n| image = Toyota Town Ace Wagon 001.JPG\n| caption = 1978 TownAce wagon Custom Extra (TR15; pre-facelift)\n| aka = [[Daihatsu Delta|Daihatsu Delta Wide]] (B10)\n| production = {{ubl\n  | October 1976 \u2013 October 1982 (van/wagon)\n  | September 1978 \u2013 October 1982 (truck)\n  }}\n| assembly = Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] (Honsha plant)\n| body_style = {{ubl\n  | 2-door truck\n  | 4-door van/wagon\n  }}\n| layout = [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related = [[#M10|Toyota LiteAce (M10)]]\n| engine = {{ubl\n  | 1166&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K-J]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]] (gasoline)\n  | 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K-J|4K-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota R engine#12R|12R-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1588&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1588&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#12T|12T]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#13T|13T-U]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n  | 4-speed manual\n  | 5-speed manual\n  | 5-speed automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|2170|-|2295|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|2195|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| length = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|4110|-|4315|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|3990|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| width = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1650|-|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| height = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1840|-|1860|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1745|-|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| weight = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1080|-|1135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|965|-|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| sp = us\n}}\n\nThe first TownAce (R10 series) made its sales debut in October 1976 as a widened and lengthened version of the [[#M10|LiteAce (M10)]], still using the same doors and some other panels.

While the R20/R30 models were typically discontinued in export markets in 1990 with the release of this new model (usually badged [[Toyota Previa#XR10|Previa]] overseas), for Japan, production continued until January 1992. This was because unlike the R20/R30, the Estima did not fall under the \"number five\" [[tax bracket]] regarding [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle size tax legislation]]. To comply, dimensions had to remain under {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for width and {{convert|4700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, plus 2000&nbsp;cc for engine displacement.

North American markets called it the \"Toyota Van\" (VanWagon in early press materials), while Australia referred to the vehicle as the [[Toyota Tarago]] (named after [[Tarago, New South Wales]]). In parts of Europe it was known as the \"Toyota Space Cruiser\", but in Germany, Sweden, Norway, China and some countries of Latin America it was sold as the \"Toyota Model F\". Export models were partially replaced with the [[Toyota Previa]] in 1990.\n\nNorth American market sales started in 1983 for the 1984 [[model year]] as the \"Toyota Van\" with styling shared with the MasterAce Surf. The 2.0-liter ''3Y-U'' EFI ({{convert|87|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) came at launch, but was replaced with the 2.2-liter ''4Y-E'' engine with {{convert|102|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the 1986 model year facelift. Rear-wheel drive versions were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1989, while four-wheel drive models were sold between 1987 and 1989. The four-wheel drive models came with skid plates, with manual transmission models including a [[transfer case]] with low and high ranges (automatic models lacked a low range).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Toyota minivans: Van, Previa, and Sienna | url = http://www.toyoland.com/trucks/minivans.html | work = ToyoLand | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The Real Owners Manual | url = http://yotavans.org/community/tips/real_manual.html#trans | work = Toyota Van Community Site | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}</ref> All trim levels starting in 1986 had a [[Automotive lighting#Cornering lamps|cornering lamp]] system.

Deluxe and LE (Limited Edition) versions were offered as well as an ice maker/refrigerator between the front seats. The Van also offered dual air conditioning, captains chairs (LE for the 1986 to 1989 model years), twin [[sunroof]]s, digital clock, satellite radio controls (LE for the 1987 to 1989 model years), fog lights (LE for the 1986 to 1989 model years with power window package), tachometer, power locks, power windows, and a tinted glass privacy package. LE models had color matched bumpers and front grille along with power mirrors, chrome headlight bezels, and chrome Toyota emblems. Base models came with black bumpers and grill with white Toyota emblems. Base models have the reverse lights incorporated into the tail light assembly whereas the LE models had them incorporated into the rear hatch. In 1986, a special [[EXPO86]] version was available in Canada only. The 1986 model year Espirit model was finished in a unique light blue color with a white wave pattern on the lower half on the side profile.

Thus, from this time, the entire LiteAce and TownAce range (van and truck) were unified. The rebodied R20/R30 had a much more streamlined design. The LiteAce and TownAce commercial vans were very similar, differing by the TownAce receiving extra headlamps adjacent inside to the main units and a small air [[intake]] slit. The LiteAce did not have this intake, but instead had additional grilles where the extra lamps in the TownAce were. Passenger wagons of both models had different styling again. Here, the LiteAce front end featured two separate headlamp units that tapered inwards towards the Toyota logo. TownAce wagons had headlamps that sat flush with a translucent garnish that gave the appearance of a large, single headlamp. Rear styling also differed between the commercial vans and passenger wagons, although both models used the same rear-end regardless if badged LiteAce or TownAce.\n\nToyota Australia released the TownAce commercial van in April 1992.

Offered in van/wagon configurations only, the [[van]] sold as the LiteAce and TownAce, with [[minivan|wagon]]s now designated LiteAce Noah and TownAce Noah and fitted with a different, more luxurious interior. As with previous generation, LiteAce and TownAce were differentiated by their front [[grille]] designs. Vans were badged DX (for cargo purposes) and GL (dual purpose). Noah models received standard [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional twin [[sunroof|moonroofs]] (the Skylite roof was discontinued).\n\nTo meet new occupant safety regulations, the [[cab over|cab-over]], [[mid-engine design|mid-mounted engine]] was moved in front of the passenger compartment (semi-cab-over), giving the car an all-new look, although a move inline with the vehicle's competitors. Despite the trend among its Japanese competitors of switching to the [[front-wheel drive]] layout, the R40/R50 maintained its rear-wheel drive. Full-time four-wheel drive was optional, replacing the part-time configuration from the previous series. Body dimensions remained complaint within the limits of the \"number five\" category, and standard- and high-roof heights were on offer. Noah passenger models had three-row seating with either six, seven, or eight occupant positions\u2014made up by having either three rows of two [[bucket seat]]s, two rows of buckets and third-row [[bench seat]], or buckets up front and benches for the two back rows. A flat floor allowed for walk-through access between the rows.\n\nVans were supplied with several gasoline engines, including the 1486&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#5K|5K]]'' (discontinued in July 2002) and two 1781&nbsp;cc units, the ''[[Toyota K engine#7K|7K]]'' and ''[[Toyota K engine#7K-E|7K-E]]''. Diesel options were the 1974&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#2C|2C]]'' until June 1999 and after this, the 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-E|3C-E]]''. Powertrain options for the Noah twins comprised either the gasoline 1998 cc ''[[Toyota S engine#3S-FE|3S-FE]]'' good for {{convert|130|PS|kW|abbr=on}} or [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] diesel 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-T|3C-T]]'' with {{convert|91|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Transmission were either a five-speed manual with a floor shifter or a column-mounted four-speed automatic.\n\nIn January 1998, there were minor improvements, including a [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]] that became optional for the Noah, and an increase in performance of diesel engines. In December 1998, the Noah passenger models were facelifted with reshaped headlamps, new grilles and front [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]], plus clear turn signal lamps for the tail-lamps and revised wheel trims. Vans were facelifted in June 1999 with new grilles and clear turn signal new tail-lamps. In November 2001, production of the LiteAce Noah and TownAce Noah models ended in favor of the new [[Toyota Noah]]/[[Toyota Voxy|Voxy]]. Diesel engines were discontinued in August 2004 as they did not comply with emissions standards. Vans were again facelifted in July 2005, with [[wing mirror|fender mirrors]] added in conjunction with the existing door-mounted [[wing mirror]]s. This series was manufactured at the Honsha plant [[Toyota, Aichi]] until December 2001, before switching to a Toyota Auto Body plant in January 2002 until end of manufacture in July 2007.\n{{anchor|KR42R}}\n;Export\nToyota Australia offered the KR42R series TownAce commercial vans from January 1997 to 2003, with a 1999 facelift.

These vehicles originally utilized the [[cab over|cab-over-engine]] configuration, although since 1996 a semi-cab-over arrangement has featured instead. The LiteAce launched in 1970 as light-duty truck, with [[commercial vehicle|commercial]] and [[van]]/[[minivan|wagon]] body variants added in 1971. In 1976, Toyota released the larger TownAce van/wagon that derived from the LiteAce; a TownAce truck arrived later in 1978. Between 1982 and 1992, the series accommodated the '''MasterAce Surf'''\u2014an upscale TownAce passenger wagon.\n\nThe two model lines existed separately until 1982 when TownAce trucks became rebadged LiteAce trucks\u2014then in 1992 LiteAce vans became rebranded TownAce vans\u2014thus unifying the once separate vehicle lines. In Japan, the LiteAce retailed at ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Auto Store]]'' dealerships, with the TownAce sold at ''Toyota Corolla Store'' dealerships. The LiteAce and TownAce have been commonly exported to Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the years, select LiteAce/TownAce models have also been available with [[Daihatsu Delta]] badging in Japan. Originally sold as the Delta 750 based on the LiteAce truck, later versions have been badged Delta Wide and based on the TownAce van. For the final Delta retailed between 1996 and 2001, the \"Wide\" suffix disappeared.\n\nThe LiteAce followed the introduction of the more compact [[Toyota MiniAce|MiniAce]] and larger [[Toyota HiAce#H10|HiAce]] in 1967, acting as an intermediacy between these two models in size and carrying capacity. By the mid-1970s, the MiniAce had been retired and the HiAce had grown, thus creating a void in the market resumed by the TownAce. The \"Ace\" moniker references the [[Toyota Toyoace]] medium-duty truck sold starting 1956. The \"Lite\" in LiteAce refers to its light-duty capability, and the \"Town\" in TownAce alludes to the suitability of the model for urban areas.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class = \"navbox\"\n! colspan = \"92\" | Toyota LiteAce, TownAce, MasterAce timeline (Japan), 1970\u2013present\n|- style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 width = 5% | '''Model'''\n| rowspan = 2 width = 5% | '''Body style'''\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1970s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1980s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 1990s\n| colspan = 20 width = 20% | 2000s\n| colspan = 10 width = 20% | 2010s\n|- style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\"\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 5 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 6 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 7 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 8 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 9\n| colspan = 2 width = 2% | 0 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 1 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 2 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 3 || colspan = 2 width = 2% | 4\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | LiteAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 3 |\n| colspan = 16 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M10|M10]]\n| colspan = 12 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 13 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M30|M30/M40]]\n| colspan = 9 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20 rebodied|R20/R30 rebodied]]\n| colspan = 22 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R40|R40/R50]]\n| colspan = 2 rowspan = 4 |\n| colspan = 13 rowspan = 4 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#S400|S400]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Truck\n| colspan = 1 |\n| colspan = 18 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M10|M10]]\n| colspan = 14 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 42 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M50|M50/M60/M70/M80]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| rowspan = 2 style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | TownAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 13 |\n| colspan = 12 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R10|R10]]\n| colspan = 19 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20|R20/R30]]\n| colspan = 9 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20 rebodied|R20/R30 rebodied]]\n| colspan = 22 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R40|R40/R50]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Truck\n| colspan = 17 |\n| colspan = 8 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R10|R10]]\n| colspan = 8 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M20|M20]]\n| colspan = 42 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#M50|M50/M60/M70/M80]]\n|- style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | MasterAce\n| style=\"background:#F0F0F0;\" | Van\n| colspan = 20 |\n| colspan = 5 |\n| colspan = 19 style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" | [[#R20|R20]]\n| colspan = 16 |\n| colspan = 20 |\n| colspan = 10 |\n|-\n| colspan = 92 | <div style=\"background-color:#999999;

In effect, LiteAce filled the gap between the smaller MiniAce and larger [[Toyota HiAce#H10|HiAce]] whilst keeping within [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle size regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement. This meant that buyers would not be liable for additional taxes for a larger vehicle as they were with the HiAce. LiteAce had also been developed following the growing popularity of affordable [[cab over|cab-over-engine trucks]] that could carry up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}. Whereas the MiniAce truck had just a {{convert|500|kg|lb|adj=on}} payload capacity, the LiteAce truck offered {{convert|750|kg|lb}} with a three-seat front [[bench seat|bench]]. The cargo bed was available in high- or low-deck.\n\n{{external media | float = left | width = 300px | image1 = [http://blog-imgs-37-origin.fc2.com/n/o/s/nostalgia1970/liteace_03.jpg 1978\u20131979 LiteAce van (facelift)] | image2 = [http://blog-imgs-27.fc2.com/y/s/m/ysmr631/RSCN3127.jpg 1971\u20131978 Daihatsu Delta 750 (pre-facelift)] | image3 = [https://web.archive.org/web/20140116123441/http://www.nostalgiccar.com/02_zaiko/itaku/it0270/0270.html 1978\u20131979 Daihatsu Delta 750 (facelift)]}}\n\nToyota later released a [[three-box styling|one-box]] van/wagon version of the LiteAce in February 1971. Initially featuring just a single sliding door on the passenger side (curbside), the van/wagon was offered in three seating configurations, of one, two, and three rows\u2014providing for three (van), six (van), and nine (wagon) passengers, respectively. A five-door, dual sliding door version arrived in September 1973 as an option, along with a new high-roof wagon model. The nine-seater wagon was retired in 1975 as it did not satisfy new Japanese [[emission standards]]. Later in October 1976, the [[#R10|TownAce (R10)]] was released\u2014a larger model heavily based on the M10 series LiteAce.\n\nDesign-wise, the front-end was distinguished by vertical, black resin grilles above each [[headlamp]]. A single chrome recess held both the lamp and the black panel in place; this extended from the [[windshield]] to just above the [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]]. The van/wagon featured a top-hinged back door, and ornate resin panels were placed above the [[automotive lighting#Rear position lamps (tail lamps)|tail lamps]] in accordance to the similar design upfront.\n\nThe LiteAce was designated KM10 when fitted with the 1166&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K]]'' [[inline-four engine]] producing {{convert|68|PS|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{citation | script-title = ja:\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8 |trans-title=Toyota Auto | type = catalog | language = Japanese | publisher = Toyota Motor Corporation | date = June 1977 | page = 12 | id = 041183-5206}}</ref> In February 1978, this was replaced by the larger 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K-J]]'' engine (KM11). At the same time, there was a small facelift including a design change to panels above the headlamps and new badging.\n\n;Daihatsu Delta 750\nThis model (truck only) was also marketed in a slightly different [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] form as the [[Daihatsu Delta|Daihatsu Delta 750]] (D10 series) from March 1971. Still with the ''3K'' engine (and the chassis code KD10), this received a small front [[grille (motor vehicle)|grille]] and other detail differences and was available with most of the same bodywork as the LiteAce.<ref>{{cite journal | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af [1976/1977 Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book] | language = Japanese | location = Japan | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | volume = 23 | pages = 211\u2013212 | date = 1976-10-20 | id = 0053-760023-3400}}</ref> As per the donor Toyota, this was later updated in 1978 to the ''4K-J'' engine (and now receiving the KD11 chassis code).

Widely exported for the first time, the M20 included seating for up to eight in the wagon with a 2/3/3 arrangement, including fully reclining seatbacks for the second and third rows. Options included dual-zone air conditioners, a four-speaker audio system, and aluminum wheels. The high-roof GXL wagon grade also offered a [[sunroof|moonroof]] option. Truck versions now included a \"just low\" model\u2014created by fitting 10-inch double tires to the rear wheels (as opposed to 13-inch for the front wheels) to lower the bed floor further.\n\nToyota fitted the 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K-J]]'' inline-four engine (designated KM20 with this engine) with {{convert|69|PS|kW|abbr=on}} to the van and truck initially, with the wagon receiving the 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#13T-U|13T-U]]'' inline-four (TM20) good for {{convert|92|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Both engines were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Updates to the wagon in December 1980 brought an optional three-speed automatic or five-speed manual as well. Further to these revisions, a flagship FXV grade joined the range and new second row seats with a swivel function to face either the forward or backwards position became optional in the wagon. In 1981, a \"handy-cab\" version that could accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair was introduced. A Montana package arrived in January 1982, complete with removable [[bunk bed|loft beds]] and electric curtains. Simultaneously, an eight-seat version with rear-facing second-row seats was introduced (being a 2/3/3 configuration). Then in April 1982, a medium roof height body variant with a twin moonroof was introduced.\n\n{{external media | float = left | image1 = [http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/11882111664_986c90e4c2_o.jpg 1979\u20131982 Daihatsu Delta 750]}}\n\nMinor changes to the M20 series LiteAce arrived for November 1982, including a front-end facelift and the adoption of [[power steering]]. The van gained the option of a 1626&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#1Y|1Y]]'' (YM20) engine with {{convert|84|PS|kW|abbr=on}}.

Dimensionally, body width increased at the expense of length. Improvements to stability and ride comfort were courtesy of an overhauled rear suspension type from a semi-elliptical [[leaf spring]] design to a four-link type with a [[Panhard rod]]. Further improvements were made by switching to [[rack and pinion]] steering.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Toyota Liteace Van 001.JPG\n| caption1 = 1985\u20131988 LiteAce van DX 4WD\n| image2 = Toyota Liteace Wagon 003.JPG\n| caption2 = 1988\u20131991 LiteAce wagon GXL (CM30G)\n}}\n\nThe interior was designed so that the driver's seating position was virtually the same as in a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. Seating options included standard first rows on the cargo van, plus second-row positions on the wagon (five- or six-seater) and optional third-row seats that could be stowed sideways to for additional luggage space. Select trims levels heralded a fully reclining driver's seat and with some, the second-row seats could be turned three-ways (forward, sideways, and backward).\n\nThe engine is reached through a small hatch beneath the front seat; this does not open very wide and the limited access came in for some complaint.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wren | first = Tim | date = June 1986 | title = Light Match | journal = Truck | location = London | publisher = FF Publishing | page = 79}}</ref> Engines fitted to the van/wagon included the 1486&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#5K-U|5K-U]]'' ({{convert|70|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and 1812&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#2Y-U|2Y-U]]'' ({{convert|79|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) gasoline engines and two 1974&nbsp;cc diesels\u2014the ''[[Toyota C engine#2C|2C]]'' ({{convert|70|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] ''[[Toyota C engine#2C-T|2C-T]]'' ({{convert|82|PS|kW|disp=or|abbr=on}}). In October 1985, a part-time [[four-wheel drive]] model was added to the model lineup.\n\nTruck variants of the third generation LiteAce and TownAce launched in October 1986, designated M50/M60/M70/M80. These came installed with the 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota Y engine#3Y-U|3Y-U]]'' gasoline engine or the ''2C'' diesel. TownAce trucks were sold in two levels of trim, the unbadged DX and the more expensive Super X.\n\nIn a minor model change in August 1988, the front and rear of the van/wagon were redesigned, increasing the body length by {{convert|75|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. This facelift was for Japan only. At the same time, [[Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension]] (TEMS) was employed for the first time in a [[three-box styling|one-box]] wagon, and the output of the turbocharged diesel engine was boosted to {{convert|85|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. In September 1989, the new Super SW specification was added, and a five-door version with dual sliding doors could be specified in conjunction with the SW grade. The manual transmission increased from four- to five-gears in August 1990 along with the fitment of a [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|center high mount stop lamp]]. Then in October 1991, the four-wheel drive system became available with the truck body.\n\nAlthough the van/wagon lines were fully redesigned in January 1992 with the [[#R20 rebodied|rebodied R20]] series, the truck line was not renewed until the [[#S400|S400]] series in 2008, leaving the M50/M60/M70/M80 model in production until July 2007. Toyota issued a minor front-end facelift in November 1996 with a redesign of the single-piece plastic panel surrounding both headlamps\u2014this now included the attachment of the modern-day Toyota logo. More substantially updated LiteAce and TownAce trucks were released in June 1999, with the front section of the body and [[dashboard]] thoroughly redesigned\u2014however, the design of the doors and all parts rearward carried over verbatim. The optional four-wheel drive switched from part-time to full-time configuration, [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] were made standard, and [[airbag]]s an option. The gasoline engine was upgraded from to the 1781&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#7K-E|7K-E]]'', and the ''2C'' diesel engine made way for the 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-E|3C-E]]'' which remained in the market until discontinued in August 2004. From December 2004, production switched from the Honsha plant at [[Toyota, Aichi]] to the [[Hamura, Tokyo]] plant operated by the Toyota-owned [[Hino Motors]].\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 200 | height = 150\n| File:1989 Toyota LiteAce (YM30) van (23335655331).jpg|1989 LiteAce van\n| File:Toyota LiteAce FXV (M30).jpg|1988\u20131991 LiteAce wagon FXV\n| File:Toyota Liteace Truck 001.JPG|1986\u20131996 LiteAce truck \"just low\"\n| File:Town Ace with Wireframe Cargo Back.jpg|1986\u20131996 TownAce truck DX\n| File:Toyota Townace Truuk 001.JPG|1986\u20131996 TownAce truck Super X\n| File:Toyota Townace Truuk 003.JPG|1996\u20131999 TownAce truck DX\n| File:Toyota Liteace Truck 005.JPG|1999\u20132007 LiteAce truck\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== R-series ==\n\n=== {{anchor|R10}} 1976\u20131982 (R10) TownAce van/truck ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = R10\n| image = Toyota Town Ace Wagon 001.JPG\n| caption = 1978 TownAce wagon Custom Extra (TR15; pre-facelift)\n| aka = [[Daihatsu Delta|Daihatsu Delta Wide]] (B10)\n| production = {{ubl\n  | October 1976 \u2013 October 1982 (van/wagon)\n  | September 1978 \u2013 October 1982 (truck)\n  }}\n| assembly = Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] (Honsha plant)\n| body_style = {{ubl\n  | 2-door truck\n  | 4-door van/wagon\n  }}\n| layout = [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related = [[#M10|Toyota LiteAce (M10)]]\n| engine = {{ubl\n  | 1166&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K-J]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]] (gasoline)\n  | 1290&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#4K-J|4K-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota R engine#12R|12R-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1588&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T-J]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1588&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#12T|12T]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota T engine#13T|13T-U]]'' I4 (gasoline)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n  | 4-speed manual\n  | 5-speed manual\n  | 5-speed automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|2170|-|2295|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|2195|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| length = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|4110|-|4315|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|3990|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| width = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1650|-|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| height = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1840|-|1860|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|1745|-|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| weight = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1080|-|1135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (truck)\n  | {{convert|965|-|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (van/wagon)\n  }}\n| sp = us\n}}\n\nThe first TownAce (R10 series) made its sales debut in October 1976 as a widened and lengthened version of the [[#M10|LiteAce (M10)]], still using the same doors and some other panels.

While the R20/R30 models were typically discontinued in export markets in 1990 with the release of this new model (usually badged [[Toyota Previa#XR10|Previa]] overseas), for Japan, production continued until January 1992. This was because unlike the R20/R30, the Estima did not fall under the \"number five\" [[tax bracket]] regarding [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle size tax legislation]]. To comply, dimensions had to remain under {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for width and {{convert|4700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, plus 2000&nbsp;cc for engine displacement.

North American markets called it the \"Toyota Van\" (VanWagon in early press materials), while Australia referred to the vehicle as the [[Toyota Tarago]] (named after [[Tarago, New South Wales]]). In parts of Europe it was known as the \"Toyota Space Cruiser\", but in Germany, Sweden, Norway, China and some countries of Latin America it was sold as the \"Toyota Model F\". Export models were partially replaced with the [[Toyota Previa]] in 1990.\n\nNorth American market sales started in 1983 for the 1984 [[model year]] as the \"Toyota Van\" with styling shared with the MasterAce Surf. The 2.0-liter ''3Y-U'' EFI ({{convert|87|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) came at launch, but was replaced with the 2.2-liter ''4Y-E'' engine with {{convert|102|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the 1986 model year facelift. Rear-wheel drive versions were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1989, while four-wheel drive models were sold between 1987 and 1989. The four-wheel drive models came with skid plates, with manual transmission models including a [[transfer case]] with low and high ranges (automatic models lacked a low range).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Toyota minivans: Van, Previa, and Sienna | url = http://www.toyoland.com/trucks/minivans.html | work = ToyoLand | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The Real Owners Manual | url = http://yotavans.org/community/tips/real_manual.html#trans | work = Toyota Van Community Site | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}</ref> All trim levels starting in 1986 had a [[Automotive lighting#Cornering lamps|cornering lamp]] system.

Deluxe and LE (Limited Edition) versions were offered as well as an ice maker/refrigerator between the front seats. The Van also offered dual air conditioning, captains chairs (LE for the 1986 to 1989 model years), twin [[sunroof]]s, digital clock, satellite radio controls (LE for the 1987 to 1989 model years), fog lights (LE for the 1986 to 1989 model years with power window package), tachometer, power locks, power windows, and a tinted glass privacy package. LE models had color matched bumpers and front grille along with power mirrors, chrome headlight bezels, and chrome Toyota emblems. Base models came with black bumpers and grill with white Toyota emblems. Base models have the reverse lights incorporated into the tail light assembly whereas the LE models had them incorporated into the rear hatch. In 1986, a special [[EXPO86]] version was available in Canada only. The 1986 model year Espirit model was finished in a unique light blue color with a white wave pattern on the lower half on the side profile.

Thus, from this time, the entire LiteAce and TownAce range (van and truck) were unified. The rebodied R20/R30 had a much more streamlined design. The LiteAce and TownAce commercial vans were very similar, differing by the TownAce receiving extra headlamps adjacent inside to the main units and a small air [[intake]] slit. The LiteAce did not have this intake, but instead had additional grilles where the extra lamps in the TownAce were. Passenger wagons of both models had different styling again. Here, the LiteAce front end featured two separate headlamp units that tapered inwards towards the Toyota logo. TownAce wagons had headlamps that sat flush with a translucent garnish that gave the appearance of a large, single headlamp. Rear styling also differed between the commercial vans and passenger wagons, although both models used the same rear-end regardless if badged LiteAce or TownAce.\n\nToyota Australia released the TownAce commercial van in April 1992.

Offered in van/wagon configurations only, the [[van]] sold as the LiteAce and TownAce, with [[minivan|wagon]]s now designated LiteAce Noah and TownAce Noah and fitted with a different, more luxurious interior. As with previous generation, LiteAce and TownAce were differentiated by their front [[grille]] designs. Vans were badged DX (for cargo purposes) and GL (dual purpose). Noah models received standard [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional twin [[sunroof|moonroofs]] (the Skylite roof was discontinued).\n\nTo meet new occupant safety regulations, the [[cab over|cab-over]], [[mid-engine design|mid-mounted engine]] was moved in front of the passenger compartment (semi-cab-over), giving the car an all-new look, although a move inline with the vehicle's competitors. Despite the trend among its Japanese competitors of switching to the [[front-wheel drive]] layout, the R40/R50 maintained its rear-wheel drive. Full-time four-wheel drive was optional, replacing the part-time configuration from the previous series. Body dimensions remained complaint within the limits of the \"number five\" category, and standard- and high-roof heights were on offer. Noah passenger models had three-row seating with either six, seven, or eight occupant positions\u2014made up by having either three rows of two [[bucket seat]]s, two rows of buckets and third-row [[bench seat]], or buckets up front and benches for the two back rows. A flat floor allowed for walk-through access between the rows.\n\nVans were supplied with several gasoline engines, including the 1486&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota K engine#5K|5K]]'' (discontinued in July 2002) and two 1781&nbsp;cc units, the ''[[Toyota K engine#7K|7K]]'' and ''[[Toyota K engine#7K-E|7K-E]]''. Diesel options were the 1974&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#2C|2C]]'' until June 1999 and after this, the 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-E|3C-E]]''. Powertrain options for the Noah twins comprised either the gasoline 1998 cc ''[[Toyota S engine#3S-FE|3S-FE]]'' good for {{convert|130|PS|kW|abbr=on}} or [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] diesel 2184&nbsp;cc ''[[Toyota C engine#3C-T|3C-T]]'' with {{convert|91|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Transmission were either a five-speed manual with a floor shifter or a column-mounted four-speed automatic.\n\nIn January 1998, there were minor improvements, including a [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]] that became optional for the Noah, and an increase in performance of diesel engines. In December 1998, the Noah passenger models were facelifted with reshaped headlamps, new grilles and front [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]], plus clear turn signal lamps for the tail-lamps and revised wheel trims. Vans were facelifted in June 1999 with new grilles and clear turn signal new tail-lamps. In November 2001, production of the LiteAce Noah and TownAce Noah models ended in favor of the new [[Toyota Noah]]/[[Toyota Voxy|Voxy]]. Diesel engines were discontinued in August 2004 as they did not comply with emissions standards. Vans were again facelifted in July 2005, with [[wing mirror|fender mirrors]] added in conjunction with the existing door-mounted [[wing mirror]]s. This series was manufactured at the Honsha plant [[Toyota, Aichi]] until December 2001, before switching to a Toyota Auto Body plant in January 2002 until end of manufacture in July 2007.\n{{anchor|KR42R}}\n;Export\nToyota Australia offered the KR42R series TownAce commercial vans from January 1997 to 2003, with a 1999 facelift.

They may be no more than six years from completion of the most recent Ph.D. or equivalent as of the year of their nomination, unless special circumstances such as military service, a change of field, or child rearing are involved or unless they have held a faculty appointment for less than two years. If any of the above circumstances apply, the letter of nomination (see below) should provide a clear explanation. While Fellows are expected to be at an early stage of their research careers, there should be strong evidence of independent research accomplishments. Candidates in all fields are normally below the rank of associate professor and do not hold tenure, but these are not strict requirements. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation welcomes nominations of all candidates who meet the traditional high standards of the program, and strongly encourages the participation of women and members of underrepresented minority groups.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Award recipients ==\nSince the beginning of the program in 1955, 43 fellows have won a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Prize,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Nobel Laureates|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127182945/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|archivedate = 2016-01-27}}</ref> and 16 have won the [[Fields Medal]] in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fields Medalists|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120908235152/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2012-09-08|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==== Sloan Fellowship recipients who became Nobel or Fields Medal laureates ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Name\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Field{{#tag:ref|Field of the Sloan fellowship|group=\"n\"}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Sloan year\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Prize year{{#tag:ref|Unless stated, the prize was awarded in the same field as that of the Sloan fellowship|group=\"n\"}}\n|-\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Feynman\" |[[Richard Feynman]]|| Physics || 1955 || 1965\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Gell-Mann\" |[[Murray Gell-Mann]]|| Physics || 1957 || 1969\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Cooper\" |[[Leon N.

They may be no more than six years from completion of the most recent Ph.D. or equivalent as of the year of their nomination, unless special circumstances such as military service, a change of field, or child rearing are involved or unless they have held a faculty appointment for less than two years. If any of the above circumstances apply, the letter of nomination (see below) should provide a clear explanation. While Fellows are expected to be at an early stage of their research careers, there should be strong evidence of independent research accomplishments. Candidates in all fields are normally below the rank of associate professor and do not hold tenure, but these are not strict requirements. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation welcomes nominations of all candidates who meet the traditional high standards of the program, and strongly encourages the participation of women and members of underrepresented minority groups.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Award recipients ==\nSince the beginning of the program in 1955, 43 fellows have won a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Prize,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Nobel Laureates|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127182945/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|archivedate = 2016-01-27}}</ref> and 16 have won the [[Fields Medal]] in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fields Medalists|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120908235152/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2012-09-08|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==== Sloan Fellowship recipients who became Nobel or Fields Medal laureates ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Name\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Field{{#tag:ref|Field of the Sloan fellowship|group=\"n\"}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Sloan year\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Prize year{{#tag:ref|Unless stated, the prize was awarded in the same field as that of the Sloan fellowship|group=\"n\"}}\n|-\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Feynman\" |[[Richard Feynman]]|| Physics || 1955 || 1965\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Gell-Mann\" |[[Murray Gell-Mann]]|| Physics || 1957 || 1969\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Cooper\" |[[Leon N.
