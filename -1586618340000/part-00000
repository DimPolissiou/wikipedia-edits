The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.  The houses are set high above the roadside.  A grass slope is visible to the lower left of the image, and a tall brick wall to the lower right.  A gap in the centre of the image indicates the absence of a single house|The empty plot where 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in [[Hattersley]] once stood.  Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house.]]\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to [[Manchester Central railway station]], where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim.  After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;... Ian had a hatchet in his hand&nbsp;... he was holding it above his head and he hit the lad on the left side of his head with the hatchet.

Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=17\u201319|ps=none}}  Various authors have stated that he [[zoosadism|tortured animals]], although Brady objected to such accusations.{{sfnp|Cowley|2011|p=28|ps=none}}  Aged nine, he visited [[Loch Lomond]] with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new [[council house]] on an [[overspill estate]] at [[Pollok]].  He was accepted for [[Shawlands Academy]], a school for above-average pupils.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nAt Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and took a job as a tea boy at a [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Govan]]. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a [[flick knife]] after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=20\u201321|ps=none}} and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=24|ps=none}} By then, she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick Brady got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick Brady's surname.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=122|ps=none}}\n\nWithin a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.

Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.

After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.

Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;...

Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].  On one of these occasions, Hindley found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody, being charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at [[Risley (HM Prison)|Risley]].{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}}\n\nPolice searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name \"John Kilbride\", which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the disappearances of other youngsters.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=33|ps=none}} Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had \"only done what she had been told\".{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=122|ps=none}} Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as \"dodgy books\", which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady \"had a thing about railway stations\".

In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14&nbsp;years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police.

Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=17\u201319|ps=none}}  Various authors have stated that he [[zoosadism|tortured animals]], although Brady objected to such accusations.{{sfnp|Cowley|2011|p=28|ps=none}}  Aged nine, he visited [[Loch Lomond]] with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new [[council house]] on an [[overspill estate]] at [[Pollok]].  He was accepted for [[Shawlands Academy]], a school for above-average pupils.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nAt Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and took a job as a tea boy at a [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Govan]]. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a [[flick knife]] after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=20\u201321|ps=none}} and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=24|ps=none}} By then, she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick Brady got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick Brady's surname.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=122|ps=none}}\n\nWithin a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.

In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.

The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.

Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.

{"title_page": "Sankore Madrasah", "text_new": "{{short description|Ancient center of learning in Timbuktu, Mali}}\n{{update|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Sankore Moske Timboektoe.JPG|thumb|Sankore Madrasah]]\n\n'''Sankor\u00e9 Madrasah''' (also called the '''University of Sankor\u00e9''', or '''Sankore Masjid''') is one of three ancient centers of learning located in [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]. The three [[mosque]]s of Sankor\u00e9, [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]] and [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] compose the [[University of Timbuktu]]. Madrasah (\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629) means school/university in Arabic and also in other languages that have been influenced by Islam.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fortier 368 Timbuktu Sankore Mosque.jpg|thumb|Postcard published by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Edmond Fortier|Edmond Fortier]] showing the mosque in 1905-06]] \nThe University of Sankore has its roots in the Sankore Mosque which was founded in 989 AD by [[Al-Qadi Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar]], the Supreme Judge of Timbuktu. The Sankore University prospered and became a very significant seat of learning in the Muslim world, especially under the reign of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]] (1307\u20131332) and the Askia Dynasty (1493\u20131591).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woods |first=Michael |title=Seven Wonders of Ancient Africa |page=61 |publisher=Lerner |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7613-4320-2 }}</ref>\n\n===Growth as a center of learning===\n\nTimbuktu had long been a destination or stop for merchants from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It wasn't long before ideas as well as merchandise began passing through the fabled city. Since most if not all these traders were [[Muslim]], the mosque would see visitors constantly. The temple accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world becoming not only a center of worship but a center of learning. Books became more valuable than any other commodity in the city, and private libraries sprouted up in the homes of local scholars.\n\n===Apex===\n\nBy the end of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]]'s reign (early 14th century CE), the Sankor\u00e9 Masjid had been converted into a fully staffed [[Madrassa]] (Islamic school or in this case university) with the largest collections of books in Africa since the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The level of learning at Timbuktu's Sankor\u00e9 University was superior to that of many other Islamic centers in the world. The Sankor\u00e9 Masjid was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with between 400,000 and 700,000 manuscripts.<ref>See {{cite book |editor-first=Said |editor-last=Hamdun |editor2-first=No\u00ebl |editor2-last=King |title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa |location=London |publisher=Rex Collins |year=1975 |isbn=0-901720-57-7 |pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAs the center of an [[Islam]]ic scholarly community, the University was very different in organization from the universities of [[medieval]] [[Europe]]. It had no central administration other than the Emperor. It had no student registers but kept copies of its students' publishing. It was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or [[imam]]. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyard of the mosque or at private residences.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum of Sankor\u00e9 and other masjids in the area had four levels of schooling or \"degrees\". On graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their mastery. The schooling was not secular as arguments that could not be backed by the [[Qur'an]] were inadmissible in debates.  However, secular teaching ([[geometry]], [[mathematics]]) were included and stressed to develop well-rounded individuals.\n\n===Qur'anic School===\nThe first or primary degree (Qur'anic school) required a mastery of [[Arabic]] and certain African languages and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur'an.  Students were also introduced to basic sciences at this level.\n\n===General Studies===\nThe secondary degree or General Studies degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences.  Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learnings of the Qur'an.  At this level they learned ''Hadiths'', jurisprudence and the sciences of spiritual purification according to Islam.  Finally, they began an introduction to trade school and business ethics. On graduation day, students were given turbans symbolizing Divine light, wisdom, knowledge and excellent moral conduct. After receiving their diplomas the students would gather outside the examination building or the main campus library and throw their turbans high into the air cheering and holding each other's hands to show that they were all brothers and sisters.<ref>See {{cite journal |first=S\u00e9k\u00e9n\u00e9 Mody |last=Cissoko |title=L\u2019intelligentsia de Tombouctou aux 15e et 16e si\u00e8cles |journal=[[Pr\u00e9sence Africaine]] |volume=72 |year=1969 |pages=48\u201372 |postscript=, }} and {{cite book |first=Jean-Louis |last=Triaud |title=Islam et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soudanaises au Moyen-\u00c2ge: \u00c9tude historique |series=\u00c9tdues volta\u00efques |volume=vol. 16 |location=Paris \u2013 Adidjan \u2013 Niamey |year=1973 |pages=167 sq. }}</ref>\n\n===Superior Degree===\nThe Superior degree required students to study under specialized professors doing research work.  Much of the learning centered on debates to philosophic or religious questions.  Before graduating from this level, students attached themselves to a Sheik (Islamic teacher) and demonstrated a strong character.\n\n===Alumni Level===\nThe last level of learning at Sankor\u00e9 or any of the Masjids was the level of Judge or Professor.  These men worked mainly as judges for the city and eventually the region dispersing learned men to all the principal cities in Mali.  A third level student who had impressed his Sheik enough was admitted into a \"circle of knowledge\" and valued as a truly learned individual and expert in his field.  The members of this scholar's club were the equivalent of tenured professors.

The three [[mosque]]s of Sankor\u00e9, [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]] and [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] compose the [[University of Timbuktu]]. Madrasah (\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629) means school/university in Arabic and also in other languages that have been influenced by Islam.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fortier 368 Timbuktu Sankore Mosque.jpg|thumb|Postcard published by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Edmond Fortier|Edmond Fortier]] showing the mosque in 1905-06]] \nThe University of Sankore has its roots in the Sankore Mosque which was founded in 989 AD by [[Al-Qadi Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar]], the Supreme Judge of Timbuktu. The Sankore University prospered and became a very significant seat of learning in the Muslim world, especially under the reign of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]] (1307\u20131332) and the Askia Dynasty (1493\u20131591).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woods |first=Michael |title=Seven Wonders of Ancient Africa |page=61 |publisher=Lerner |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7613-4320-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Growth as a center of learning==\nTimbuktu had long been a destination or stop for merchants from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It wasn't long before ideas as well as merchandise began passing through the fabled city. Since most if not all these traders were [[Muslim]], the mosque would see visitors constantly. The temple accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world becoming not only a center of worship but a center of learning. Books became more valuable than any other commodity in the city, and private libraries sprouted up in the homes of local scholars.\n\n==Apex==\n\nBy the end of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]]'s reign (early 14th century CE), the Sankor\u00e9 Masjid had been converted into a fully staffed [[Madrassa]] (Islamic school or in this case university) with the largest collections of books in Africa since the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The level of learning at Timbuktu's Sankor\u00e9 University was superior to that of many other Islamic centers in the world. The Sankor\u00e9 Masjid was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with between 400,000 and 700,000 manuscripts.<ref>See {{cite book |editor-first=Said |editor-last=Hamdun |editor2-first=No\u00ebl |editor2-last=King |title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa |location=London |publisher=Rex Collins |year=1975 |isbn=0-901720-57-7 |pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAs the center of an [[Islam]]ic scholarly community, the University was very different in organization from the universities of [[medieval]] [[Europe]]. It had no central administration other than the Emperor. It had no student registers but kept copies of its students' publishing. It was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or [[imam]]. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyard of the mosque or at private residences.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum of Sankor\u00e9 and other masjids in the area had four levels of schooling or \"degrees\". On graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their mastery. The schooling was not secular as arguments that could not be backed by the [[Qur'an]] were inadmissible in debates.  However, secular teaching ([[geometry]], [[mathematics]]) were included and stressed to develop well-rounded individuals.\n\n===Qur'anic School===\nThe first or primary degree (Qur'anic school) required a mastery of [[Arabic]] and certain African languages and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur'an.  Students were also introduced to basic sciences at this level.\n\n===General Studies===\nThe secondary degree or General Studies degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences.  Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learnings of the Qur'an.  At this level they learned ''Hadiths'', jurisprudence and the sciences of spiritual purification according to Islam.  Finally, they began an introduction to trade school and business ethics. On graduation day, students were given turbans symbolizing Divine light, wisdom, knowledge and excellent moral conduct. After receiving their diplomas the students would gather outside the examination building or the main campus library and throw their turbans high into the air cheering and holding each other's hands to show that they were all brothers and sisters.<ref>See {{cite journal |first=S\u00e9k\u00e9n\u00e9 Mody |last=Cissoko |title=L\u2019intelligentsia de Tombouctou aux 15e et 16e si\u00e8cles |journal=[[Pr\u00e9sence Africaine]] |volume=72 |year=1969 |pages=48\u201372 |postscript=, }} and {{cite book |first=Jean-Louis |last=Triaud |title=Islam et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soudanaises au Moyen-\u00c2ge: \u00c9tude historique |series=\u00c9tdues volta\u00efques |volume=vol. 16 |location=Paris \u2013 Adidjan \u2013 Niamey |year=1973 |pages=167 sq. }}</ref>\n\n===Superior Degree===\nThe Superior degree required students to study under specialized professors doing research work.  Much of the learning centered on debates to philosophic or religious questions.  Before graduating from this level, students attached themselves to a Sheik (Islamic teacher) and demonstrated a strong character.\n\n===Alumni Level===\nThe last level of learning at Sankor\u00e9 or any of the Masjids was the level of Judge or Professor.  These men worked mainly as judges for the city and eventually the region dispersing learned men to all the principal cities in Mali.  A third level student who had impressed his Sheik enough was admitted into a \"circle of knowledge\" and valued as a truly learned individual and expert in his field.  The members of this scholar's club were the equivalent of tenured professors. Those who did not leave Timbuktu remained there to teach or counsel the leading people of the region on important legal and religious matters. They would receive questions from the region's powerful (kings or governors) and distribute them to the third level students as research assignments.  After discussing the findings among themselves, the scholars would issue a fatwa on the best way to deal with the problem at hand.\n\n==Scholars of Sankor\u00e9 ==\nScholars wrote their own books as part of a [[socioeconomic]] model.
