The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Touring Plans|title=Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry|url=https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#|author=Bob Sehlinger}}</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|author=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref>{{cite web|website=Lost Epcot|title=\"Cranium Command\" photos|url=http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html|author=Unknown admin}}</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Hill|title=Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx|date=June 8, 2004}}</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|author=Drew Taylor|title=Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref>{{cite web|website=/Film|title=Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/|author=Angie Han|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition. A number of animatronic elements including Buzzy were marked by the Walt Disney archives for preservation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sonswa |first1=Matt |title=Disney Cranium Command Epcot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrOPmotqGCY&t |website=YouTube |publisher=MattSonswa |accessdate= 3 February 2019}}</ref> Cranium Command subsequently became an increasingly popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Wonders of Life pavilion, including the Cranium Command show building, will be repurposed as a new pavilion entitled [[Play!]].

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|author=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref>{{cite web|website=Lost Epcot|title=\"Cranium Command\" photos|url=http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html|author=Unknown admin}}</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Hill|title=Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx|date=June 8, 2004}}</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|author=Drew Taylor|title=Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes.

In the monastic tradition of all schools of Buddhism the [[Vinaya]] expounds the vows of the fully ordained Nuns and Monks. \n\nIn the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, such public vows are made by the religious \u2013 [[Cenobium|cenobitic]] and [[Hermit|eremitic]] \u2013 of the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the [[evangelical counsels]] of poverty, chastity, and obedience or [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine]] equivalent. The vows are regarded as the individual's free response to a call by God to follow [[Jesus Christ]] more closely under the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] in a particular form of [[Christian monasticism|religious living]]. A person who lives a religious life according to vows they have made is called a ''votary'' or a ''votarist''. The religious vow, being a public vow, is binding in [[Church law]]. One of its effects is that the person making it ceases to be free to marry. In the Catholic Church, by joining the consecrated life, one does not become a member of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]] but becomes a member of a state of life which is neither [[Catholic Church hierarchy#The Clergy|clerical]] nor [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Laity|lay]], the consecrated state.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1X.HTM 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 588]</ref> Nevertheless, the members of the religious orders and those hermits who are in [[Holy Orders]] are members of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060826234244/http://uk.geocities.com/deo_auxiliante@btinternet.com/churchchart.html  Chart showing the place of those making religious vows among the People of God]</ref>\n\n== In the Western Church ==\nSince the 6th century, [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s following the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] have been making the Benedictine vow at their public [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profession]] of obedience (placing oneself under the direction of the abbot/abbess or prior/prioress), stability (committing oneself to a particular monastery), and \"conversion of manners\" (which includes forgoing private ownership and celibate chastity).<ref>Rule of St Benedict, ch. 58:17.</ref>\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries [[mendicant orders]] emerged, such as the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], whose vocation emphasizing mobility and flexibility required them to drop the concept of \"stability\". They therefore [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profess]] ''chastity, poverty and obedience'', like the members of many other orders and religious congregations founded subsequently. The public [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profession]] of these [[evangelical counsels]] (or [[counsels of perfection]]), confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, are now a requirement according to modern Church Law.<ref>In the Roman Catholic Church, see canons 573, 603 and 654 of the Code of Canon Law 1983; only the Benedictines continue to make the equivalent Benedictine vow.</ref>\n\nThe \"clerks regular\" of the 16th century and after, such as the [[Jesuits]] and [[Redemptorists]], followed this same general format, though some added a \"[[fourth vow]]\", indicating some special apostolate or attitude within the order. Fully professed Jesuits (known as \"the professed of the fourth vow\" within the order), take a vow of particular obedience to the [[Pope]] to undertake any mission laid out in their Formula of the Institute. The [[Missionaries of Charity]], founded by [[St. Teresa of Calcutta]] centuries later (1940s), are another example of this, in that her sisters take a fourth vow of special service to \"the poorest of the poor\".\n\n=== In the Catholic Church  ===\n{{canon law}}\n{{main|Consecrated life (Catholic Church)}}\n{{see also|Solemn vow}}\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the vows of members of religious orders and congregations are regulated by canons 654-658 of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]. These are public vows, meaning vows accepted by a superior in the name of the Church,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 \u00a72]</ref> and they are usually of two durations: temporary, and, after a few years, final vows (permanent or \"perpetual\"). Depending on the order, temporary vows may be renewed a number of times before permission to take final vows is given. There are exceptions: the [[Jesuits]]' first vows are perpetual, for instance, and the [[Sisters of Charity]] take only temporary but renewable vows.\n\nReligious vows are of two varieties: [[simple vows]] and [[solemn vows]]. The highest level of commitment is exemplified by those who have taken their solemn, perpetual vows. There once were significant technical differences between them in [[canon law]]; but these differences were suppressed by the current [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] in 1983, although the nominal distinction is maintained. Only a limited number of religious congregations may invite their members to solemn vows; most religious congregations are only authorized to take simple vows. Even in congregations with solemn vows, some members with perpetual vows may have taken them simply rather than solemnly.\n\nA perpetual vow can be superseded by the Pope, when he decides that a man under perpetual vows should become a Bishop of the Church. In these cases, the ties to the order the new Bishop had, are dissolved as if the Bishop had never been a member; hence, such a person as [[Pope Francis]], for example, has had no formal ties to his old order for years. However, if the Bishop was a member in good standing, he will be regarded, informally, as \"one of us\", and he will always be welcome in any of the order's houses.\n\nThere are other forms of [[consecrated life]] in the Catholic Church for men and women. They make a public profession of the [[evangelical counsels]] of chastity, poverty, and obedience, confirmed by a vow or other sacred bond, regulated by [[canon law]] but live consecrated lives in the world (i.e. not as members of a [[religious institute]]). Such are the [[secular institute]]s, the [[Hermit#Consecrated diocesan hermits (canon 603)|hermits]] and the [[consecrated virgin]]s (canon 604) These make a public profession of the evangelical counsels by a vow or other sacred bond.

Previously, one would simply find a [[Hesychasm|spiritual father]] and live under his direction. Once one put on the monastic habit, it was understood that one had made a lifetime commitment to God and would remain steadfast in it to the end. Over time, however, the formal Tonsure and taking of vows was adopted to impress upon the monastic the seriousness of the commitment to the ascetic life he or she was adopting.\n\nThe vows taken by Orthodox monks are: Chastity, poverty, obedience, and stability. The vows are administered by the [[Hegumen|Abbot]] or [[Hieromonk]] who performs the service.  Following a period of instruction and testing as a novice, a monk or nun may be tonsured with the permission of the candidate's spiritual father.

For example, he conducts his own surveillance of Lonnie Rodiger, a young pedophile whom he correctly suspected of murdering young boys, including the younger brother of his high school girlfriend Allie. In the [[Chicago P.D. (season 2)#ep22|season 2 crossover]] with ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', when Will was called in for questioning by Sergeant Benson from the NYPD SVU and Voight as Will knew a victim, Halstead storms into Voight's office and tells them that they will get a written statement from Will and nothing more. Likewise, in season 6, he disobeyed Voight's order to stay on desk duty upon hearing that the fire his father died in was an arson and continued to pursue the case by himself.\n\nIn the pilot episode, it is established that Halstead had been partnered with [[Erin Lindsay]] for the past month and they share a close relationship, which has evolved into a more intimate relationship at various times (which they have had to keep secret) but prevented from going any further due to Voight's dislike of \"in-house romances\". She tries to set him up on dates with her friends in the first several episodes of season 1 but soon realizes that she has feelings for him. He was presumably the first person Lindsay had confided her past to, in full detail.

She rescues him in the nick of time and decides to return to Intelligence, where she is again partnered with Halstead. They reconnect and rekindle their relationship.

At the end of the episode \"Fork in the Road\", he was seen making a call to Lindsay to propose to her but it was seen that she did not answer the call. It is later revealed that she was leaving for New York City after a series of incidents from the episode essentially led to her accepting a job there and escape further scrutiny from the CPD.\n\nIn season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he is partnered with Hailey Upton and their partnership continues to be rocky. He is a subject in an investigation and scrutiny from public when a drug deal went wrong. When a young girl was shot during the ordeal (and eventually died at Chicago Med), later on showed that the bullet came from his gun.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", it became known that he is still having nightmares about his tours in Afghanistan. He went undercover to infiltrate a kidnapping crew composed of military veterans and struck up a friendship with Luis Vega, his \"target\", due to their shared background as former Rangers who had been deployed to Afghanistan. When the target is killed, his flashbacks came up causing him to dangerously come close to shooting Upton. During the episode, he gets into a relationship with Camila Vega, Luis's sister. He continues to pose as Ryan and does not reveal his true identity to her.<ref name=\"S05E07\"/>\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", the relationship between Halstead and his new girlfriend Camila takes a dramatic turn when he unintentionally gets himself in the middle of a drug operation and a murder of an undercover DEA agent. He later finds out that Camila is a person of interest. But later in the investigation, she confesses that she was recruiting people to become drug dealers. When Voight sees that Halstead was acting strange, he asks him if he was in a relationship with her, he lied and denied it. But when the sting in getting the murderer to confess falls apart, his colleagues rushes in the garage and as she was getting arrested, she realizes that he was a cop. As she was sitting in a jail cell, Upton convinces Camila to not see Halstead again and to not speak of their relationship to anyone or face spending years in prison. In the following episode \"Confidential\", he was placed on desk duty by Voight and was ordered to see a psychiatrist. He eventually returned to the field and admitted to Upton in the episode \"Chasing Monsters\" that he found therapy helpful and was finally addressing his PTSD.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his new partnership with Upton in season 5, the duo have since become close friends and confidants, often supporting one another after difficult cases.\n\nIn \"Endings\", after his father was declared brain dead, he investigated who the person responsible for the fire. During the investigation, it became known that Daniel Mendoza, a drug cartel member, was the one responsible. When attempting to take his brother Juan Mendoza, into custody, he almost gets into an altercation with him only for Upton and Ruzek to stop him. Voight benches Halstead due to his personal connection to the case. Jay is so enraged by this that he insults Upton's dad, saying she's projecting her own father issues. Upton, being tired of him using her as a punching bag, demanded to hand the keys to her. He calls Severide to give him a radio and a ride. He then takes a radio from a uniformed officer and chases after Daniel on foot, he was shot and wounded by Mendoza who was attempting to evade police. He, in return, shot and killed him. Voight berates him for going against his orders and that their conversation is not over.\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Trigger\", he was visibly affected by the fact that a fellow veteran would frame a local [[imam]] and kill innocent people in a deluded quest to prove that the imam was financially supporting terrorist activity; for the first time on the show, Halstead spoke at length about his time in the military and commented that he had learned to live with his PTSD and move on with life, unlike the perpetrator.<ref name=\"Trigger\"/>\n\nIn \"Outrage\", while working undercover in a drug bust, it went sideways when the team identified the suspect as Matthew Garrett, a perp who Halstead thought was in prison. Jay tried to bail before any trouble started, but Garrett had also recognize him and publicly called him out, leading to a brief confrontation. As he left the club, Jay described the guy as \u201cthe devil.\u201d A paperwork SNAFU led to Garrett getting a huge payoff for wrongful arrest, and now he was using it to fund his drug operation. Halstead particularly hated him because Garrett killed a 17-year-old girl. With Halstead benched by Voight over an official complaint against him, they went ahead of the drug bust. Instead of Garrett, his two henchmen were there. Upon finding out the location, Halstead was the first person through the warehouse door and found Garrett shot in the neck. He died shortly thereafter, leaving Jay without the location of the murdered girl's body. When investigated by Internal Affairs, Voight instructed Halstead to lie and say Garrett died before he got there, instead of in front of him. Kelton along with everyone, was convinced that Halstead was the prime suspect in his murder. Voight goes to his old friend, former Detective Gus for answers, while there, he confesses to murder and tells to look the other way. When he couldn't, he gives him \"some time alone\" in which he committed suicide and Halstead was off the hook.\n\n====Crossovers====\nHalstead first appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a recurring character before becoming a main character on ''[[Chicago PD (TV series)|Chicago PD]]''. Within the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]], the character has crossed-over to ''Fire'' and ''Med'' as part of the CPD investigation. He also appeared on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' to assist with cross-jurisdiction cases.\n\nThe character was introduced in season 2 as a regular customer at Molly's, a bar jointly run by paramedic [[Gabriela Dawson]] and her firefighter colleagues. He had fallen for Gabby but she breaks up with him upon finding out he was a \"henchman\" of Arthur, a local thug who had threatened to burn down Molly's. Although her brother [[Antonio Dawson|Antonio]] tells her that Halstead was actually a cop, Gabby decides to end their relationship, as she had felt betrayed even though she understood that Halstead could not blow his cover. They part on friendly terms after Halstead successfully arrests Arthur and taking a bullet to his shoulder in the process. As a result, he opts out of undercover work and joins Antonio in the Intelligence Unit.<ref name=\"Joyriding\">{{cite episode |title=Joyriding|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|network=[[NBC]]|airdate=November 12, 2013|season=2|number=6}}</ref>\n\nHalstead also appeared in later in the season as the lead detective of a murder case involving Gabby's colleague at Firehouse 51. One of [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]]'s men Jeff Clarke was a suspect when the ex-lover of his wife was found dead. The ex-lover turned out to be a loanshark who repeatedly harassed the Clarkes to the point where Clarke has verbally threatened him and had gone to his house with a sniper rifle intending to kill him. Clarke, an [[Iraq]] veteran, later admitted that he tried to protect his wife because she had been there for him when he came home from his deployment, to which Halstead replied that he understood and could sympathize.\n\nHalstead was a central character in the 2018 crossovers with ''Chicago Fire'' and ''Chicago Med''.<ref name=\"Endings\"/> Firehouse 51 firefighters were called to the apartment building where his father Pat lives. Pat eventually died at Chicago Medical Center of complications from his injuries. Unlike Will, who had reconciled with their father in the ''Med'' episode \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep38|Generation Gap]]\", Jay never did and only found out the truth after sifting through his father's belongings and finding a picture of him during his graduation from the CPD academy.\n\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep27|Defcon 1]]\" (October 8, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep28|A Nuisance Call]]\" (October 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep29|A Power Move]]\" (October 22, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|Joyriding]]\" (November 12, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep35|Shoved in My Face]]\" (January 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day (1)]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\" (November 12, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep55|Arrest in Transit]]\" (November 25, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep57|Let Him Die]]\" (January 6, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#ep363|Daydream Believer]]\" (April 29, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep4|Mistaken]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep5|Malignant]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep26|Free Will]]\" (November 10, 2016)\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThese are the medals fictionally worn by Halstead.<ref name=\"FortyCaliber\"/>\n\n{| style=\"width=100%;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Personal decorations'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|name=Army Achievement Medal ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Achievement Medal#Army|Army Achievement Medal]], w/1 bronze oak leaf cluster (2nd award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Unit awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=oak|name=Presidential Unit Citation ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]], w/2 bronze oak leaf clusters (3rd award)\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=3|type=oak|name=Valorous Unit Award ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Valorous Unit Award]], w/3 bronze oak leaf clusters (4th award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service Awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|name=Army Good Conduct ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Army Good Conduct Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Campaign and service medals'''\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[National Defense Service Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Afghanistan Campaign ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Afghanistan Campaign Medal]], w/1 bronze service star (2nd award)\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Service ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service and training awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Army Service Ribbon]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Overseas Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Overseas Service Ribbon]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Other accoutrements'''\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Combat Infantry Badge.svg|100px]]\n|[[Combat Infantryman Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:US Army Airborne basic parachutist badge.gif|100px]]\n|[[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:ArmyQualExpert.JPG|100px]]\n|[[Marksmanship Badge (United States)|Army Expert Marksmanship Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:75th Ranger Regiment CSIB.svg|100px]]\n|[[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] [[Combat Service Identification Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Ranger Tab.svg|100px]]\n|[[Ranger tab]]\n|}\n|}\n\n===Adam Ruzek===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Adam Ruzek\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

Ruzek is a police officer in the intelligence unit of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He has also made recurring appearances in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n\nRuzek's parents divorced when he was a child, and he would split time between his father in [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] and mother in [[Canaryville]]. His father, Bob Ruzek ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), better known as \"Disco Bob\", is a longtime patrol officer with the 26th District who had served with both [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight|Voight]] and Olinsky.<ref name=\"DiscoBob\"/> Little is known about Ruzek's background as he rarely talks about his personal life. In season 5, he is blackmailed by Denny Woods into spying on the team in order to save himself and his sister from prison, and his nephew from going to foster care.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Ruzek was still in the academy and about to graduate when he was handpicked by [[#Alvin Olinsky|Detective Alvin Olinsky]] for an undercover assignment. The first season sees him trying to adjust to his new role in the intelligence unit. Although he was warmly welcomed by the team, his impulsive behavior has occasionally landed him into trouble with Voight and Olinsky and irked his more senior colleagues. His naivet\u00e9 becomes apparent during his first stakeout, when he repeatedly looks at his phone and makes bathroom breaks. Olinsky temporarily had him transferred to uniformed patrol duty as a warning.<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/> Over time, he begins to settle in and becomes more mature and less impetuous. In the season 3 episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 3)#ep43|Climbing into Bed]]\", Ruzek has his badge temporarily revoked for going undercover without authorization. Platt reluctantly pulls some strings to lighten his punishment and Voight assures her that Ruzek was worth the risk. He strikes up a friendship with [[#Kevin Atwater|Officer Kevin Atwater]], who transfers to Intelligence from patrol in season 2, and they often banter with one another.\n\nIn season 1, Ruzek was engaged to a woman named Wendy. They are shown to have a close and playful relationship, sending racy photos of each other back and forth. He tries to keep his professional and private lives separate but has difficulty doing so. He tells her that he was assigned to a desk job at district headquarters, which she eventually discovers is not true after he was shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=At Least It's Justice|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D. (TV series)|airdate=April 2, 2014|season=1|number=10}}</ref> That relationship fell apart, partly due his job and partly to his growing infatuation with patrol officer [[#Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess]]. After Wendy calls off their engagement, Ruzek and Burgess pursue a romantic relationship.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=A Beautiful Friendship|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D. (TV series)|airdate=May 21, 2014|season=1|number=15}}</ref> They share a playful relationship, with Ruzek often showing public displays of affection even at work. For example, he agrees to help her take \"revenge\" on Platt.<ref name=\"ThirtyBalloons\">{{Cite episode|title=Thirty Balloons|episodelink=Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep5|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D. (TV series)|airdate=February 5, 2014|season=1|number=5}}</ref> He proposes to her in the season 2 finale and she happily accepts. It gradually becomes apparent to Burgess that Ruzek had commitment issues. She begins to doubt him after learning that he had an ex-fianc\u00e9e before Wendy. At the end of \"[[Chicago P.D. (Season 3)#ep50|Looking Out for Stateville]],\" she calls off the engagement in the same placed he proposed, leaving them both devastated. When Burgess and her partner [[#Sean Roman|Sean Roman]] appear to be flirting, he becomes jealous and their friendship becomes strained.<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\"/>\n\nIn season 3, it was revealed that Ruzek still loves Kim and wants nothing more than resume his relationship with her.\n\nDuring a shootout with Jacob Sims, Adam is shot in the chest. The injury is not severe as his Kevlar vest deflected most of the shot.\n\nIn middle of season 4, Ruzek returns from an undercover job, hoping his job with intelligence is still open, but when he was gone his spot got taken by a guy named Kenny Rixton. Ruzek then talks to Voight about his old spot in Intelligence and if he can get it back. Voight cannot give Ruzek his old spot so he had to work in Uniform. Ruzek is cleaning his locker when Rixton tells him that he is transferring to a newly formed Narcotics unit. Ruzek then gets his job back in Intelligence, but does not get back together with Kim.\n\nIn the season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he appears to be more aggressive with the public, and when Atwater explains to him about the interactions between police and black men. He shrugged off by explain the problems with [[political correctness]].\n\nIn \"Snitch\", his aggressive behavior takes a toll when he punches a suspect and Upton manages to get him out of the situation; he comes briefly under investigation by Internal Affairs but it is dropped when Upton convinces the mother of the suspect's child to get him to withdraw the complaint.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", Ruzek was recruited by Lieutenant Denny Woods, after Woods finds evidence that he deletes information that his sister was charged in a DUI while his nephew was sitting in the car with her. Woods uses it to blackmail Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", Ruzek uploads video of Halstead, while undercover, in a bar fight. He gives it to Woods during a disclosed meeting.\n\nIn \"Monster\", he gets Voight on video taking money from a crime scene without putting it into evidence. Ruzek intends to give it to Woods but when he meets with Woods, he refuses to give him the video because of loyalty towards Voight. Olinsky persuades Ruzek to go with him to meet a CI, but instead drives him to meet with Voight, who has discovered that Ruzek was the mole.\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", Ruzek tries to explain the situation to Voight but is cut short. While Voight cannot do anything about the threatened charges against Ruzek, he conspires with Ruzek to take down Woods. When Ruzek meets with Woods, Woods shoves him onto the car, accusing him of undermining Wood's credibility, since the money actually was put into evidence by Voight, unknown to Ruzek. When this meeting was over, it was revealed Voight was there watching it go down.\n\nAt the end of \"Confidential\", after apologizing about the way he treated Burgess during his relationship with her, they end up having a one-night stand.\n\nIn \"Homecoming\", Ruzek found out that Olinsky had died from his injuries sustained from the stabbing; he supports Voight's actions by trying to block Antonio from intervening in Voight's beating of the killer. He is also present when Voight beats one of the co-conspirators to force him to give the name of who was in charge.\n\nIn \"New Normal\", with Voight suspended, Antonio was put in charge of the unit, Ruzek begins to butt heads with Dawson. Ruzek was getting in touch with Voight for assistance when the investigation into bad drugs was getting nowhere but dead bodies at every turn. He screams at Antonio for Voight not being there. Later, both Ruzek and Dawson have opposing views on good police work to the point of getting into a violent brawl in a dope lab.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", he starts a relationship with Hailey Upton, while keeping it a secret from others. In \"Sacrifice\", Upton ended the relationship with him citing their own careers.\n\nIn \"Fathers and Sons\", while Ruzek working undercover in an investigation of a drug dealing ring that involves the brutal death of a young drug mule, he finds out that his father, Disco Bob, is also involved. So the next morning he visits his father's house for a meeting of the minds. Bob says he's just \u201cgetting paid\u201d and there's nothing else his son needs to know about, but wants his name kept out of the report. Upon this discovery, Upton demands that he either tells Voight about his father's involvement or she will. Ruzek chooses the first option and tries to convince Voight that his father is clean. Voight appears skeptical, telling his subordinate that they're going to follow the facts, no matter where that takes them. Bob accidentally stumbles into the drug deal, which incites a shootout that gets him wounded and blows everyone's cover. Ruzek visits his dad in the hospital and demands to know why he didn't get out when he was warned to. Bob admits that he took the Scorpion Club job because he's broke, thanks to \u201csome bad investments.\u201d He gets teary-eyed as he apologizes for messing up the case and wanting to try and help his son. Voight confirms that Bob was innocent and says that since he \u201cwas working undercover with us\u201d to cover him.\n\nIn \"Descent\", after Voight and Ruzek capture Jason Rizzo, a drug dealer/rapist responsible for kidnapping Antonio's daughter, they let Antonio beat up the suspect to the point that he was pushed to his death. In \"Brotherhood\", upon learning of Antonio's addiction in \"Descent\", he covers for him at the same time when the OID was investigating about the events that transpired, infuriating Voight to point of almost getting into altercation with him. In \"Reckoning\", during a meeting with Platt, Voight, and Antonio, they learn that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation. When he gets called in by Internal Affairs Detective David Heller, he sticks to his story of what had happened, despite the fact that the detective had already known that Antonio was responsible. He almost gets to altercation with Voight, with Voight citing that he is not Alvin Olinsky. At the end, Trudy walks into the unit, saying IAD is there to arrest Adam, but she will take him down to save him the scene, while everyone is opposed to the outcome. Adam appreciates them wanting to come down but doesn't want them to. Everyone is upset, but Antonio remains mum. Trudy walks Adam out, who touches the door; telling him to do more than keep his head down especially if he ends up in General Population, She tries to keep talking but Adam kisses her, saying he will be all right. Heller arrests him and escorts him into the car. Adam goes through the booking process as Antonio sits in the car, popping a pill. Adam sits in the holding cell as the barred door slams shut.\n\nIn \"Doubt\", Ruzek has been stripped of his police powers and he is awaiting trial. However, in \"Assets\", Ruzek's case was dismissed by a favor pulled by Voight, which grants Ruzek his position in Intelligence once again; this event fortifies his loyalty to the latter.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep51|The Nuclear Option]]\" (September 30, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep79|The Beating Heart]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep83|All Hard Parts]]\" (February 9, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 6)#ep127|Hiding Not Seeking]]\" (March 8, 2018)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 4)#ep79|Tell Me the Truth]]\" (April 3, 2019)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep156|Until the Weather Breaks]]\" (April 24, 2019)\n\n===Kevin Atwater===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Kevin Atwater\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

He was previously a patrol officer at the 21st District.\n\nLittle is known about Atwater's background. His parents are either absent from his life or deceased and his younger siblings Jordan and Vanessa live with him as his \"wards\". His colleague [[Kim Burgess]] is one of his few colleagues whom they have regular contact with and it is implied that she has babysat Vanessa more than once. Like [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]] from ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'', Atwater was raised in a gang-controlled neighborhood and had relatives and friends in prison but avoided a life of crime.<ref name=\"PrisonBall\"/> He is known to the firefighters at 51 for throwing \"great parties\" and was once roped in to help organize a fundraiser at Molly's to help one of Lieutenant Severide's men.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Just Drive the Truck|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|airdate=October 7, 2014|season=3|number=3}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time in patrol Atwater partnered with Burgess, who would later join him in Intelligence, and was usually the designated driver. Both Atwater and Burgess were constant targets of [[Trudy Platt|Desk Sergeant Platt]]'s sarcasm. There was a running gag where Platt would assign them a different squad car if they talked back to her sarcastic remarks and mishaps would take place. In \"Thirty Balloons\", after going above and beyond in a hoarder deal, he and Burgess are given a new patrol car the district was given. They are told to keep it in mint condition since Commander Perry is going to drive it in a parade. However, when dealing with a drug mule, the mirror was wrecked when the drug mule tackled Atwater. He eventually uses an old connection from his neighborhood to fix the mirror, thereby avoiding Platt's wrath.<ref name=\"ThirtyBalloons\"/> Before he was permanently transferred to the Intelligence Unit, he worked undercover with [[#Alvin Olinsky|Alvin Olinsky]].<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/>\n\nAt the end of season one he was promoted to [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight|Hank Voight]]'s Intelligence Unit. He is was partnered with rookie [[#Adam Ruzek|Adam Ruzek]] and they quickly become best friends.

When the suspect later dies in jail, he was accused of killing him. Detective Dawson arrests him in the 21st District and Assistant State's Attorney Peter Stone was forced to file charges against him. During the investigation, it was found that he was killed in jail by another inmate and the charges was dropped. Peter Stone apologizes to him in court room for rushing to judgement.\n\nIn \"Big Friends, Big Enemies\", Burgess spots Atwater's younger brother, Jordan, while out visiting potential shooters and targets. Ever since, he keeps a close eye on him to see if he does not follow the wrong path.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", it is known that his little brother, Jordan, was born on October 18, 2002 when he, Burgess, and his friends were celebrating his 15th birthday and Atwater keeps a close relationship with the people in his community. During the investigation into the murder of a mini-mart owner, Roland, Atwater finds out that his brother was involved when he witnessed the murder and confronts him. He identified a gang banger named Curtis as the murder suspect and saw him throw the murder weapon in the nearby dumpster. Following a foot chase, Atwater eventually tracks down Curtis in an alley at gunpoint. Atwater encourages Curtis to go for his gun, which would give him a reason to shoot him, and Voight even suggests that Curtis could go for a second weapon on his ankle. But Atwater, in the end, does not pull the trigger and takes him in custody. In \"Home\", after his sister was attacked for the events that happened in \"Snitch\", he decides to let them move to Texas to ensure their safety. He still keeps in contact with them and misses them dearly.\n\nIn \"Captive\", in the middle of [[Trudy Platt]]'s birthday karaoke party he receives a phone call in which prompts him to leave Molly's to check up on an anonymous person. Only to find out the person's house had been broken into, and another person holds Atwater at gunpoint and knocks him unconscious in which he ditches his badge. When Platt checks his phone, and gets the address of the tossed hours, which is in the name of Joe Baker \u2014 a known drug dealer who has also missing. He was found chained to the ground in the abandoned church when Hailey finds a video on social media of Joe getting assaulted. When Atwater and Joe connect, it was revealed that seven years ago his son Ronnie Baker attempted to rob a store and murdered a clerk in the process after he gives chase and when he refuses to comply orders to surrender, he points his gun to Atwater, and he manages to shoot and kill him. Later found that Joe's sister Michelle had stayed in touch with him and told him to check on her brother. It was also revealed that the city of Chicago had paid Joe $20,000 in settlement which proves his doubt of Atwater's story. Atwater tearfully insists that he thinks about Joe's son every night before he goes to bed \u2014 but he also thinks about the clerk who Joe's son robbed, too. His captors were from a drug gang, Billy and Reimundo Morales who had accused them both of taking his drugs a few weeks earlier. And when Joe in revenge tries to his captors about his real identity, Atwater not only says he's a drug dealer, but claims he's the one who stole the cocaine to begin with. He ended up getting drilled in the leg by a power drill by Morales. Prior to the kidnapping, a girl named Elisa was brought in for questioning in which she confesses that she had drugged Joe and brought him to Morales. With one of the men shot dead by Antonio, Atwater manages to get himself and Joe to escape and eventually get into a fight with Morales for the gun. Joe comes to the rescue by shooting Morales with the service weapon he took off Atwater, that was knocked away in the fight. As soon as it over, Joe puts the gun to Atwater's head and demands to know the full story of his son's shooting. Atwater trying to convince Joe to put the gun down, because he sees the rest of Intelligence coming into the room, and did not want him to die, too. Joe drops the weapon and gets carried to the hospital. Atwater asks him to drug charges against him only to found out by Voight that Joe's friend Calvin Hill had stolen the drugs and set him up. Kevin tells Joe that his son's last words were about not getting on his knees for anyone, in which the same words that Joe put into his son's head. Atwater ends up consoling him.\n\nIn \"Trigger\", while working under undercover in the mosque to investigate a bombing at an Army's recruitment office, he was mistaken to be one of the combatants and was almost subjected to an enhanced interrogation not before Voight and FBI Agent William Graff stormed and Graff offering to apologize for his actions.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep119|Night in Chicago]]\", Atwater goes undercover and befriends a criminal named Daryl Ingram in order to take down the head of a criminal enterprise. While he and Daryl are in Daryl's car, they are pulled over by CPD Officers Tom Doyle and Jim Harper. During the stop, Doyle is overly aggressive with Atwater and Daryl, going as far saying racial slurs at them and drawing his gun, despite both of them being unarmed. They are arrested by the two officers on suspicion of robbery, but Daryl is shot and killed by Officer Doyle. Atwater is conflicted about what to say to Internal Affairs and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, but it is revealed that Daryl did go for Officer Doyle's gun. Voight tells him to do what he thinks is right, as to remember that he gets paid to be a cop, not to change the world. It is revealed that Atwater told the Civilian Office of Police Accountability that it was a clean shooting, clearing Doyle. Atwater meets with Doyle in a bar with the intent to fight him, doing so. He and Doyle fight, and it ends with Atwater putting his gun against Doyle's head, doing what Doyle did to him at the traffic stop.\n\nSometime between \"Assets\" and \"Familia\" he was promoted to Detective.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" (May 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep37|Tonight's the Night]]\" (January 21, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|Just Drive the Truck]]\" (October 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep58|Ambush Predator]]\" (January 13, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep88|I Will Be Walking]]\" (April 19, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Uncertainty Principle]]\" (March 5, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Drill]]\" (April 23, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep141|This Isn't Charity]]\" (October 17, 2018)\n\n===Kim Burgess===\n{{Main|Kim Burgess}}\n\n===Sean Roman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sean Roman\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

In \"Assignment of the Year\", Roman did not know Asher was a felon, and his immaturity shows in his inexperience.

As the desk sergeant, she is the immediate superior of the district's patrol officers. She was previously a training officer ([[Antonio Dawson]] was one of her trainees during his days walking the beat) and had passed the detective's exam twice but had to take a desk job after being shot. She is known for her sarcasm and deadpan humor. She sometimes comes off as cold and heartless, however, she deeply cares for the officers under her command and is shown to go to great lengths to defend them. This is greatly shown when an officer she assigned to guard duty is murdered execution-style by a criminal, she feels very guilty but is moved when many officers show up at the district to support the grieving family. At the beginning of season 1, she often tries to bully Officer [[Kim Burgess]] into running errands for her. When Burgess finally tells her off, Platt intentionally assigns Burgess and partner [[Kevin Atwater]] to a smelly squad car for the day. Burgess's new partner [[Sean Roman]] once called Platt a \"pain in the ass\".<ref name=\"ChickenDynamiteChainsaw\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep11|Turn the Light Off]]\", it is revealed that Platt comes from a wealthy family. Her family disapproved of her decision to become a police officer. Every now and then, she would bring a \"fianc\u00e9\" to convince her father to continue subsidizing her lifestyle that exceeds her police officer salary. She convinces [[Adam Ruzek]] to play the fianc\u00e9 and Ruzek takes the opportunity to eat at an expensive restaurant. She also has history with Voight and Olinsky; she once told Antonio that Voight is the best cop in the city, they hold a close working friendship, and despite Olinsky being her subordinate he is allowed to call her by her first name.\n\nPlatt meets firefighter Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland at Chief Boden's wedding at Firehouse 51 and strike up a friendship almost immediately. He eventually proposes marriage and Platt is sure her dad will spare no cost for his daughter's wedding. Their wedding plans are thrown off course when her father reveals that he was bankrupt due to bad deals and investments gone wrong, meaning that she would have to rely on her own finances. It is also implied that while Platt is financially independent, she has long relied on her family's money as back-up and now has to scale back her lifestyle due to her meager salary. They eventually marry in an intimate ceremony at Molly's in the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep87|On the Warpath]]\" and had their honeymoon in 'God's Country', the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River|Wisconsin Dells]].<ref name=\"DuffelBag\">{{Cite episode|title=In a Duffel Bag|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

The assailant escapes with her handgun, and neighbors realize she is lying on the ground, they call 911 and she manages to tell them that the guy has her gun and she is a cop. Mouch arrives and he wants to know who did this to her. He cannot recall where she said she was going. They question him if it is possible that she was with another guy. She refers to her father as a \"hardass\" when she escorts the suspect's nephew on a date to meet with him. When Ruzek and Olinsky caught a break with regards to Platt's father, Robert Platt, they break down his door only to find him on the ground dead with multiple gunshot wounds. During the investigation, it was revealed that he was beat up in order to get information on Platt's whereabouts. It was revealed that his much younger girlfriend, Natalie, along with her boyfriend, Leonard, were in on a scam to steal his money. But she wanted Platt dead because she was suspicious of her and had her boyfriend commit the attack only to complicate it even further when she was not killed. When Burgess gives an update on her case, and asks Platt about the car, Trust lies by denying she knew whose car it was. The car belongs to Wade McGregor, who also worked for Platt's father. When [[Erin Lindsay]] arrives at the hospital with the file to find both Platt and her hospital detail officer gone. Lindsay calls Voight and tells him she's gone. Trudy arrives in her dad's office and gets a gun, after she grabs Wade McGregor's name off the [[Rolodex]]. She also smashes a display case and takes a golden shovel out of it. Platt now knows who they are after. Voight says we need to  bring her in quietly, and they need to find both before someone gets killed. Wade McGregor is packed up and ready to go, when he turns around to see Trudy standing with her gun drawn. She picks up her other gun and says \u201cThanks\u201d. She throws handcuffs at him. Platt brings McGregor to a vacant building, where she says she knows about him cutting corners on her dad's buildings and that he was selling cocaine and laundered proceeds to his job sites. He says her dad robbed him blind.  Platt wants to know what her father's last words were, McGregor says he does not remember. She puts a rag in his mouth and duct tapes it shut. The next thing we see is Platt cleaning up in the bathroom, with her gun in her hand. She comes out to Voight telling her they need to talk. Voight yells back that she is not him. She breaks down in his arms and cries out that he killed her dad. At the end of the episode, Platt is back in the hospital resting and her husband, Mouch, is there.\n\nIn \"Fagin\", Hailey Upton asks if she had remember her but she did not remember. But later on, she remembers that on February 9, 2003 Platt answered a call at a diner, where a guy came in and pistol whipped the owner when he was closing up, almost killing him{{emdash}}all for $272.57. Platt remembers she was working in the robbery/homicide department at the time.\n \nIn \"Captive\", it is implied that her birthday is on January 17 when her colleagues threw her a karaoke birthday party.\n\nIn \"Profiles\", while being interviewed on live TV by a news anchor, she was injured by a bombing in a TV studio that was later revealed, meant for the deceased anchor.

Before joining the force, Olinsky served in the [[United States Army]] and was at one time stationed in [[Caserma Ederle|Vicenza]], Italy with the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]. Olinsky mentions in \"Called in Dead\" that he has 8 confirmed kills in the line of duty. He is one of two military veterans in the Intelligence Unit \u2013 the other being [[Jay Halstead]], an Afghanistan veteran \u2013 and the duo sometimes exchange banter about each other's service.\n\nIn season 1, Olinsky becomes estranged from his wife, who made him move into the garage for some time, before husband and wife eventually reconciled and he is allowed to move back into the house.<ref name=\"CalledInDead\"/> When Lexi is falsely accused of possessing marijuana, Olinsky is quick to help his daughter out. Even though she is suspended from school, the two have a father/daughter dance in the garage. When an ill-fated party ends in a gang member's shooting death, Lexi is the only witness. Olinsky tries to prevent Lexi from becoming a witness as it would endanger her life. However, when the shooter refuses to confess, Lexi volunteers. In the season 4 three-show crossover starting with the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 5)#ep107|Deathtrap]]\", Lexi is killed in a fire which the CFD later determined to be arson. In \"Emotional Proximity\", when the suspect is in custody, him along with Voight made up a lie on the police report that was stated that he had confessed to them. In [[Chicago Justice]] premiere \"Fake\", ASA Peter Stone rebutted that statement in court when Voight had to testify. The case was closed resulting in the arsonist being found guilty of first degree murder. Olinsky returns to work in the next episode.<ref name=\"S04E17\"/>\n\nIn \"You Never Know Who's Who\", during the investigation in the murder of a former CIA agent, he worked undercover as a contact from CIA headquarters. He was shot and wounded when one of the suspect recognized that his identity was false. The suspect was later shot and killed by Antonio.\n\nOlinsky has a long history with Voight having been partnered with him in a gang unit years earlier. Olinsky's partner was killed by a man named Browning and Olinsky and Voight \"took him for a boat ride\".\n\nAlthough usually calm and reserved he has been shown to have a temper and is not above using questionable tactics to bring a suspect to justice.\n\nBecause Olinsky's desk is behind Halstead and Atwater, there is a running gag where Voight and the rest of the unit would miss him entering the room. Voight would brief the team and tell them to pass on the information to Olinsky \"when he gets here\", only for Olinsky to roll out on his chair and say \"Here\".\n\nIn \"Breaking Point\", he was taken into custody for questioning by Internal Affairs when his DNA came up on the body of Kevin Bingham, killer of Hank Voight's son Justin. When the detectives asked him about his DNA, he requested a lawyer. Lieutenant Denny Woods tries to get information from him in order to put Voight in jail, by offering him immunity. But he leaves his office, turning down the offer. With possibility that he might get arrested, he has a temptation to either betray Voight's loyalty or taking the deal.\n\nIn \"Payback\", he and Voight got tip on who the witness was following from Voight's favor to the Ivory Tower, a junkie named Ruben who tried to break into Olinsky's car a while back. He gives Voight the witness's address, and Voight telling him to not get involved. Voight asks Olinsky about his retirement papers being filed. Olinsky then claims he's not retiring; he just wants to use the paperwork as a flare to see if Internal Affairs will make a move. Voight then admits he's not going to be able to bend Ruben, because he's a recovering addict who is turning his life around. At the end, from an \"anonymous\" tip made to Narcotics, Ruben gets arrested with drugs that were planted on him by Olinsky. He maintained his innocence in front of his wife while Olinsky, watches from his car across the street thus damaging the witness's credibility. In \"Saved\", he revealed that the witness, Ruben, was later released due to lack of evidence. In \"Allegiance\", he was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Kevin Bingham that was convened on \"Saved\" and was arrested by two Internal Affairs detectives in front of his fellow detectives. At the end, he was stabbed in prison by an inmate. In \"Homecoming\", he was soon discovered by corrections officers and rushed to the hospital but died as a result of his injuries. As the investigation into murder goes forward, it was revealed to be a hit by a drug runner for the Cali Cartel that Olinsky was trying to take down while he was in a DEA task force who arrested his brother. His brother ended up killed in prison, and a corrections officer that confided in him was also in on the hit.\n\n====Crossovers====\nLike many ''Chicago P.D.'' characters, Olinsky has appeared in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''. He was the handler of Leon Cruz, younger brother of CFD firefighter [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]], and was assigned to make sure Leon, who was undercover in a gang, was safe.

As a young girl, her father, the owner of a diner, was attacked and robbed by an unknown shooter. After being threatened by the robber, Hailey spent the night at the desk of Trudy Platt when she was a detective in the Robbery-Homicide division. Platt made her feel safe as her father recovered from the attack and inspired Hailey to become a cop. It is revealed that she was meritoriously promoted to Detective after a year-long undercover assignment. She attended the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn season 5, Upton is partnered with [[#Jay Halstead|Jay Halstead]]. The partnership between the two was initially rocky during the first half of the season as Halstead had been getting over the departure of his ex-girlfriend and former partner [[Erin Lindsay]]. They gradually become good friends and confidants, indicated by the fact that it was to her that Halstead finally opened up about his PTSD.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", when she sees Ruzek assaulting a suspect in public, she manages to pull Ruzek aside and get him in the car. And when he was investigated by Internal Affair by what had happened, Ruzek accuses her of going to Internal Affairs, it was later revealed she manages to convince the suspect's child mother to have him drop the charges.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", she was partnered with Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady, who has problems with her. During the search of Quinton Kane, a drug dealer with a likely connection to the murder of a family, he returns to help with the investigation. But when Upton goes to meet with McGrady, he ends up dead and Voight chastizes Upton for letting McGrady come to the scene alone. She's thrown, explaining that she had told him to wait for her and that she was actually ten minutes ahead of the time they had planned to meet, but Voight blows her off. As a result, the officers including his former partner and the McGrady's widow and family ending up turning their backs on her. During the investigation, Upton calls for a private meeting with Voight and shows him a sign-in sheet with McGrady's signature that proves McGrady was in Chicago PD's lab, where a vial of Quinton Kane's blood was kept but is now missing. Upton believes McGrady framed Kane for murder when he actually killed himself to escape his mounting debt. Voight apologizes and then tells her that if she come forward with the truth, and asks her if she wants to tarnish McGrady's legacy and ruin his family over the \u201cjackass\u201d that was a suspect in the family's murder. So, she agrees to stay quiet about what had actually happened. In \"Confidential\", she and Burgess butts heads about how to handle confidential informants when Burgess's confidential information informs them about a dead body, in which Burgess does not believe but Upton decides to investigate. It turns out that she was right and it leads to an sex trafficking, and the informant comes up dead. Upton goes to her CI and she does not push the informant further citing that the informant has a family. Burgess had a problem with how she handled the situation.\n\nIn \"Ghosts\", when a drug bust goes awry, she recognizes that one of the victims was someone that she knows from her undercover assignment prior to joining Intelligence. She suspects that the man she was undercover busting, Ron Booth, is back in business. He immediately becomes the prime suspect and Upton suggests that she goes back undercover to get into his warehouse. Booth still knows her as an Iowa girl named \"Kelly\". It turned personal when she also suspects that he killed her former partner. It was revealed that while working undercover on the night of New Year's Eve, at a party that Booth hosted, he drunkenly tried to rape her. She got away from him before he could, and her former partner got her to the hospital. He then got obsessive over her when he asks \"Ryan\" (undercover Halstead) that if he slept with her and cuts ties with him. When Voight tells her to stop the investigation, she disobeyed his orders and agrees to meet with him without Halstead knowing. After the meeting, Halstead confronts her for being \"too emotional\" with this case. During the meeting with Booth at a parking lot, he checks Upton to see if she was wearing a wire but instead groping her. Booth's nephew got nervous when Halstead starts to make his move and draws his gun, but gets shot dead by Halstead. With the chaos, Booth runs to the stairwell with Upton giving chase and the two end up fighting to gain control. Upton ends up getting the other hand, and beats Booth, and demands that he admit to the murder of her former partner. He does not, so she contemplates shooting him before Halstead arrives to stop her. At the end of the episode, Halstead goes to Upton's apartment to console her.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", she and Ruzek begin a relationship but keep it secret from the other members in Intelligence. They break up in \"Sacrifice\" due to their careers.\n\nIn \"Informant\", her informant is murdered in front of her and it is implied that Voight's CI Darius Walker murdered him to avoid being identified as a confidential informant after accidentally being spotted by Upton's informant. Upton proceeds to avenge his death after implying Walker was the one responsible for setting up the deaths of gang members and cops in a drug deal while asking questions about said crime.<ref name=\"The Devil You Know\">{{cite episode |title=The Devil You Know|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He was one of fraternal twins; his twin sister was [[stillborn]].<ref name=\"DuffelBag\"/> Father and son have a strained relationship due to Justin frequently getting into trouble. He is first mentioned in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' when Chief Boden's firefighters rescue a boy and his father who were in a near fatal accident caused by Justin's drunk driving. After finding out that the boy was now a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], a furious Lieutenant [[Matthew Casey]], whose truck company had responded to the call, files a complaint and is threatened by Detective Voight into retracting his statement. The incident would lead to a long-running grudge match between the two. Justin had other run-ins with the law and did a short stint in prison. His father and god-sister Erin Lindsay have tried to set him straight to no avail. Eventually his father forces him to enlist in the U.S. Army to learn discipline and avoid gangs and the bad influence of his recently released former cellmate. After Justin's departure, Voight is accosted by Justin's girlfriend Olive Morgan as she had not heard from the latter for some time (she presumably did not know Voight had forced Justin to enlist on the spot). Upon learning that Olive was pregnant with Justin's child, Voight reaches out to her. Olive is coerced into luring Voight out by vengeful criminals and nearly dies. She and the baby survive the attack. Justin briefly returns to Chicago on leave after hearing about the incident and assures his father that he will declare Olive as his dependent and have her move in with him. Voight gives him Camille's ring for whenever Justin intends to \"[make] an honest woman of her\". In season 3 it is revealed that Olive gave birth to a boy named Daniel<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\">{{Cite episode|title=Actual Physical Violence|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He never regained consciousness and is taken off life support with consent from his father.\n* Lexi Olinsky (Alina Jenine Taber) was the daughter of Detective Alvin Olinsky. In \"Now Is Always Temporary\", she is suspended by her school after they find joints in her locker. It is later revealed that she was holding for her boyfriend, and that Olinsky had managed to get the truth out of the boyfriend. In \"A  Material Witness\", she is the sole witness in a gang shooting and testifies against the suspect despite her father's and the Intelligence Unit's advice to not testify to avoid being targeted. She dies in \"Emotional Proximity\" after suffering serious injuries in a warehouse fire that was arson. \n* Barbara \"Bunny\" Fletcher<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/> ([[Markie Post]]) is the biological mother of Detective Erin Lindsay. She is a former drug addict who was negligent of her daughter. Lindsay was eventually rescued by Detective Hank Voight, but not before dabbling in petty crime and being arrested five times. In season 1, Bunny tries to reconnect with her daughter and ask for her forgiveness but Lindsay does not trust her anymore following years of disappointment and false hope. Bunny had another child Teddy Courtney, after her relationship/marriage with Lindsay's biological father ended. In season 3, Lindsay mentions her dumping her fifth husband.\n\n===Police officers and CPD employees===\n* Commander Ronald \"Ron\" Perry ([[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]]) is the Commanding Officer of the 21st District until his retirement in 2014.

He is killed by a group of rogue cops in \"Born into Bad News\".\n* Sergeant Erica Gradishar ([[Robin Weigert]]) is Voight's handler from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]]. She is portrayed to be a pencil-pushing climber keen on using Voight and other uniformed officers to further her own career. She was furious upon finding out that Commander Perry had chosen Voight over Lieutenant Belden from Violent Crimes to be promoted to head the Intelligence Unit. After hitting a brick wall with Voight, she then tries to talk [[Antonio Dawson]] into \"spying\" on Voight but her plan backfires as Dawson had a grudge against her. She had investigated Dawson's former partner Sean Patterson over a minor incident of the wrong paperwork being filed but because of her, what should have been a minor infraction taken care of in-house turned into a full blown investigation resulting in Patterson being fired and his pension withheld; Patterson committed suicide a year later.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Price We Pay|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

The two of them form a friendship and Lindsay becomes a surrogate older sister to her, likely because of Lindsay's own similar experience. Nadia begins working as an administrative assistant at CPD to gain experience as preparation to enter the police academy. Sergeant Platt also took her under her wing and would give her tips on how to pass her interviews and study for the written exam. In \"The Number of Rats\", Nadia was kidnapped from Chicago by a serial killer named Gregory Yates ([[Dallas Roberts]]) and found raped and murdered in New York in \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)|Daydream Believer]]\".  She was posthumously honored alongside the fallen officers of the 21st District, including Detective Julia Willhite and Sheldon Jin.\n* Sergeant Edwin Stillwell ([[Ian Bohen]]) is Voight's new [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] handler after Gradishar leaves her position. It is revealed that he assigned Detective Mia Sumner to Intelligence to spy on Voight, and that he blackmailed Sheldon Jin into spying on the Intelligence Unit, particularly Voight. He is arrested in 'Call It Macaroni' for the murder of Sheldon Jin.  \n* Detective Mia Sumner ([[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]]) is a detective assigned to the Intelligence Unit to replace Jules Willhite.

O'Connor]]) is the new Commanding Officer of the 21st District who took over from Commander Perry after his retirement. His appearances are often met with tension from Voight and the rest of the unit. He is blunt and has no qualms about stepping on Voight's toes, compared to the firm but more diplomatic style of Perry.\n* Greg \"Mouse\" Gerwitz (Samuel Hunt) is the Intelligence Unit's new tech analyst. After Jin was murdered, the team had no one handling the technical aspects and duties were split between Atwater and Ruzek, both of whom detested working behind the desk or with anything technical. He served in the Rangers alongside Halstead and did two tours in Afghanistan, in the [[Korangal Valley]].<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/><ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/> During his interview with Sergeant Platt, he mentioned that in Afghanistan, he and Halstead were in the lead Humvee of a convoy when they were bombed. In season 2, the character exhibits signs of [[PTSD]], such as drifting off during a conversation, neglecting his personal appearance, the inability to look at anyone in the eye during a conversation and nervous twitches (restless fingers and stuttering). It is implied that he and Halstead supported one another during their difficult readjustment to civilian life.<ref name=\"S04E02\"/> While Halstead eventually found his calling with the [[Chicago Police Department]], Mouse bounced around from job to job before Halstead took him on as a [[confidential informant]].

In 'A Shot Heard Around the World', he resigns from the force to avoid being shot by a sniper who is targeting police officers. \n* Chief Lugo ([[Esai Morales]]) is the chief of the Chicago Police Department's Organized Crime Bureau, which the Intelligence Unit is a part of. \n* Detective Kenny Rixton ([[Nick Wechsler (actor)|Nick Wechsler]]) was detailed to Intelligence from the Gang Unit as a temporary replacement for Ruzek, who had left for an unspecified undercover assignment. As his transfer was somewhat sudden and circumstances sketchy, the team regarded him with some suspicion. However they eventually find out that he left the Gang Unit as he had refused to take part in an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|IAD]] investigation into a payback beating he did not participate in but was privy of.

He is introduced in \"Grasping for Salvation\" as a lieutenant in the Organized Crime Bureau, where he is questioned about his involvement in a murder case 17 years earlier that he and Voight worked when new evidence pops up. He later attempts to coerce Voight to stay away from reinvestigating the murder, certain that they got the right man. It is revealed that Woods' CI was the person who actually committed the murder, and that Woods had told his CI to say that a man who Woods had targeted multiple times over the years had done it. He is stripped of his police powers by the Superintendent as a result, and all of his previous cases were investigated to check if they were by the book. He returns in \"Reform\", now as an independent auditor for the CPD. His first case is investigating Halstead following a shooting which led to the death of a little girl. It is revealed that Halstead shot a gang member first, and that the bullet went through the gang member, through a wood door, and then hit the little girl. Despite this, Woods continues to go after Halstead until Voight works out a side deal with Alderman Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]). In \"Fallen\", he blackmails Adam Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down after Ruzek is caught deleting information on a DUI charge his sister received while his nephew was in the car. He receives a video of Halstead in a bar fight while undercover, but he does not bite and asks for more. He is arrested in \"Homecoming\" after he is caught bribing a witness into admitting that she saw Voight with his son's killer the night he died. It is revealed that Voight had set him up with the witness, and then proceeded to turn the recording of him bribing her over to Internal Affairs.  \n* Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan ([[Anne Heche]]) is the second in command of the Chicago Police Department and Brian Kelton's number two. She is introduced in 'Bad Boys' where Voight goes to her to exonerate Olinsky after his death. She resigns in 'Confession', where it is revealed that Kelton blackmailed her into taking the fall for his wrongdoings. In 'Reckoning', she gives Voight the name of a drug dealer associated with Kelton as Intelligence looked to take him down. But, in 'Doubt' she reveals herself to be the murderer of Kelton, and is eventually arrested by Halstead and Upton.\n* Superintendent Brian Kelton ([[John C. McGinley]]) was the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and the new mayor of Chicago. It is revealed in 'The Forgotten', that when Kelton was a commander in 2016, he covered up a serial killer's murders in order to keep his stats intact. He sent a homicide detective in to jam up Intelligence in the search for the serial killer, which led to the death of Voight's CI. Voight then proceeds to give Kelton's mayoral candidate Ray Price evidence that Kelton did cover up the murders. It is revealed later than if Kelton were to win the mayoral race, he would disband the Intelligence Unit. In 'Reckoning', it is revealed he won the mayoral race by a landslide, due to his top opponent being arrested for murder. However, he is killed by Brennan in his house only hours after being voted as the next Mayor of Chicago.\n* Superintendent Jason Crawford ([[Paul Adelstein]]) is the interim Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Brian Kelton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476643/chicago-pd-adds-prison-break-vet-to-fill-void-left-by-jon-seda|title=Chicago P.D.

The software backfires when it identifies the wrong suspect and the suspect is killed in county jail, and Voight and Crawford are forced to cover it up by framing the wrong suspect and handing off the actual killer to the gang that got robbed. He returns in '[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]' when Voight comes to him about an Intelligence case where three highly decorated police officers are behind a number of illegal drug deals, only for the officers to be executed by Darius Walker in order to cover up his involvement in it. Crawford and Voight proceed to cover up the crime scene to make it look like the officers died as heroes as opposed to corrupt cops.\n\n===Criminals and informants===\n* Andres Diaz, aka Pulpo (English: \"The Octopus\") (Arturo del Puerto) is a drug lord and criminal, so nicknamed because he \"had [his] hands everywhere\". He has dual American and Colombian citizenship and was said to work for a cartel in [[Medell\u00edn]]. In the series pilot \"[[Chicago P.D.

He was arrested by patrol officers who witnessed him dealing drugs but Voight bails him out because of his value as an informant. Through Maurice's tip, Voight was able to get a lead on Pulpo in season 1. He also appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' in the episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" and provided Voight with some information about a possible suspect involved in the fire at led to [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Hallie Thomas|Dr. Hallie Thomas]]' death.

Halstead would park his car outside the Rodiger home in plain view every year on Ben's death anniversary to make his point to Lonnie that he had not forgotten about Ben and the other murder victims, prompting Lonnie's father Phil to file a [[restraining order]] against Halstead and Voight to give Halstead a stern warning to back off before things get out of control. Lonnie was found dead in the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep10|At Least It's Justice]]\". Halstead was the prime suspect but was exonerated when Phil confessed to killing his son in a fit of rage upon discovering incriminating photos on Lonnie's computer.\n* Gregory Yates (n\u00e9 Williams) ([[Dallas Roberts]]) was a [[sociopath]]ic serial killer who targeted women. He was said to responsible for several unsolved murders in New York. A notable aspect of his crimes was his usage of sadistic torture methods with the intention of letting his victims die slow and painful deaths. His last victim prior to his arrest by the Chicago PD Intelligence Unit was Nadia Decotis. In season 3 he escapes police custody and goes on a rampage while on his mission for revenge.\n\n===Other===\n* Steve Kot (Chris Agos) is an Assistant State's Attorney who often prosecutes perpetrators arrested by the Intelligence Unit and sometimes gives them advice on legal matters regarding their cases. In season 2 he crosses paths with Intelligence and was the prosecutor of notorious [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mobster]] Oscar Bembenek, getting a successful conviction. His sixteen-year-old daughter Dora was shot execution-style in broad daylight as part of Bembenek's plot to seek revenge on those he held responsible for his imprisonment.<ref name=\"TheWeighStation\"/> The character has also crossed over to ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n* Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]) is an alderman who collaborated with Voight on occasion. He is introduced in \"Reform\", where he proceeds to go after Halstead after the accidental shooting of a little girl. He and Voight come to terms on a deal later, where Price will lay off of Halstead while Voight will release a gang member who was thought to be a lookout, who is actually revealed to be the mastermind of the gang. He returns in \"Fallen\", where he and Voight conspire to keep quiet about how the murder of CPD Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady by drug dealer and suspected murderer Quinton Kane is actually a suicide to free McGrady of his mounting debt. In \"Politics\", he asks that Voight to get him crime scene pictures of a Congressman who was a person of interest in the murder of a prostitute who was later cleared. Voight initially refuses, citing the Congressman's support of the CPD and his stellar reputation, but Price responds by threatening to reveal the true cause of Sgt. McGrady's death. Voight then proceeds to give him the photos. He returns in \"Night in Chicago\", talking to Kevin Atwater about what Atwater the night an unarmed African-American was shot by Chicago police officers during a traffic stop. He enters the Chicago mayoral race in \"Good Men\", and is the top opponent against Brian Kelton. He tries to convince Voight to get into politics, and Voight is initially hesitant. Following the death of Voight's CI, caused by the coverup of Superintendent Kelton, Voight gives Price evidence that incriminates Kelton in the cover-up of the murders of a serial killer. In \"Pain Killer\", Price is shot by a sniper and thought to be an assassination attempt initially. It is later revealed that the Voight was the intended target of the sniper. In \"This City\", he and Voight work as peacemakers to attempt to end a gang war that has killed innocent people. In \"What Could Have Been\", Price is at the top of the polls in the mayoral race, but is arrested for the murder of Kelton's top political consultant and [[Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess']] boyfriend, taking the fall for his wife, who killed him to cover-up the drug overdose of a college student caused by drugs that were given to her by the Price's daughter.\n\n===Minor characters===\n<!--characters who appear in less than 4 episodes but have a significant storyline, or future recurring role...-->\n* FBI Agent Troy Kivisto (Himself) - Enters the sphere in season 5, portraying the cooperation the FBI Chicago Division has gained working with the Chicago Police Department.  He brings to the set his vast \"real-life\" military and law enforcement background, including his years working undercover in a task force, as a supervisor, as well as participating in numerous Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) cases with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Illinois State Police (ISP).    \n* Detective Julia Willhite ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]) was the partner of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She appeared in both ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' (1 episode) and ''Chicago P.D.''. The character was killed in the premiere of ''Chicago P.D.'' and was the catalyst for Detective Voight's feud with Lieutenant Belden. She was declared [[Dead on arrival|DOA]] after Belden's decision to withhold information backfires and she and Dawson walk into a trap as a result. Her husband Dr. Alec Willhite (Erik Hellman) has also appeared in several episodes of both ''Fire'' and ''P.D.''. The couple have two children.\n* Lieutenant Bruce Belden ([[Kurt Naebig]]) was from the Violent Crimes Unit and Voight's nemesis. In the show's premiere, he withheld information from Voight's team, leading Detectives Willhite and Dawson to walk into a trap and Willhite was killed as a result. Voight blamed Belden for her death. Belden frequently butt heads with Voight over the Pulpo case. It is revealed that Pulpo had played on Belden's over-zealousness to play \"by the book\" and contradict Voight at any given chance. He is murdered during Pulpo's escape from police custody.\n* Charlie Pugliese ([[Billy Wirth]]) is a former associate of [[Erin Lindsay]] who became a person of interest during an investigation. Voight rescued her from Charlie and she has thus far refused to disclose what really happened, even telling Halstead that he would not want to know the full story. Based on the brief but tense conversations between her and Charlie, it is presumed that he may have taken her in when she was living on the streets and forced her to commit crimes in exchange for food and shelter.\n* Teddy Courtney ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) is the half-brother of Erin Lindsay and son of Bunny. He and Lindsay were once close but lost contact after he \"disappeared\" from home (Bunny assumed he ran away). A photo of him was found in the basement of a house fire which [[Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]] and 51 had responded to. Severide saw the victim clutching a box of pictures and handed it to Voight's team. While sifting through the photos, Lindsay discovers one of a young Teddy. In a three-way crossover (see \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\"), Intelligence and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s Detective Benson and her [[Law & Order:Special Victims Unit|SVU]] team investigate a highly sophisticated pedophile ring-cum-child trafficking syndicate that has operated out of Chicago and New York City for many years. Teddy is found in New York City where he is now a male prostitute. His testimony would lead to the shutting down of the ring.\n\n==Crossover characters==\n<!--characters who have made 4 or more appearances-->\n\n===''Chicago Fire''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Fire characters}}\n* Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson ([[Monica Raymund]]) is the younger sister of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She is a firefighter with Truck 81 based out of Firehouse 51, several blocks away from her brother's district. During her pregnancy (with [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Casey]]'s child), she was temporarily assigned to arson. She, Herrmann and Otis jointly own and run Molly's, a small bar frequented by the characters from all four shows of the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]].\n* Christopher Herrmann ([[David Eigenberg]]) is a colleague of Gabby Dawson at 51 and an owner of Molly's. He largely appears in scenes at Molly's, where he serves drinks and chats with patrons.\n* Brian \"Otis\" Zvonecek ([[Yuri Sardarov]]) is a colleague of Gabby Dawson and Herrmann at 51 and an owner of Molly's. Like Dawson and Herrmann, his appearances are mainly confined to scenes at Molly's, when he chats with patrons while serving drinks. In the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep14|The Docks]]\" he helped Intelligence translate some Russian as the team was investigating some Russian mobsters who spoke no English.\n* Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland ([[Christian Stolte]]) is the husband of Sergeant Platt and a fellow firefighter of Gabby, Otis, and Herrmann at 51. In \"What Puts You on That Ledge\", he helps Roman and Burgess with a case of an uncooperative squatter who refuses to return the apartment to its owners.\n* Peter Mills ([[Charlie Barnett (actor)|Charlie Barnett]]) is a former firefighter and paramedic at 51. He was the responding paramedic to several of the Intelligence Unit's calls involving injured victims.\n* Sylvie Brett ([[Kara Kilmer]]) is a paramedic at 51. She has occasionally crossed paths with Intelligence on the job, dated Antonio on and off, and is friends with Lindsay and Burgess. She and Gabby sometimes hang out with them.\n\n===''Chicago Med''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Med characters}}\n* [[List of Chicago Med characters#Dr. Will Halstead|Dr. Will Halstead]] ([[Nick Gehlfuss]]) is the brother of Jay Halstead and an attending at the Gaffney Chicago Medical Center.

For example, he conducts his own surveillance of Lonnie Rodiger, a young pedophile whom he correctly suspected of murdering young boys, including the younger brother of his high school girlfriend Allie. In the [[Chicago P.D. (season 2)#ep22|season 2 crossover]] with ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', when Will was called in for questioning by Sergeant Benson from the NYPD SVU and Voight as Will knew a victim, Halstead storms into Voight's office and tells them that they will get a written statement from Will and nothing more. Likewise, in season 6, he disobeyed Voight's order to stay on desk duty upon hearing that the fire his father died in was an arson and continued to pursue the case by himself.\n\nIn the pilot episode, it is established that Halstead had been partnered with [[Erin Lindsay]] for the past month and they share a close relationship, which has evolved into a more intimate relationship at various times (which they have had to keep secret) but prevented from going any further due to Voight's dislike of \"in-house romances\". She tries to set him up on dates with her friends in the first several episodes of season 1 but soon realizes that she has feelings for him. He was presumably the first person Lindsay had confided her past to, in full detail. The two struck up a romantic relationship after Erin transfers to a federal task force, as they no longer had to worry about [[fraternization]] rules.<ref name=\"WeDon'tWorkTogether\">{{Cite episode|title=We Don't Work Together Anymore|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

When Lindsay spiralled out of control in the weeks following Nadia's death, he tried to help her, even after Voight had given up. She returns in the season 3 premiere after his cover was blown during an undercover operation to nab a drug kingpin. She rescues him in the nick of time and decides to return to Intelligence, where she is again partnered with Halstead. They reconnect and rekindle their relationship. In the episode \"You Never Know Who's Who\", they go public for the first time by openly kissing while hanging out at Molly's.<ref name=\"YouNeverKnow\"/> They generally maintain a professional front when at work; Burgess once told Lindsay that she \"[forgets] sometimes that you and Jay are dating, 'cause you guys make it look so easy'\".<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\">{{Cite episode|title=If We Were Normal|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

At the end of the episode \"Fork in the Road\", he was seen making a call to Lindsay to propose to her but it was seen that she did not answer the call. It is later revealed that she was leaving for New York City after a series of incidents from the episode essentially led to her accepting a job there and escape further scrutiny from the CPD.\n\nIn season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he is partnered with Hailey Upton and their partnership continues to be rocky. He is a subject in an investigation and scrutiny from public when a drug deal went wrong. When a young girl was shot during the ordeal (and eventually died at Chicago Med), later on showed that the bullet came from his gun.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", it became known that he is still having nightmares about his tours in Afghanistan. He went undercover to infiltrate a kidnapping crew composed of military veterans and struck up a friendship with Luis Vega, his \"target\", due to their shared background as former Rangers who had been deployed to Afghanistan. When the target is killed, his flashbacks came up causing him to dangerously come close to shooting Upton. During the episode, he gets into a relationship with Camila Vega, Luis's sister. He continues to pose as Ryan and does not reveal his true identity to her.<ref name=\"S05E07\"/>\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", the relationship between Halstead and his new girlfriend Camila takes a dramatic turn when he unintentionally gets himself in the middle of a drug operation and a murder of an undercover DEA agent. He later finds out that Camila is a person of interest. But later in the investigation, she confesses that she was recruiting people to become drug dealers. When Voight sees that Halstead was acting strange, he asks him if he was in a relationship with her, he lied and denied it. But when the sting in getting the murderer to confess falls apart, his colleagues rushes in the garage and as she was getting arrested, she realizes that he was a cop. As she was sitting in a jail cell, Upton convinces Camila to not see Halstead again and to not speak of their relationship to anyone or face spending years in prison. In the following episode \"Confidential\", he was placed on desk duty by Voight and was ordered to see a psychiatrist. He eventually returned to the field and admitted to Upton in the episode \"Chasing Monsters\" that he found therapy helpful and was finally addressing his PTSD.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his new partnership with Upton in season 5, the duo have since become close friends and confidants, often supporting one another after difficult cases.\n\nIn \"Endings\", after his father was declared brain dead, he investigated who the person responsible for the fire. During the investigation, it became known that Daniel Mendoza, a drug cartel member, was the one responsible. When attempting to take his brother Juan Mendoza, into custody, he almost gets into an altercation with him only for Upton and Ruzek to stop him. Voight benches Halstead due to his personal connection to the case. Jay is so enraged by this that he insults Upton's dad, saying she's projecting her own father issues. Upton, being tired of him using her as a punching bag, demanded to hand the keys to her. He calls Severide to give him a radio and a ride. He then takes a radio from a uniformed officer and chases after Daniel on foot, he was shot and wounded by Mendoza who was attempting to evade police. He, in return, shot and killed him. Voight berates him for going against his orders and that their conversation is not over.\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Trigger\", he was visibly affected by the fact that a fellow veteran would frame a local [[imam]] and kill innocent people in a deluded quest to prove that the imam was financially supporting terrorist activity; for the first time on the show, Halstead spoke at length about his time in the military and commented that he had learned to live with his PTSD and move on with life, unlike the perpetrator.<ref name=\"Trigger\"/>\n\nIn \"Outrage\", while working undercover in a drug bust, it went sideways when the team identified the suspect as Matthew Garrett, a perp who Halstead thought was in prison. Jay tried to bail before any trouble started, but Garrett had also recognize him and publicly called him out, leading to a brief confrontation. As he left the club, Jay described the guy as \u201cthe devil.\u201d A paperwork SNAFU led to Garrett getting a huge payoff for wrongful arrest, and now he was using it to fund his drug operation. Halstead particularly hated him because Garrett killed a 17-year-old girl. With Halstead benched by Voight over an official complaint against him, they went ahead of the drug bust. Instead of Garrett, his two henchmen were there. Upon finding out the location, Halstead was the first person through the warehouse door and found Garrett shot in the neck. He died shortly thereafter, leaving Jay without the location of the murdered girl's body. When investigated by Internal Affairs, Voight instructed Halstead to lie and say Garrett died before he got there, instead of in front of him. Kelton along with everyone, was convinced that Halstead was the prime suspect in his murder. Voight goes to his old friend, former Detective Gus for answers, while there, he confesses to murder and tells to look the other way. When he couldn't, he gives him \"some time alone\" in which he committed suicide and Halstead was off the hook.\n\n====Crossovers====\nHalstead first appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a recurring character before becoming a main character on ''[[Chicago PD (TV series)|Chicago PD]]''. Within the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]], the character has crossed-over to ''Fire'' and ''Med'' as part of the CPD investigation. He also appeared on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' to assist with cross-jurisdiction cases.\n\nThe character was introduced in season 2 as a regular customer at Molly's, a bar jointly run by paramedic [[Gabriela Dawson]] and her firefighter colleagues. He had fallen for Gabby but she breaks up with him upon finding out he was a \"henchman\" of Arthur, a local thug who had threatened to burn down Molly's. Although her brother [[Antonio Dawson|Antonio]] tells her that Halstead was actually a cop, Gabby decides to end their relationship, as she had felt betrayed even though she understood that Halstead could not blow his cover. They part on friendly terms after Halstead successfully arrests Arthur and taking a bullet to his shoulder in the process. As a result, he opts out of undercover work and joins Antonio in the Intelligence Unit.<ref name=\"Joyriding\">{{cite episode |title=Joyriding|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|network=[[NBC]]|airdate=November 12, 2013|season=2|number=6}}</ref>\n\nHalstead also appeared in later in the season as the lead detective of a murder case involving Gabby's colleague at Firehouse 51. One of [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]]'s men Jeff Clarke was a suspect when the ex-lover of his wife was found dead. The ex-lover turned out to be a loanshark who repeatedly harassed the Clarkes to the point where Clarke has verbally threatened him and had gone to his house with a sniper rifle intending to kill him. Clarke, an [[Iraq]] veteran, later admitted that he tried to protect his wife because she had been there for him when he came home from his deployment, to which Halstead replied that he understood and could sympathize.\n\nHalstead was a central character in the 2018 crossovers with ''Chicago Fire'' and ''Chicago Med''.<ref name=\"Endings\"/> Firehouse 51 firefighters were called to the apartment building where his father Pat lives. Pat eventually died at Chicago Medical Center of complications from his injuries. Unlike Will, who had reconciled with their father in the ''Med'' episode \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep38|Generation Gap]]\", Jay never did and only found out the truth after sifting through his father's belongings and finding a picture of him during his graduation from the CPD academy.\n\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep27|Defcon 1]]\" (October 8, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep28|A Nuisance Call]]\" (October 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep29|A Power Move]]\" (October 22, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|Joyriding]]\" (November 12, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep35|Shoved in My Face]]\" (January 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day (1)]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\" (November 12, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep55|Arrest in Transit]]\" (November 25, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep57|Let Him Die]]\" (January 6, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#ep363|Daydream Believer]]\" (April 29, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep4|Mistaken]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep5|Malignant]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep26|Free Will]]\" (November 10, 2016)\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThese are the medals fictionally worn by Halstead.<ref name=\"FortyCaliber\"/>\n\n{| style=\"width=100%;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Personal decorations'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|name=Army Achievement Medal ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Achievement Medal#Army|Army Achievement Medal]], w/1 bronze oak leaf cluster (2nd award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Unit awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=oak|name=Presidential Unit Citation ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]], w/2 bronze oak leaf clusters (3rd award)\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=3|type=oak|name=Valorous Unit Award ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Valorous Unit Award]], w/3 bronze oak leaf clusters (4th award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service Awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|name=Army Good Conduct ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Army Good Conduct Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Campaign and service medals'''\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[National Defense Service Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Afghanistan Campaign ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Afghanistan Campaign Medal]], w/1 bronze service star (2nd award)\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Service ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service and training awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Army Service Ribbon]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Overseas Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Overseas Service Ribbon]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Other accoutrements'''\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Combat Infantry Badge.svg|100px]]\n|[[Combat Infantryman Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:US Army Airborne basic parachutist badge.gif|100px]]\n|[[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:ArmyQualExpert.JPG|100px]]\n|[[Marksmanship Badge (United States)|Army Expert Marksmanship Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:75th Ranger Regiment CSIB.svg|100px]]\n|[[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] [[Combat Service Identification Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Ranger Tab.svg|100px]]\n|[[Ranger tab]]\n|}\n|}\n\n===Adam Ruzek===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Adam Ruzek\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

Ruzek is a police officer in the intelligence unit of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He has also made recurring appearances in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n\nRuzek's parents divorced when he was a child, and he would split time between his father in [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] and mother in [[Canaryville]]. His father, Bob Ruzek ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), better known as \"Disco Bob\", is a longtime patrol officer with the 26th District who had served with both [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight|Voight]] and Olinsky.<ref name=\"DiscoBob\"/> Little is known about Ruzek's background as he rarely talks about his personal life. In season 5, he is blackmailed by Denny Woods into spying on the team in order to save himself and his sister from prison, and his nephew from going to foster care.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Ruzek was still in the academy and about to graduate when he was handpicked by [[#Alvin Olinsky|Detective Alvin Olinsky]] for an undercover assignment. The first season sees him trying to adjust to his new role in the intelligence unit. Although he was warmly welcomed by the team, his impulsive behavior has occasionally landed him into trouble with Voight and Olinsky and irked his more senior colleagues. His naivet\u00e9 becomes apparent during his first stakeout, when he repeatedly looks at his phone and makes bathroom breaks. Olinsky temporarily had him transferred to uniformed patrol duty as a warning.<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/> Over time, he begins to settle in and becomes more mature and less impetuous. In the season 3 episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 3)#ep43|Climbing into Bed]]\", Ruzek has his badge temporarily revoked for going undercover without authorization. Platt reluctantly pulls some strings to lighten his punishment and Voight assures her that Ruzek was worth the risk. He strikes up a friendship with [[#Kevin Atwater|Officer Kevin Atwater]], who transfers to Intelligence from patrol in season 2, and they often banter with one another.\n\nIn season 1, Ruzek was engaged to a woman named Wendy. They are shown to have a close and playful relationship, sending racy photos of each other back and forth. He tries to keep his professional and private lives separate but has difficulty doing so. He tells her that he was assigned to a desk job at district headquarters, which she eventually discovers is not true after he was shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=At Least It's Justice|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D. (TV series)|airdate=April 2, 2014|season=1|number=10}}</ref> That relationship fell apart, partly due his job and partly to his growing infatuation with patrol officer [[#Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess]].

It gradually becomes apparent to Burgess that Ruzek had commitment issues. She begins to doubt him after learning that he had an ex-fianc\u00e9e before Wendy. At the end of \"[[Chicago P.D. (Season 3)#ep50|Looking Out for Stateville]],\" she calls off the engagement in the same placed he proposed, leaving them both devastated. When Burgess and her partner [[#Sean Roman|Sean Roman]] appear to be flirting, he becomes jealous and their friendship becomes strained.<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\"/>\n\nIn season 3, it was revealed that Ruzek still loves Kim and wants nothing more than resume his relationship with her.\n\nDuring a shootout with Jacob Sims, Adam is shot in the chest. The injury is not severe as his Kevlar vest deflected most of the shot.\n\nIn middle of season 4, Ruzek returns from an undercover job, hoping his job with intelligence is still open, but when he was gone his spot got taken by a guy named Kenny Rixton. Ruzek then talks to Voight about his old spot in Intelligence and if he can get it back. Voight cannot give Ruzek his old spot so he had to work in Uniform. Ruzek is cleaning his locker when Rixton tells him that he is transferring to a newly formed Narcotics unit. Ruzek then gets his job back in Intelligence, but does not get back together with Kim.\n\nIn the season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he appears to be more aggressive with the public, and when Atwater explains to him about the interactions between police and black men. He shrugged off by explain the problems with [[political correctness]].\n\nIn \"Snitch\", his aggressive behavior takes a toll when he punches a suspect and Upton manages to get him out of the situation; he comes briefly under investigation by Internal Affairs but it is dropped when Upton convinces the mother of the suspect's child to get him to withdraw the complaint.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", Ruzek was recruited by Lieutenant Denny Woods, after Woods finds evidence that he deletes information that his sister was charged in a DUI while his nephew was sitting in the car with her. Woods uses it to blackmail Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", Ruzek uploads video of Halstead, while undercover, in a bar fight. He gives it to Woods during a disclosed meeting.\n\nIn \"Monster\", he gets Voight on video taking money from a crime scene without putting it into evidence. Ruzek intends to give it to Woods but when he meets with Woods, he refuses to give him the video because of loyalty towards Voight. Olinsky persuades Ruzek to go with him to meet a CI, but instead drives him to meet with Voight, who has discovered that Ruzek was the mole.\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", Ruzek tries to explain the situation to Voight but is cut short. While Voight cannot do anything about the threatened charges against Ruzek, he conspires with Ruzek to take down Woods. When Ruzek meets with Woods, Woods shoves him onto the car, accusing him of undermining Wood's credibility, since the money actually was put into evidence by Voight, unknown to Ruzek. When this meeting was over, it was revealed Voight was there watching it go down.\n\nAt the end of \"Confidential\", after apologizing about the way he treated Burgess during his relationship with her, they end up having a one-night stand.\n\nIn \"Homecoming\", Ruzek found out that Olinsky had died from his injuries sustained from the stabbing; he supports Voight's actions by trying to block Antonio from intervening in Voight's beating of the killer. He is also present when Voight beats one of the co-conspirators to force him to give the name of who was in charge.\n\nIn \"New Normal\", with Voight suspended, Antonio was put in charge of the unit, Ruzek begins to butt heads with Dawson. Ruzek was getting in touch with Voight for assistance when the investigation into bad drugs was getting nowhere but dead bodies at every turn. He screams at Antonio for Voight not being there. Later, both Ruzek and Dawson have opposing views on good police work to the point of getting into a violent brawl in a dope lab.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", he starts a relationship with Hailey Upton, while keeping it a secret from others. In \"Sacrifice\", Upton ended the relationship with him citing their own careers.\n\nIn \"Fathers and Sons\", while Ruzek working undercover in an investigation of a drug dealing ring that involves the brutal death of a young drug mule, he finds out that his father, Disco Bob, is also involved. So the next morning he visits his father's house for a meeting of the minds. Bob says he's just \u201cgetting paid\u201d and there's nothing else his son needs to know about, but wants his name kept out of the report. Upon this discovery, Upton demands that he either tells Voight about his father's involvement or she will. Ruzek chooses the first option and tries to convince Voight that his father is clean. Voight appears skeptical, telling his subordinate that they're going to follow the facts, no matter where that takes them. Bob accidentally stumbles into the drug deal, which incites a shootout that gets him wounded and blows everyone's cover. Ruzek visits his dad in the hospital and demands to know why he didn't get out when he was warned to. Bob admits that he took the Scorpion Club job because he's broke, thanks to \u201csome bad investments.\u201d He gets teary-eyed as he apologizes for messing up the case and wanting to try and help his son. Voight confirms that Bob was innocent and says that since he \u201cwas working undercover with us\u201d to cover him.\n\nIn \"Descent\", after Voight and Ruzek capture Jason Rizzo, a drug dealer/rapist responsible for kidnapping Antonio's daughter, they let Antonio beat up the suspect to the point that he was pushed to his death. In \"Brotherhood\", upon learning of Antonio's addiction in \"Descent\", he covers for him at the same time when the OID was investigating about the events that transpired, infuriating Voight to point of almost getting into altercation with him. In \"Reckoning\", during a meeting with Platt, Voight, and Antonio, they learn that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation. When he gets called in by Internal Affairs Detective David Heller, he sticks to his story of what had happened, despite the fact that the detective had already known that Antonio was responsible. He almost gets to altercation with Voight, with Voight citing that he is not Alvin Olinsky. At the end, Trudy walks into the unit, saying IAD is there to arrest Adam, but she will take him down to save him the scene, while everyone is opposed to the outcome. Adam appreciates them wanting to come down but doesn't want them to. Everyone is upset, but Antonio remains mum. Trudy walks Adam out, who touches the door; telling him to do more than keep his head down especially if he ends up in General Population, She tries to keep talking but Adam kisses her, saying he will be all right. Heller arrests him and escorts him into the car. Adam goes through the booking process as Antonio sits in the car, popping a pill. Adam sits in the holding cell as the barred door slams shut.\n\nIn \"Doubt\", Ruzek has been stripped of his police powers and he is awaiting trial. However, in \"Assets\", Ruzek's case was dismissed by a favor pulled by Voight, which grants Ruzek his position in Intelligence once again; this event fortifies his loyalty to the latter.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep51|The Nuclear Option]]\" (September 30, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep79|The Beating Heart]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep83|All Hard Parts]]\" (February 9, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 6)#ep127|Hiding Not Seeking]]\" (March 8, 2018)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 4)#ep79|Tell Me the Truth]]\" (April 3, 2019)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep156|Until the Weather Breaks]]\" (April 24, 2019)\n\n===Kevin Atwater===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Kevin Atwater\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

He was previously a patrol officer at the 21st District.\n\nLittle is known about Atwater's background. His parents are either absent from his life or deceased and his younger siblings Jordan and Vanessa live with him as his \"wards\". His colleague [[Kim Burgess]] is one of his few colleagues whom they have regular contact with and it is implied that she has babysat Vanessa more than once. Like [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]] from ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'', Atwater was raised in a gang-controlled neighborhood and had relatives and friends in prison but avoided a life of crime.<ref name=\"PrisonBall\"/> He is known to the firefighters at 51 for throwing \"great parties\" and was once roped in to help organize a fundraiser at Molly's to help one of Lieutenant Severide's men.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Just Drive the Truck|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|airdate=October 7, 2014|season=3|number=3}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time in patrol Atwater partnered with Burgess, who would later join him in Intelligence, and was usually the designated driver. Both Atwater and Burgess were constant targets of [[Trudy Platt|Desk Sergeant Platt]]'s sarcasm. There was a running gag where Platt would assign them a different squad car if they talked back to her sarcastic remarks and mishaps would take place. In \"Thirty Balloons\", after going above and beyond in a hoarder deal, he and Burgess are given a new patrol car the district was given. They are told to keep it in mint condition since Commander Perry is going to drive it in a parade. However, when dealing with a drug mule, the mirror was wrecked when the drug mule tackled Atwater. He eventually uses an old connection from his neighborhood to fix the mirror, thereby avoiding Platt's wrath.<ref name=\"ThirtyBalloons\"/> Before he was permanently transferred to the Intelligence Unit, he worked undercover with [[#Alvin Olinsky|Alvin Olinsky]].<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/>\n\nAt the end of season one he was promoted to [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight|Hank Voight]]'s Intelligence Unit. He is was partnered with rookie [[#Adam Ruzek|Adam Ruzek]] and they quickly become best friends. When Ruzek was engaged to Burgess, he asked Atwater to be his [[best man]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Life is Fluid|episodelink=Chicago P.D. (season 3)#ep39|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago P.D.

When the suspect later dies in jail, he was accused of killing him. Detective Dawson arrests him in the 21st District and Assistant State's Attorney Peter Stone was forced to file charges against him. During the investigation, it was found that he was killed in jail by another inmate and the charges was dropped. Peter Stone apologizes to him in court room for rushing to judgement.\n\nIn \"Big Friends, Big Enemies\", Burgess spots Atwater's younger brother, Jordan, while out visiting potential shooters and targets. Ever since, he keeps a close eye on him to see if he does not follow the wrong path.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", it is known that his little brother, Jordan, was born on October 18, 2002 when he, Burgess, and his friends were celebrating his 15th birthday and Atwater keeps a close relationship with the people in his community. During the investigation into the murder of a mini-mart owner, Roland, Atwater finds out that his brother was involved when he witnessed the murder and confronts him. He identified a gang banger named Curtis as the murder suspect and saw him throw the murder weapon in the nearby dumpster. Following a foot chase, Atwater eventually tracks down Curtis in an alley at gunpoint. Atwater encourages Curtis to go for his gun, which would give him a reason to shoot him, and Voight even suggests that Curtis could go for a second weapon on his ankle. But Atwater, in the end, does not pull the trigger and takes him in custody. In \"Home\", after his sister was attacked for the events that happened in \"Snitch\", he decides to let them move to Texas to ensure their safety. He still keeps in contact with them and misses them dearly.\n\nIn \"Captive\", in the middle of [[Trudy Platt]]'s birthday karaoke party he receives a phone call in which prompts him to leave Molly's to check up on an anonymous person. Only to find out the person's house had been broken into, and another person holds Atwater at gunpoint and knocks him unconscious in which he ditches his badge. When Platt checks his phone, and gets the address of the tossed hours, which is in the name of Joe Baker \u2014 a known drug dealer who has also missing. He was found chained to the ground in the abandoned church when Hailey finds a video on social media of Joe getting assaulted. When Atwater and Joe connect, it was revealed that seven years ago his son Ronnie Baker attempted to rob a store and murdered a clerk in the process after he gives chase and when he refuses to comply orders to surrender, he points his gun to Atwater, and he manages to shoot and kill him. Later found that Joe's sister Michelle had stayed in touch with him and told him to check on her brother. It was also revealed that the city of Chicago had paid Joe $20,000 in settlement which proves his doubt of Atwater's story. Atwater tearfully insists that he thinks about Joe's son every night before he goes to bed \u2014 but he also thinks about the clerk who Joe's son robbed, too. His captors were from a drug gang, Billy and Reimundo Morales who had accused them both of taking his drugs a few weeks earlier. And when Joe in revenge tries to his captors about his real identity, Atwater not only says he's a drug dealer, but claims he's the one who stole the cocaine to begin with. He ended up getting drilled in the leg by a power drill by Morales. Prior to the kidnapping, a girl named Elisa was brought in for questioning in which she confesses that she had drugged Joe and brought him to Morales. With one of the men shot dead by Antonio, Atwater manages to get himself and Joe to escape and eventually get into a fight with Morales for the gun. Joe comes to the rescue by shooting Morales with the service weapon he took off Atwater, that was knocked away in the fight. As soon as it over, Joe puts the gun to Atwater's head and demands to know the full story of his son's shooting. Atwater trying to convince Joe to put the gun down, because he sees the rest of Intelligence coming into the room, and did not want him to die, too. Joe drops the weapon and gets carried to the hospital. Atwater asks him to drug charges against him only to found out by Voight that Joe's friend Calvin Hill had stolen the drugs and set him up. Kevin tells Joe that his son's last words were about not getting on his knees for anyone, in which the same words that Joe put into his son's head. Atwater ends up consoling him.\n\nIn \"Trigger\", while working under undercover in the mosque to investigate a bombing at an Army's recruitment office, he was mistaken to be one of the combatants and was almost subjected to an enhanced interrogation not before Voight and FBI Agent William Graff stormed and Graff offering to apologize for his actions.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep119|Night in Chicago]]\", Atwater goes undercover and befriends a criminal named Daryl Ingram in order to take down the head of a criminal enterprise. While he and Daryl are in Daryl's car, they are pulled over by CPD Officers Tom Doyle and Jim Harper. During the stop, Doyle is overly aggressive with Atwater and Daryl, going as far saying racial slurs at them and drawing his gun, despite both of them being unarmed. They are arrested by the two officers on suspicion of robbery, but Daryl is shot and killed by Officer Doyle. Atwater is conflicted about what to say to Internal Affairs and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, but it is revealed that Daryl did go for Officer Doyle's gun. Voight tells him to do what he thinks is right, as to remember that he gets paid to be a cop, not to change the world. It is revealed that Atwater told the Civilian Office of Police Accountability that it was a clean shooting, clearing Doyle. Atwater meets with Doyle in a bar with the intent to fight him, doing so. He and Doyle fight, and it ends with Atwater putting his gun against Doyle's head, doing what Doyle did to him at the traffic stop.\n\nSometime between \"Assets\" and \"Familia\" he was promoted to Detective.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" (May 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep37|Tonight's the Night]]\" (January 21, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|Just Drive the Truck]]\" (October 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep58|Ambush Predator]]\" (January 13, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep88|I Will Be Walking]]\" (April 19, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Uncertainty Principle]]\" (March 5, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Drill]]\" (April 23, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep141|This Isn't Charity]]\" (October 17, 2018)\n\n===Kim Burgess===\n{{Main|Kim Burgess}}\n\n===Sean Roman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sean Roman\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

She is known for her sarcasm and deadpan humor. She sometimes comes off as cold and heartless, however, she deeply cares for the officers under her command and is shown to go to great lengths to defend them. This is greatly shown when an officer she assigned to guard duty is murdered execution-style by a criminal, she feels very guilty but is moved when many officers show up at the district to support the grieving family. At the beginning of season 1, she often tries to bully Officer [[Kim Burgess]] into running errands for her.

Wade McGregor is packed up and ready to go, when he turns around to see Trudy standing with her gun drawn. She picks up her other gun and says \u201cThanks\u201d. She throws handcuffs at him. Platt brings McGregor to a vacant building, where she says she knows about him cutting corners on her dad's buildings and that he was selling cocaine and laundered proceeds to his job sites. He says her dad robbed him blind.  Platt wants to know what her father's last words were, McGregor says he does not remember. She puts a rag in his mouth and duct tapes it shut. The next thing we see is Platt cleaning up in the bathroom, with her gun in her hand. She comes out to Voight telling her they need to talk. Voight yells back that she is not him. She breaks down in his arms and cries out that he killed her dad. At the end of the episode, Platt is back in the hospital resting and her husband, Mouch, is there.\n\nIn \"Fagin\", Hailey Upton asks if she had remember her but she did not remember. But later on, she remembers that on February 9, 2003 Platt answered a call at a diner, where a guy came in and pistol whipped the owner when he was closing up, almost killing him{{emdash}}all for $272.57. Platt remembers she was working in the robbery/homicide department at the time.\n \nIn \"Captive\", it is implied that her birthday is on January 17 when her colleagues threw her a karaoke birthday party.\n\nIn \"Profiles\", while being interviewed on live TV by a news anchor, she was injured by a bombing in a TV studio that was later revealed, meant for the deceased anchor. She was later comforted by her husband, Mouch.\n\n====Crossovers====\nPlatt also appears in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a recurring character.

Before joining the force, Olinsky served in the [[United States Army]] and was at one time stationed in [[Caserma Ederle|Vicenza]], Italy with the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]. Olinsky mentions in \"Called in Dead\" that he has 8 confirmed kills in the line of duty. He is one of two military veterans in the Intelligence Unit \u2013 the other being [[Jay Halstead]], an Afghanistan veteran \u2013 and the duo sometimes exchange banter about each other's service.\n\nIn season 1, Olinsky becomes estranged from his wife, who made him move into the garage for some time, before husband and wife eventually reconciled and he is allowed to move back into the house.<ref name=\"CalledInDead\"/> When Lexi is falsely accused of possessing marijuana, Olinsky is quick to help his daughter out. Even though she is suspended from school, the two have a father/daughter dance in the garage. When an ill-fated party ends in a gang member's shooting death, Lexi is the only witness. Olinsky tries to prevent Lexi from becoming a witness as it would endanger her life. However, when the shooter refuses to confess, Lexi volunteers. In the season 4 three-show crossover starting with the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 5)#ep107|Deathtrap]]\", Lexi is killed in a fire which the CFD later determined to be arson. In \"Emotional Proximity\", when the suspect is in custody, him along with Voight made up a lie on the police report that was stated that he had confessed to them. In [[Chicago Justice]] premiere \"Fake\", ASA Peter Stone rebutted that statement in court when Voight had to testify. The case was closed resulting in the arsonist being found guilty of first degree murder. Olinsky returns to work in the next episode.<ref name=\"S04E17\"/>\n\nIn \"You Never Know Who's Who\", during the investigation in the murder of a former CIA agent, he worked undercover as a contact from CIA headquarters. He was shot and wounded when one of the suspect recognized that his identity was false. The suspect was later shot and killed by Antonio.\n\nOlinsky has a long history with Voight having been partnered with him in a gang unit years earlier. Olinsky's partner was killed by a man named Browning and Olinsky and Voight \"took him for a boat ride\".\n\nAlthough usually calm and reserved he has been shown to have a temper and is not above using questionable tactics to bring a suspect to justice.\n\nBecause Olinsky's desk is behind Halstead and Atwater, there is a running gag where Voight and the rest of the unit would miss him entering the room. Voight would brief the team and tell them to pass on the information to Olinsky \"when he gets here\", only for Olinsky to roll out on his chair and say \"Here\".\n\nIn \"Breaking Point\", he was taken into custody for questioning by Internal Affairs when his DNA came up on the body of Kevin Bingham, killer of Hank Voight's son Justin. When the detectives asked him about his DNA, he requested a lawyer. Lieutenant Denny Woods tries to get information from him in order to put Voight in jail, by offering him immunity. But he leaves his office, turning down the offer. With possibility that he might get arrested, he has a temptation to either betray Voight's loyalty or taking the deal.\n\nIn \"Payback\", he and Voight got tip on who the witness was following from Voight's favor to the Ivory Tower, a junkie named Ruben who tried to break into Olinsky's car a while back. He gives Voight the witness's address, and Voight telling him to not get involved. Voight asks Olinsky about his retirement papers being filed. Olinsky then claims he's not retiring; he just wants to use the paperwork as a flare to see if Internal Affairs will make a move. Voight then admits he's not going to be able to bend Ruben, because he's a recovering addict who is turning his life around. At the end, from an \"anonymous\" tip made to Narcotics, Ruben gets arrested with drugs that were planted on him by Olinsky. He maintained his innocence in front of his wife while Olinsky, watches from his car across the street thus damaging the witness's credibility. In \"Saved\", he revealed that the witness, Ruben, was later released due to lack of evidence. In \"Allegiance\", he was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Kevin Bingham that was convened on \"Saved\" and was arrested by two Internal Affairs detectives in front of his fellow detectives. At the end, he was stabbed in prison by an inmate. In \"Homecoming\", he was soon discovered by corrections officers and rushed to the hospital but died as a result of his injuries. As the investigation into murder goes forward, it was revealed to be a hit by a drug runner for the Cali Cartel that Olinsky was trying to take down while he was in a DEA task force who arrested his brother. His brother ended up killed in prison, and a corrections officer that confided in him was also in on the hit.\n\n====Crossovers====\nLike many ''Chicago P.D.'' characters, Olinsky has appeared in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''. He was the handler of Leon Cruz, younger brother of CFD firefighter [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]], and was assigned to make sure Leon, who was undercover in a gang, was safe. He also was a guest at Platt's and Mouch's wedding in \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)|On the Warpath]]\".\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)|You Will Hurt Him]]\" (December 3, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)|On the Warpath]]\" (April 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep23|Extreme Measures]]\" (October 20, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 5)|Deathtrap]]\" (March 1, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Episodes|Fake]]\" (March 1, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 3)#ep45|Naughty or Nice]]\" (December 12, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 3)#ep51|Down By Law]]\" (February 27, 2018)\n\n===Hailey Upton===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Hailey Upton\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

As a young girl, her father, the owner of a diner, was attacked and robbed by an unknown shooter. After being threatened by the robber, Hailey spent the night at the desk of Trudy Platt when she was a detective in the Robbery-Homicide division. Platt made her feel safe as her father recovered from the attack and inspired Hailey to become a cop. It is revealed that she was meritoriously promoted to Detective after a year-long undercover assignment. She attended the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn season 5, Upton is partnered with [[#Jay Halstead|Jay Halstead]]. The partnership between the two was initially rocky during the first half of the season as Halstead had been getting over the departure of his ex-girlfriend and former partner [[Erin Lindsay]]. They gradually become good friends and confidants, indicated by the fact that it was to her that Halstead finally opened up about his PTSD.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", when she sees Ruzek assaulting a suspect in public, she manages to pull Ruzek aside and get him in the car. And when he was investigated by Internal Affair by what had happened, Ruzek accuses her of going to Internal Affairs, it was later revealed she manages to convince the suspect's child mother to have him drop the charges.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", she was partnered with Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady, who has problems with her. During the search of Quinton Kane, a drug dealer with a likely connection to the murder of a family, he returns to help with the investigation. But when Upton goes to meet with McGrady, he ends up dead and Voight chastizes Upton for letting McGrady come to the scene alone. She's thrown, explaining that she had told him to wait for her and that she was actually ten minutes ahead of the time they had planned to meet, but Voight blows her off. As a result, the officers including his former partner and the McGrady's widow and family ending up turning their backs on her. During the investigation, Upton calls for a private meeting with Voight and shows him a sign-in sheet with McGrady's signature that proves McGrady was in Chicago PD's lab, where a vial of Quinton Kane's blood was kept but is now missing. Upton believes McGrady framed Kane for murder when he actually killed himself to escape his mounting debt. Voight apologizes and then tells her that if she come forward with the truth, and asks her if she wants to tarnish McGrady's legacy and ruin his family over the \u201cjackass\u201d that was a suspect in the family's murder. So, she agrees to stay quiet about what had actually happened. In \"Confidential\", she and Burgess butts heads about how to handle confidential informants when Burgess's confidential information informs them about a dead body, in which Burgess does not believe but Upton decides to investigate. It turns out that she was right and it leads to an sex trafficking, and the informant comes up dead. Upton goes to her CI and she does not push the informant further citing that the informant has a family. Burgess had a problem with how she handled the situation.\n\nIn \"Ghosts\", when a drug bust goes awry, she recognizes that one of the victims was someone that she knows from her undercover assignment prior to joining Intelligence. She suspects that the man she was undercover busting, Ron Booth, is back in business. He immediately becomes the prime suspect and Upton suggests that she goes back undercover to get into his warehouse. Booth still knows her as an Iowa girl named \"Kelly\". It turned personal when she also suspects that he killed her former partner. It was revealed that while working undercover on the night of New Year's Eve, at a party that Booth hosted, he drunkenly tried to rape her. She got away from him before he could, and her former partner got her to the hospital. He then got obsessive over her when he asks \"Ryan\" (undercover Halstead) that if he slept with her and cuts ties with him. When Voight tells her to stop the investigation, she disobeyed his orders and agrees to meet with him without Halstead knowing. After the meeting, Halstead confronts her for being \"too emotional\" with this case. During the meeting with Booth at a parking lot, he checks Upton to see if she was wearing a wire but instead groping her. Booth's nephew got nervous when Halstead starts to make his move and draws his gun, but gets shot dead by Halstead. With the chaos, Booth runs to the stairwell with Upton giving chase and the two end up fighting to gain control. Upton ends up getting the other hand, and beats Booth, and demands that he admit to the murder of her former partner. He does not, so she contemplates shooting him before Halstead arrives to stop her. At the end of the episode, Halstead goes to Upton's apartment to console her.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", she and Ruzek begin a relationship but keep it secret from the other members in Intelligence.

He is first mentioned in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' when Chief Boden's firefighters rescue a boy and his father who were in a near fatal accident caused by Justin's drunk driving. After finding out that the boy was now a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], a furious Lieutenant [[Matthew Casey]], whose truck company had responded to the call, files a complaint and is threatened by Detective Voight into retracting his statement. The incident would lead to a long-running grudge match between the two. Justin had other run-ins with the law and did a short stint in prison. His father and god-sister Erin Lindsay have tried to set him straight to no avail. Eventually his father forces him to enlist in the U.S. Army to learn discipline and avoid gangs and the bad influence of his recently released former cellmate. After Justin's departure, Voight is accosted by Justin's girlfriend Olive Morgan as she had not heard from the latter for some time (she presumably did not know Voight had forced Justin to enlist on the spot). Upon learning that Olive was pregnant with Justin's child, Voight reaches out to her. Olive is coerced into luring Voight out by vengeful criminals and nearly dies. She and the baby survive the attack. Justin briefly returns to Chicago on leave after hearing about the incident and assures his father that he will declare Olive as his dependent and have her move in with him. Voight gives him Camille's ring for whenever Justin intends to \"[make] an honest woman of her\".

It is later revealed that she was holding for her boyfriend, and that Olinsky had managed to get the truth out of the boyfriend. In \"A  Material Witness\", she is the sole witness in a gang shooting and testifies against the suspect despite her father's and the Intelligence Unit's advice to not testify to avoid being targeted. She dies in \"Emotional Proximity\" after suffering serious injuries in a warehouse fire that was arson. \n* Barbara \"Bunny\" Fletcher<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/> ([[Markie Post]]) is the biological mother of Detective Erin Lindsay. She is a former drug addict who was negligent of her daughter. Lindsay was eventually rescued by Detective Hank Voight, but not before dabbling in petty crime and being arrested five times.

The two of them form a friendship and Lindsay becomes a surrogate older sister to her, likely because of Lindsay's own similar experience. Nadia begins working as an administrative assistant at CPD to gain experience as preparation to enter the police academy. Sergeant Platt also took her under her wing and would give her tips on how to pass her interviews and study for the written exam. In \"The Number of Rats\", Nadia was kidnapped from Chicago by a serial killer named Gregory Yates ([[Dallas Roberts]]) and found raped and murdered in New York in \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)|Daydream Believer]]\".  She was posthumously honored alongside the fallen officers of the 21st District, including Detective Julia Willhite and Sheldon Jin.\n* Sergeant Edwin Stillwell ([[Ian Bohen]]) is Voight's new [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] handler after Gradishar leaves her position. It is revealed that he assigned Detective Mia Sumner to Intelligence to spy on Voight, and that he blackmailed Sheldon Jin into spying on the Intelligence Unit, particularly Voight. He is arrested in 'Call It Macaroni' for the murder of Sheldon Jin.  \n* Detective Mia Sumner ([[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]]) is a detective assigned to the Intelligence Unit to replace Jules Willhite.

O'Connor]]) is the new Commanding Officer of the 21st District who took over from Commander Perry after his retirement. His appearances are often met with tension from Voight and the rest of the unit. He is blunt and has no qualms about stepping on Voight's toes, compared to the firm but more diplomatic style of Perry.\n* Greg \"Mouse\" Gerwitz (Samuel Hunt) is the Intelligence Unit's new tech analyst. After Jin was murdered, the team had no one handling the technical aspects and duties were split between Atwater and Ruzek, both of whom detested working behind the desk or with anything technical. He served in the Rangers alongside Halstead and did two tours in Afghanistan, in the [[Korangal Valley]].<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/><ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/> During his interview with Sergeant Platt, he mentioned that in Afghanistan, he and Halstead were in the lead Humvee of a convoy when they were bombed.

However they eventually find out that he left the Gang Unit as he had refused to take part in an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|IAD]] investigation into a payback beating he did not participate in but was privy of.

He is introduced in \"Grasping for Salvation\" as a lieutenant in the Organized Crime Bureau, where he is questioned about his involvement in a murder case 17 years earlier that he and Voight worked when new evidence pops up. He later attempts to coerce Voight to stay away from reinvestigating the murder, certain that they got the right man. It is revealed that Woods' CI was the person who actually committed the murder, and that Woods had told his CI to say that a man who Woods had targeted multiple times over the years had done it. He is stripped of his police powers by the Superintendent as a result, and all of his previous cases were investigated to check if they were by the book. He returns in \"Reform\", now as an independent auditor for the CPD. His first case is investigating Halstead following a shooting which led to the death of a little girl. It is revealed that Halstead shot a gang member first, and that the bullet went through the gang member, through a wood door, and then hit the little girl. Despite this, Woods continues to go after Halstead until Voight works out a side deal with Alderman Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]). In \"Fallen\", he blackmails Adam Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down after Ruzek is caught deleting information on a DUI charge his sister received while his nephew was in the car. He receives a video of Halstead in a bar fight while undercover, but he does not bite and asks for more. He is arrested in \"Homecoming\" after he is caught bribing a witness into admitting that she saw Voight with his son's killer the night he died. It is revealed that Voight had set him up with the witness, and then proceeded to turn the recording of him bribing her over to Internal Affairs.  \n* Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan ([[Anne Heche]]) is the second in command of the Chicago Police Department and Brian Kelton's number two. She is introduced in 'Bad Boys' where Voight goes to her to exonerate Olinsky after his death. She resigns in 'Confession', where it is revealed that Kelton blackmailed her into taking the fall for his wrongdoings. In 'Reckoning', she gives Voight the name of a drug dealer associated with Kelton as Intelligence looked to take him down. But, in 'Doubt' she reveals herself to be the murderer of Kelton, and is eventually arrested by Halstead and Upton.\n* Superintendent Brian Kelton ([[John C. McGinley]]) was the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and the new mayor of Chicago. It is revealed in 'The Forgotten', that when Kelton was a commander in 2016, he covered up a serial killer's murders in order to keep his stats intact. He sent a homicide detective in to jam up Intelligence in the search for the serial killer, which led to the death of Voight's CI. Voight then proceeds to give Kelton's mayoral candidate Ray Price evidence that Kelton did cover up the murders. It is revealed later than if Kelton were to win the mayoral race, he would disband the Intelligence Unit. In 'Reckoning', it is revealed he won the mayoral race by a landslide, due to his top opponent being arrested for murder. However, he is killed by Brennan in his house only hours after being voted as the next Mayor of Chicago.\n* Superintendent Jason Crawford ([[Paul Adelstein]]) is the interim Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Brian Kelton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476643/chicago-pd-adds-prison-break-vet-to-fill-void-left-by-jon-seda|title=Chicago P.D.

(season 7)#ep134|False Positive]]', giving Intelligence a beta version of facial recognition software in order to find the killer of 2 kids who were in the crossfire of a drug deal gone wrong. The software backfires when it identifies the wrong suspect and the suspect is killed in county jail, and Voight and Crawford are forced to cover it up by framing the wrong suspect and handing off the actual killer to the gang that got robbed. He returns in '[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]' when Voight comes to him about an Intelligence case where three highly decorated police officers are behind a number of illegal drug deals, only for the officers to be executed by Darius Walker in order to cover up his involvement in it. Crawford and Voight proceed to cover up the crime scene to make it look like the officers died as heroes as opposed to corrupt cops.\n\n===Criminals and informants===\n* Andres Diaz, aka Pulpo (English: \"The Octopus\") (Arturo del Puerto) is a drug lord and criminal, so nicknamed because he \"had [his] hands everywhere\". He has dual American and Colombian citizenship and was said to work for a cartel in [[Medell\u00edn]]. In the series pilot \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep1|Stepping Stone]]\", Pulpo is the main person of interest in Voight and the Intelligence Unit's investigations after they discover two dead drug dealers who were beheaded and had their heads displayed prominently nearby.\n* Maurice Owens (David Aron Damane) is head of a local gang and one of Voight's informants. He was arrested by patrol officers who witnessed him dealing drugs but Voight bails him out because of his value as an informant. Through Maurice's tip, Voight was able to get a lead on Pulpo in season 1. He also appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' in the episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" and provided Voight with some information about a possible suspect involved in the fire at led to [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Hallie Thomas|Dr. Hallie Thomas]]' death. As of season 3, according to Voight, he is in prison.<ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/>\n* Lonnie Rodiger (Matthew Sherbach) was a young pedophile who was suspected of murdering several boys, including Ben Corson, the younger brother of [[#Jay Halstead|Detective Halstead]]'s high school sweetheart, some years ago. Halstead would park his car outside the Rodiger home in plain view every year on Ben's death anniversary to make his point to Lonnie that he had not forgotten about Ben and the other murder victims, prompting Lonnie's father Phil to file a [[restraining order]] against Halstead and Voight to give Halstead a stern warning to back off before things get out of control. Lonnie was found dead in the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep10|At Least It's Justice]]\". Halstead was the prime suspect but was exonerated when Phil confessed to killing his son in a fit of rage upon discovering incriminating photos on Lonnie's computer.\n* Gregory Yates (n\u00e9 Williams) ([[Dallas Roberts]]) was a [[sociopath]]ic serial killer who targeted women. He was said to responsible for several unsolved murders in New York. A notable aspect of his crimes was his usage of sadistic torture methods with the intention of letting his victims die slow and painful deaths. His last victim prior to his arrest by the Chicago PD Intelligence Unit was Nadia Decotis. In season 3 he escapes police custody and goes on a rampage while on his mission for revenge.\n\n===Other===\n* Steve Kot (Chris Agos) is an Assistant State's Attorney who often prosecutes perpetrators arrested by the Intelligence Unit and sometimes gives them advice on legal matters regarding their cases. In season 2 he crosses paths with Intelligence and was the prosecutor of notorious [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mobster]] Oscar Bembenek, getting a successful conviction. His sixteen-year-old daughter Dora was shot execution-style in broad daylight as part of Bembenek's plot to seek revenge on those he held responsible for his imprisonment.<ref name=\"TheWeighStation\"/> The character has also crossed over to ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n* Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]) is an alderman who collaborated with Voight on occasion. He is introduced in \"Reform\", where he proceeds to go after Halstead after the accidental shooting of a little girl. He and Voight come to terms on a deal later, where Price will lay off of Halstead while Voight will release a gang member who was thought to be a lookout, who is actually revealed to be the mastermind of the gang. He returns in \"Fallen\", where he and Voight conspire to keep quiet about how the murder of CPD Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady by drug dealer and suspected murderer Quinton Kane is actually a suicide to free McGrady of his mounting debt. In \"Politics\", he asks that Voight to get him crime scene pictures of a Congressman who was a person of interest in the murder of a prostitute who was later cleared. Voight initially refuses, citing the Congressman's support of the CPD and his stellar reputation, but Price responds by threatening to reveal the true cause of Sgt. McGrady's death. Voight then proceeds to give him the photos. He returns in \"Night in Chicago\", talking to Kevin Atwater about what Atwater the night an unarmed African-American was shot by Chicago police officers during a traffic stop. He enters the Chicago mayoral race in \"Good Men\", and is the top opponent against Brian Kelton. He tries to convince Voight to get into politics, and Voight is initially hesitant. Following the death of Voight's CI, caused by the coverup of Superintendent Kelton, Voight gives Price evidence that incriminates Kelton in the cover-up of the murders of a serial killer. In \"Pain Killer\", Price is shot by a sniper and thought to be an assassination attempt initially. It is later revealed that the Voight was the intended target of the sniper. In \"This City\", he and Voight work as peacemakers to attempt to end a gang war that has killed innocent people. In \"What Could Have Been\", Price is at the top of the polls in the mayoral race, but is arrested for the murder of Kelton's top political consultant and [[Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess']] boyfriend, taking the fall for his wife, who killed him to cover-up the drug overdose of a college student caused by drugs that were given to her by the Price's daughter.\n\n===Minor characters===\n<!--characters who appear in less than 4 episodes but have a significant storyline, or future recurring role...-->\n* FBI Agent Troy Kivisto (Himself) - Enters the sphere in season 5, portraying the cooperation the FBI Chicago Division has gained working with the Chicago Police Department.  He brings to the set his vast \"real-life\" military and law enforcement background, including his years working undercover in a task force, as a supervisor, as well as participating in numerous Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) cases with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Illinois State Police (ISP).    \n* Detective Julia Willhite ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]) was the partner of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She appeared in both ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' (1 episode) and ''Chicago P.D.''. The character was killed in the premiere of ''Chicago P.D.'' and was the catalyst for Detective Voight's feud with Lieutenant Belden. She was declared [[Dead on arrival|DOA]] after Belden's decision to withhold information backfires and she and Dawson walk into a trap as a result. Her husband Dr. Alec Willhite (Erik Hellman) has also appeared in several episodes of both ''Fire'' and ''P.D.''. The couple have two children.\n* Lieutenant Bruce Belden ([[Kurt Naebig]]) was from the Violent Crimes Unit and Voight's nemesis. In the show's premiere, he withheld information from Voight's team, leading Detectives Willhite and Dawson to walk into a trap and Willhite was killed as a result. Voight blamed Belden for her death. Belden frequently butt heads with Voight over the Pulpo case. It is revealed that Pulpo had played on Belden's over-zealousness to play \"by the book\" and contradict Voight at any given chance. He is murdered during Pulpo's escape from police custody.\n* Charlie Pugliese ([[Billy Wirth]]) is a former associate of [[Erin Lindsay]] who became a person of interest during an investigation. Voight rescued her from Charlie and she has thus far refused to disclose what really happened, even telling Halstead that he would not want to know the full story. Based on the brief but tense conversations between her and Charlie, it is presumed that he may have taken her in when she was living on the streets and forced her to commit crimes in exchange for food and shelter.\n* Teddy Courtney ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) is the half-brother of Erin Lindsay and son of Bunny. He and Lindsay were once close but lost contact after he \"disappeared\" from home (Bunny assumed he ran away). A photo of him was found in the basement of a house fire which [[Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]] and 51 had responded to. Severide saw the victim clutching a box of pictures and handed it to Voight's team. While sifting through the photos, Lindsay discovers one of a young Teddy. In a three-way crossover (see \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\"), Intelligence and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s Detective Benson and her [[Law & Order:Special Victims Unit|SVU]] team investigate a highly sophisticated pedophile ring-cum-child trafficking syndicate that has operated out of Chicago and New York City for many years. Teddy is found in New York City where he is now a male prostitute. His testimony would lead to the shutting down of the ring.\n\n==Crossover characters==\n<!--characters who have made 4 or more appearances-->\n\n===''Chicago Fire''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Fire characters}}\n* Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson ([[Monica Raymund]]) is the younger sister of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She is a firefighter with Truck 81 based out of Firehouse 51, several blocks away from her brother's district. During her pregnancy (with [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Casey]]'s child), she was temporarily assigned to arson. She, Herrmann and Otis jointly own and run Molly's, a small bar frequented by the characters from all four shows of the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]].\n* Christopher Herrmann ([[David Eigenberg]]) is a colleague of Gabby Dawson at 51 and an owner of Molly's. He largely appears in scenes at Molly's, where he serves drinks and chats with patrons.\n* Brian \"Otis\" Zvonecek ([[Yuri Sardarov]]) is a colleague of Gabby Dawson and Herrmann at 51 and an owner of Molly's. Like Dawson and Herrmann, his appearances are mainly confined to scenes at Molly's, when he chats with patrons while serving drinks. In the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep14|The Docks]]\" he helped Intelligence translate some Russian as the team was investigating some Russian mobsters who spoke no English.\n* Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland ([[Christian Stolte]]) is the husband of Sergeant Platt and a fellow firefighter of Gabby, Otis, and Herrmann at 51. In \"What Puts You on That Ledge\", he helps Roman and Burgess with a case of an uncooperative squatter who refuses to return the apartment to its owners.\n* Peter Mills ([[Charlie Barnett (actor)|Charlie Barnett]]) is a former firefighter and paramedic at 51. He was the responding paramedic to several of the Intelligence Unit's calls involving injured victims.\n* Sylvie Brett ([[Kara Kilmer]]) is a paramedic at 51. She has occasionally crossed paths with Intelligence on the job, dated Antonio on and off, and is friends with Lindsay and Burgess. She and Gabby sometimes hang out with them.\n\n===''Chicago Med''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Med characters}}\n* [[List of Chicago Med characters#Dr. Will Halstead|Dr. Will Halstead]] ([[Nick Gehlfuss]]) is the brother of Jay Halstead and an attending at the Gaffney Chicago Medical Center. He was first introduced in the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 2)#ep32|Say Her Real Name]]\" when he returns home to Chicago and was trying to stop a bar fight when the officer called to the incident recognized his last name and called Platt to alert Jay. He initially moves back from New York City after being \"kicked out\" of a practice by his partners and then gets a job at Chicago Med, only to tell Jay that he would be returning to New York City after his first day.<ref>{{cite episode |title=I Am the Apocalypse|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|network=[[NBC]]|airdate=April 7, 2015|season=3|number=19}}</ref> In the ''Chicago P.D.'' episode \"[[Chicago P.D.

It is the most well-known effort at standardizing GGP AI, and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems. The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the [[Game Description Language]]. In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ggpserver/ GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems.</ref><ref>[http://130.208.241.192/ggpserver/ Dresden GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems with automatic scheduling of matches.</ref> that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.\n\nSince 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the [[AAAI]] Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize.<ref name=\":2\"/> So far, the following programs were victorious:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.general-game-playing.de/|title=General Game Playing|website=www.general-game-playing.de}}</ref>\n\n* 2005: Cluneplayer, by Jim Clune ([[UCLA]])\n* 2006: Fluxplayer,<ref>[http://www.general-game-playing.de/research.html Information about Fluxplayer], the winner of the 2nd International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Stephan Schiffel and Michael Thielscher ([[Dresden University of Technology]])\n* 2007: Cadiaplayer,<ref>[http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/public:cadiaplayer:main  Information about CADIAPlayer], more information about the winner of the 3rd, 4th, and 8th International General Game Playing competitions.</ref> by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson and Hilmar Finnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2008: Cadiaplayer, by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson, Hilmar Finnsson and Gylfi \u00de\u00f3r Gu\u00f0mundsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2009: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2010: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2011: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2012: Cadiaplayer, by Hilmar Finnsson and Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2013: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2014: Sancho,<ref>[http://sanchoggp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/sancho-is-ggp-champion-2014.html Sancho is GGP Champion 2014!], winner of the 2014 International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Steve Draper and Andrew Rose\n* 2015: Galvanise, by Richard Emslie\n* 2016: WoodStock, by Eric Piette ([[Artois University]])\n\n=== Other approaches ===\nThere are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules.

In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition. It has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the '''Video Game Description Language (VGDL)''', which should not be confused with [[Game Description Language|GDL]] and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed. One example for VGDL is PyVGDL developed in 2013.<ref name=paperschaul/><ref name=gitschaul/> The games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2-dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify.<ref name=dagstuhl/> To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in VGDL manually. VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/PLG_ASP_GVG.pdf|title=Procedural Level Generation with Answer Set Programming for General Video Game Playing|last=Neufeld|first=Xenija|last2=Mostaghim|first2=Sanaz|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Perez-Liebana|first3=Diego}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nSince GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] techniques are often most effective.\n\nA popular method for developing GGP AI is the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) algorithm.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228393769|title=Monte-Carlo Tree Search for General Game Playing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref> Often used together with the UCT method (''Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees''), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finnsson|first=Hilmar|date=2012|title=Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4935/5300|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Frydenberg2015Investigating.pdf|title=Investigating MCTS Modifications in General Video Game Playing|last=Frydenberg|first=Frederik|last2=Anderson|first2=Kasper R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Risi|first3=Sebastian|last4=Togelius|first4=Julian}}</ref><ref>M.

In the book ''Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds'', Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences.<ref>Jesper Juul. Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. MIT Press, 2005.</ref>  Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.<ref name=dagstuhl>{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial General Intelligence]]\n* [[AlphaZero]]\n* [[Game Description Language]]\n* [[Multi-task learning]]\n* [[Transfer learning]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Domain-specific entertainment language]]\n* [[Artificial intelligence (video games)]]\n* [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|Software tools for experimental economics]], since experimental economics conducts game experiments\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://logic.stanford.edu/ggp/homepage/index.php General Game Playing Home Page at Stanford University]\n:See also the [http://cs227b.stanford.edu/ CS227B - General Game Playing course page], [http://www.ggp.org/ GGP.org], [https://github.com/ggp-org GGP.org GitHub page], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235146/http://games.stanford.edu/ games.stanford.edu]. \n\n* [http://www.general-game-playing.de/ General Game Playing Resources] provided by Dresden University of Technology.\n* [http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/ AiAi by Stephen Tavener]\n* [http://www.polyomino.com/ PolyGamo Player Project by David M.

In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ggpserver/ GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems.</ref><ref>[http://130.208.241.192/ggpserver/ Dresden GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems with automatic scheduling of matches.</ref> that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.\n\nSince 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the [[AAAI]] Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize.<ref name=\":2\"/> So far, the following programs were victorious:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.general-game-playing.de/|title=General Game Playing|website=www.general-game-playing.de}}</ref>\n\n* 2005: Cluneplayer, by Jim Clune ([[UCLA]])\n* 2006: Fluxplayer,<ref>[http://www.general-game-playing.de/research.html Information about Fluxplayer], the winner of the 2nd International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Stephan Schiffel and Michael Thielscher ([[Dresden University of Technology]])\n* 2007: Cadiaplayer,<ref>[http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/public:cadiaplayer:main  Information about CADIAPlayer], more information about the winner of the 3rd, 4th, and 8th International General Game Playing competitions.</ref> by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson and Hilmar Finnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2008: Cadiaplayer, by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson, Hilmar Finnsson and Gylfi \u00de\u00f3r Gu\u00f0mundsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2009: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2010: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2011: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2012: Cadiaplayer, by Hilmar Finnsson and Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2013: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2014: Sancho,<ref>[http://sanchoggp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/sancho-is-ggp-champion-2014.html Sancho is GGP Champion 2014!], winner of the 2014 International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Steve Draper and Andrew Rose\n* 2015: Galvanise, by Richard Emslie\n* 2016: WoodStock, by Eric Piette ([[Artois University]])\n\n=== Other approaches ===\nThere are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules.

B.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Togelius|first3=Julian|last4=Nelson|first4=Mark J.}}</ref>\n\n===Video Game Description Language===\n\nThe '''General Video Game AI Competition''' ([http://gvgai.net/ GVGAI]) has been running since 2014. In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition. It has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the '''Video Game Description Language (VGDL)''', which should not be confused with [[Game Description Language|GDL]] and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed. One example for VGDL is PyVGDL developed in 2013.<ref name=paperschaul/><ref name=gitschaul/> The games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2-dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify.<ref name=dagstuhl/> To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in VGDL manually. VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/PLG_ASP_GVG.pdf|title=Procedural Level Generation with Answer Set Programming for General Video Game Playing|last=Neufeld|first=Xenija|last2=Mostaghim|first2=Sanaz|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Perez-Liebana|first3=Diego}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nSince GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] techniques are often most effective.\n\nA popular method for developing GGP AI is the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) algorithm.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228393769|title=Monte-Carlo Tree Search for General Game Playing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref> Often used together with the UCT method (''Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees''), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finnsson|first=Hilmar|date=2012|title=Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4935/5300|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Frydenberg2015Investigating.pdf|title=Investigating MCTS Modifications in General Video Game Playing|last=Frydenberg|first=Frederik|last2=Anderson|first2=Kasper R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Risi|first3=Sebastian|last4=Togelius|first4=Julian}}</ref><ref>M.

In the book ''Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds'', Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences.<ref>Jesper Juul. Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. MIT Press, 2005.</ref>  Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.<ref name=dagstuhl>{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial General Intelligence]]\n* [[AlphaZero]]\n* [[Game Description Language]]\n* [[Multi-task learning]]\n* [[Transfer learning]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Domain-specific entertainment language]]\n* [[Artificial intelligence (video games)]]\n* [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|Software tools for experimental economics]], since experimental economics conducts game experiments\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://logic.stanford.edu/ggp/homepage/index.php General Game Playing Home Page at Stanford University]\n:See also the [http://cs227b.stanford.edu/ CS227B - General Game Playing course page], [http://www.ggp.org/ GGP.org], [https://github.com/ggp-org GGP.org GitHub page], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235146/http://games.stanford.edu/ games.stanford.edu]. \n\n* [http://www.general-game-playing.de/ General Game Playing Resources] provided by Dresden University of Technology.\n* [http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/ AiAi by Stephen Tavener]\n* [http://www.polyomino.com/ PolyGamo Player Project by David M.

In its extreme form, reactive astrogliosis can lead to the appearance of newly proliferated astrocytes and [[glial scar|scar formation]] in response to severe tissue damage or inflammation.\n\nMolecular triggers that lead to this scar formation include [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF), [[endothelins|endothelin 1]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Mature astrocytes can re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate during scar formation. Some proliferating reactive astrocytes can derive from [[NG2 glia|NG2 progenitor cells]] in the local parenchyma from [[ependymal cell]] progenitors after injury or stroke. There are also multipotent progenitors in subependymal tissue that express [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] ([[Glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]]) and generate progeny cells that migrate towards sites of injury after trauma or stroke.<ref name=eddelston>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(93)90380-X |title=Molecular profile of reactive astrocytes\u2014Implications for their role in neurologic disease |year=1993 |last1=Eddleston |first1=M. |last2=Mucke |first2=L. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=54 |pages=15\u201336 |pmid=8515840 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Regulation of inflammation ===\nReactive astrocytes are related to the normal function of astrocytes.

For example, a few studies have used [[nerve growth factors]] to regain some [[cholinergic]] function in patients with [[Alzheimer's]].<ref name=colangelo />\n\n===Anti-gliosis function of BB14===\nOne specific drug candidate is BB14, which is a nerve growth factor-like peptide that acts as a [[TrkA]] [[agonist]].<ref name=colangelo>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.06.016 |title=Targeting reactive astrogliosis by novel biotechnological strategies |year=2012 |last1=Colangelo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Cirillo |first2=Giovanni |last3=Lavitrano |first3=Maria Luisa |last4=Alberghina |first4=Lilia |last5=Papa |first5=Michele |journal=Biotechnology Advances |volume=30 |pages=261\u201371 |pmid=21763415 |issue=1}}</ref> BB14 was shown to reduce reactive astrogliosis following peripheral nerve injuries in rats by acting on DRG and PC12 cell differentiation.<ref name=colangelo /> Although further research is needed, BB14 has the potential to treat a variety neurological diseases. Further research of neurotrophins could potentially lead to the development of a highly selective, potent, and small neurotrophin that targets reactive gliosis to alleviate some neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n===Regulatory function of TGFB===\n[[TGFB]] is a regulatory molecule involved in [[proteoglycan]] production. This production is increased in the presence of [[bFGF]] or [[Interleukin 1]]. An anti-TGF\u03b2 antibody may potentially reduce [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]] upregulation after CNS injuries, promoting axonal regeneration.<ref name=\"fawcett\" />\n\n===Ethidium bromide treatment===\nInjection of [[ethidium bromide]] kills all CNS [[glia]] ([[oligodendrocytes]] and [[astrocytes]]), but leaves axons, blood vessels, and [[macrophages]] unaffected.<ref name=\"fawcett\" /><ref name=\"mcgraw real\" /> This provides an environment conducive to axonal regeneration for about four days.

Consequently, increased [[metalloproteinase]] in the environment around axons may facilitate axonal regeneration via degradation of inhibitory molecules due to increased proteolytic activity.<ref name=\"fawcett\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Neurology]]\n[[Category:Glial cells]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCauses:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"}

Kord's signature equipment was his bug-shaped personal aircraft, which he entered and exited typically with a cable suspended from the cockpit. He also generally eschewed personal weaponry, except for a pistol that made a blinding flash of light and, additionally, a strong airblast to gain the advantage when he closed in for hand-to-hand combat.\n\n[[Image:BlueBeetle3.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Blue Beetle'' #3 (October 1967).

A sixth issue was produced, but published in the ''Charlton Portfolio'' by [[CPL Gang]]. The [[Question (character)|Question]] ran as a backup series, with the fifth issue featuring a quasi-team-up in which the Blue Beetle story continues in part in the Question tale.\n\nAn origin was given in issue #2, linking Ted Kord to the previous Blue Beetle. Ted was revealed as a former student of Dan Garrett, and when they were investigating Ted's uncle, Jarvis Kord, they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in the battle.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Blue Beetle | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=57 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> As he died, he passed on the responsibility of being Blue Beetle to Ted, but was not able to pass on the mystical scarab, a convenient means for Ditko to explain his preference for a power-free character. There was a hint that one android was still left in stasis, but this would remain unresolved until the DC series of the late 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the first issue of Charlton's anthology comic ''[[Charlton Bullseye (comics)|Charlton Bullseye]]'' featured a team-up of the Blue Beetle and the Question. Later, [[AC Comics]] would publish a story intended for ''Charlton Bullseye'' in ''Americomics'' #3, and a one-shot of a team-up of all the Charlton \"Action Heroes\" called the [[Sentinels of Justice]], as the company called its lineup. Upon losing Blue Beetle, AC Comics created a similar character called [[Scarlet Scorpion]].\n\n===DC Comics===\n====DC solo series====\n[[Image:Bbso.PNG|Cover to ''Secret Origins'' #2. Art by Gil Kane|160px|thumb]]\nDC Comics acquired the Charlton heroes in the mid-1980s and used the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event to integrate them all into the DC Universe. During this period, Blue Beetle had his own series, written by [[Len Wein]],<ref>Manning, Matthew K. \"1980s\" in Dolan, p. 219 \"The Blue Beetle swung into his own DC series with the help of writer Len Wein and artist Paris Cullins.\"</ref> which ran for 24 issues from June 1986 to May [[1988 in comics|1988]]. Also published during this time was ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #2 (cover illustrated by [[Gil Kane]]), which explained the origins and careers of the Ted Kord and Dan Garrett Blue Beetles in the post-Crisis [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. They would also follow up on the hinted android in stasis from the Charlton series, which would eventually become \"[[Carapax]], the Indestructible Man\".\n\nIn his monthly, solo series, Ted Kord was shown as an industrialist, the owner of KORD Industries; Which he took over from his father Thomas Kord and transformed it from a small R & D company to a scientific industry rivaling S.T.A.R. Labs Upon joining the newly formed Justice League (following the events in LEGENDS 1\u20136) Ted was more often portrayed as a second string joke. He was short on money, leading to his entering \"get-rich-quick\" schemes with [[Booster Gold]], A brief appearance in ''JLA: Year One'' showed the young Ted working in Kord Industries R&D, where he designed the JLA HQ security system. Upon meeting the heroes, he thought, \"Screw the family business. I want to be one of those guys,\" possibly explaining the company's fluctuating status since he took over. In recent comics, it has been implied that KORD Industries has become a subsidiary of [[Wayne Enterprises]], headed by Bruce Wayne (also known as [[Batman]]).\n\n====Joining the Justice League====\n{{Main|Justice League International}}\n[[Image:Jli issue8 cover.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''JLI'' #8 (December 1987). Art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] (pencils) and [[Al Gordon]] (inks)]]\nBlue Beetle is probably best known as the wisecracking member of [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' lighthearted, five-year run on various ''Justice League of America'' titles (notably ''Justice League International''), where he was memorably partnered with fellow third-string hero [[Booster Gold]], and the two quickly became best friends. Among fans, they were known collectively as the \"Blue and Gold\" team.{{fact?|date=April 2015}} For a while, Beetle grappled with a weight problem, but with sheer determination and coaching from the hero [[General Glory]], as well as competing against [[Power Girl]], he defeated it. After Giffen and DeMatteis left, ''Justice League America'' continued to run until issue #113. [[Dan Jurgens]] tied \"[[The Death of Superman]]\" storyline into ''JLA'', in which [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] left Blue Beetle in a coma during his murderous rampage, as well as a six-inch scar on the back of his skull. Beetle and Booster both subsequently joined the short-lived Justice League offshoot known as [[Extreme Justice]].<ref name=\"dc-extr\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | contribution=Extreme Justice | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=117 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>\n\nBlue Beetle then entered a period of relative obscurity. The [[miniseries]] ''The LAW (Living Assault Weapons)'' reunited Blue Beetle and the other heroes acquired from Charlton, but the series met with critical disfavor.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n<!-- This paragraph includes speculation about a future event. Please supply a direct quote from the writer or another first-person source, with citation:\nSince Beetle had health problems (including a career-long problem with weight fluctuation and, more recently, heart disease), Dixon's plan was for [[Tim Drake]], the current [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and a fan of the Beetle, to hang up that mantle for a while and replace Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle \u2014 a plan that failed to materialize when Dixon left DC for [[CrossGen Comics]]. -->\n\n====Super Buddies====\n{{Main|Super Buddies}}\nIn July 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and original ''JLI'' artist [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] reunited for the six-issue miniseries ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'', where many of the original JLI characters re-teamed with a storefront office. Beetle, who had grown in maturity, was an important member of this new team known as the \"Super Buddies\". A sequel [[story arc]], ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', was initially slated as a second miniseries, but instead ran, delayed, in ''JLA: Classified'' #4\u20139 (2005).\n\nTed made several appearances in ''[[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]'', at first as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s internet friend and later in person. It was hinted in several issues that Ted had a crush on Oracle. Ted had gone back to his company, but still had many, many problems with it; problems Oracle tried to help resolve. During this time, it was revealed he had a heart condition (he had actually experienced multiple heart attacks while in action without noticing),<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #39 (March 2002)</ref> but this did not stop him from assisting when it was needed. After his [[#Death|death]], resulting in trying to impress Oracle, and ending up being shot in the head by [[Maxwell Lord]], the Birds of Prey visited a statue in [[Valhalla Cemetery]] built in his honor.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #96 (September 2006)</ref> [[Black Canary]] revealed that being in the JLA was only fun when Blue Beetle was there. Oracle revealed that she had had a cyber crush on him.\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\n====Death====\n[[Image:Beatlemax.png|right|220px|thumb|Ted Kord is shot by Maxwell Lord. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]]]]\nIn the 80-page special ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', published on March 30, 2005, Blue Beetle discovers a revived [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA, headquartered in a [[Belgium|Belgian]] castle fortress, where Beetle is captured. Lord reveals to Blue Beetle that his intent is to use the organization to ensure that [[metahuman]]s, including superheroes, will be kept under surveillance and controlled by humans. Lord then gives Beetle an ultimatum to join his organization. When Kord refuses with the reply, \"Rot in hell, Max,\" Lord murders him with a bullet to the head.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThat same story had earlier reiterated that Ted Kord had thought the scarab was destroyed back in ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 6, #18 (1987); however, it had been rediscovered, untouched, in a temple in Egypt and handed over to Kord. It is unclear as to whether or not this is the same scarab created from a piece of future technology magically infused by Nabu the Wizard in the ''Time Masters'' miniseries featuring [[Rip Hunter]]. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] took the scarab upon encountering Kord, fueling speculation about the possibility of the character's return during DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' series. This possibility was dashed when it was asked at the Wizard World convention if Kord would ever return. Writer [[Greg Rucka]] stated, \"There was a breeze blowing through his brain, and he was incinerated. How much clearer can it be?\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070 | title=WWC: Day 2 - DC Crisis Counseling Panel | accessdate=2007-06-22 | date=August 7, 2005 | work=[[Newsarama]] }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Fallout====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis|Character changes during Infinite Crisis}}\nThe death of Ted Kord precipitated the events of ''Infinite Crisis''. [[OMAC (comics)#Brother Eye|Brother Eye]] was reorganized and the [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC project]] restarted. Max Lord was revealed as a villain and took telepathic control of [[Superman]], which led to [[Wonder Woman]], believing that it was the only way, stopping Lord by killing him. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] had warned Ted about [[Lex Luthor]], who had supposedly straddled the worlds of both magic and science. Events in ''Infinite Crisis'' #3 revealed this to be [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], in disguise. [[Booster Gold]] returned to the 25th century. He later returned to the present with [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] to help find Brother Eye. The success of the mission put Booster back into the spotlight and set in motion the events of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{Main|One Year Later}}\nThe young teenager [[Jaime Reyes]] later discovers the scarab and becomes the new Blue Beetle. [[J'onn J'onzz]] has a statue of Ted Kord in his memorial to fallen Justice League members. When recruiting members for the new [[Justice League]], Superman suggests Booster Gold, and Batman responds, \"There are better ways to honor Ted.\"\n\nAfter Ted Kord's demise, [[Shockwave (comics)#DC Comics|Shockwave]], the enforcer of the 1000, is sent to destroy buildings of interest to the still active KORD Industries. Even though [[Kid Devil|Red Devil]] and Reyes stop him, the 1000 manage to take over KORD Industries due to the property value plummeting.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #61 (September 2008)</ref>\n\nIn [[Geoff Johns]]' 2007/2008 ongoing ''Booster Gold'' series, Booster agrees to help [[Rip Hunter]] set right the timeline, but at a cost: Rip must help Booster go back and save Ted.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #1 (October 2007)</ref> Rip Hunter tries to shock Booster Gold into acknowledging his inability to change past \"solidified\" events, tricking him into witnessing [[Barbara Gordon]]'s [[Batman: The Killing Joke|crippling assault]] over and over again.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #3\u20134 (December 2007 \u2013 January 2008)</ref> As Booster Gold prepares to accept his fate, a futuristic Blue Beetle appears with [[Blue Beetle#Dan Garret|Dan Garrett]] and Jaime Reyes in tow to show him how to turn the time around Ted's death into \"malleable time\". Booster Gold betrays Rip Hunter and with the other Beetles' help, rescues Ted Kord from death at the hands of Maxwell Lord.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #6 (March 2008)</ref> The four Beetles escape together in time, the technology used to save Blue Beetle preserving the future events the way they were meant to unfold (thus enabling Jaime to keep his powers and his role as the \"new\" Beetle), with the world at large still believing Ted Kord to be deceased. The story arc \"Blue and Gold\" reveals that this act has altered the present, creating a timeline where Max and his OMACs have turned the world into a police state. The future Blue Beetle is also revealed to actually be [[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]], a supervillain allied with the [[Ultra-Humanite]], [[Despero]], [[Per Degaton]], and [[Supernova (character)|Booster Gold's father]] (under the control of [[Mister Mind]]) as the Time Stealers, a time-traveling supervillain group. Facing the defeat of his former [[Justice League International|JLI]] teammates, the only free heroes in the new timeline, Ted Kord realizes that the only way to restore the timeline is to die the way he was supposed to. As Black Beetle tries to stop him, he grapples the villain and both of them are brought to the past in a Time Sphere. At the end of the issue, a shadowy figure enters an old KORD Industries storehouse, stocked with backup Blue Beetle equipment. The figure then laughs in Kord's distinct \"BWA-HA-HA-HA!\" style.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #1,000,000 (September 2008)</ref>\n\n===Blackest Night===\n[[Image:Black Lantern Blue Beatle (Ted Kord).jpg|left|180px|thumb|Black Lantern Ted Kord.

He lures Booster into the open by targeting [[Supernova (character)|Daniel Carter]] (Supernova) and Rose Levin, Booster's 21st century ancestor. He is able to successfully pierce the Supernova costume shields with a Black Lantern BB gun, and holds Supernova in place while beating Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes) and staving off Skeets' attack until Booster Gold arrives. He then moves in for the kill, hoping to rip out Booster's heart.<ref name=\"Booster Gold v2 26\">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #26 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nHe battles all of them, but is unsuccessful in killing anyone except a neighbor who complained about the noise from the fight. Jaime and Booster Gold remove Rose and Daniel from the scene and head to a KORD Industries warehouse where one of Ted Kord's hidden bases is located to collect special equipment to fight the Black Lantern. Booster Gold discovers that even though the doors were genetically coded, someone had accessed Ted Kord's hidden base a few months before his remains were reanimated. However to Booster's knowledge, only two people, had authorization to access it: Booster Gold and Ted Kord himself. They then head back, where Ted's corpse battles Booster until he is attacked by a light blast from a gun designed by Ted Kord himself, tuned to simulate the emotional spectrum. Separated from the ring, Booster Gold seizes his remains before the ring can reanimate them, takes them into the Time Sphere, and deposits them in a small grave at Vanishing Point Fortress.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #27 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Brightest Day===\nMaxwell Lord, the former head of Justice League International and the murderer of Ted Kord, is restored to life and uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to erase his existence from the minds of almost everyone on the planet.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> He also influences the superhero community into believing Ted committed suicide, which enrages Booster Gold, one of the few who could remember Max's existence and also the best friend of Ted.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> Later, [[Power Girl]] regains her memories of Max and exhumes Ted's corpse in order to have [[Dick Grayson]] examine it.

At the beginning of the story, [[Lex Luthor]] threatens the owner of Kord Industries, Thomas Kord, and his entire family and company, as part of a plan to acquire the company but the helicopter loses control, and crashes into the side of [[LexCorp]] Tower. Lex later undergoes a change of heart after finding a message appearing on his phone's screen from the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]: \"THIS WORLD IS OURS.\" Lex looks up to see that Thomas Kord is still alive, but dangling precariously from the helicopter's wreckage over a sheer drop to the street. He tries to save him but [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] accidentally causes Kord to fall to his death.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> Lex Luthor later promises Ted Kord (depicted as a grad student) that he will not be acquiring Kord Industries despite Ted's desire to sell it to him.

After [[Jaime Reyes]] approached Kord for help to get rid of the Scarab, Kord is trying to figure out what the Scarab can do and help as many people in the process. However, Kord is warned by [[Doctor Fate]] that he does not know what he's dealing with as the Scarab is not xenotechnology but magic.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' #1 (2016).</ref> In ''Blue Beetle'', Ted Kord is established to have been Blue Beetle some time in the past, having worked alongside other heroes such as [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]].<ref>''Blue Beetle'' #1 (September 2016).</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Heroes in Crisis]]'', Ted Kord as Blue Beetle breaks out [[Booster Gold]], who is one of the main suspects of the murders at the mental health institution Sanctuary, from a cell in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Heroes in Crisis'' #4.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Ted Kord as Blue Beetle appears alongside [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], the [[Question (character)|Question]], and [[Captain Atom]] in the Bug airship as they travel to Mars.

The collection includes nearly all of the Charlton appearances of the [[Question (character)|Question]], as well as a brief appearance by [[Captain Atom]]. Volume 1 of the archive contained nearly all of Captain Atom's Charlton stories and a brief appearance by Nightshade.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTed Kord had no superpowers; he possess a genius-level intellect, with an IQ of 192.<ref name=\"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\">''Countdown to Infinite Crisis'' (March 2005)</ref> He was proficient in numerous sciences such as chemistry, physics, engineering, aircraft, and solar tech, as well as an understanding of alien tech.

To prevent being forcibly unmasked, especially if rendered unconscious, Kord's cowl had a lock mechanism that only opened when he touched the mask under his jaw with a chip in his glove, which would at least force an enemy to perform the more troublesome task of cutting through the material to unmask him.\n* He also created a power armor suit for his friend Booster Gold. The suit contained a fully functioning artificial arm and also provided life-support for Booster as he recovered from potentially fatal injuries. He later converted a suit of alien power armor for Booster to use.\n* His BB gun was a handheld weapon that could blind villains with a flash of light, or knock them back with a compressed air blast capable of felling a charging rhino. The original BB gun was designed with a security feature so that it would function only when the Blue Beetle held it, becoming inactive without contact with special circuitry in the Beetle costume's gloves. The BB gun is solar powered.<ref>''Justice League America Annual #6 (1992)''</ref>\n* Blue Beetle's [[airship]], the \"Bug\", contained high tech equipment, could electrify or magnetize its hull, fire electrical energy, and fly at 600&nbsp;mph. All models had booster jets hidden under the shell of the Bug. The boosters on the first two models could speed the Bug up to the speed of sound for a short period of time; no time limit was ever given for how long the burst lasted. Later models of the boosters were used for intercontinental travel at supersonic speed. It was also 90% solar powered. Later models also had energy weapons of various types, from lasers to plasma. The last two models were capable of reaching orbit<ref>''The L.A.W.'' #6 (February 2000)</ref><ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref> and all models could operate underwater. No depth was ever given that they could go to, but one model Bug was seen operating on the sea floor after going through an underwater volcano.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #16 (August 2007)</ref> All models were remotely controllable from controls built into Kord's gloves.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n* He also built flight pads similar to [[Mister Miracle]]'s flight discs used throughout the entire ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' run<ref>''Extreme Justice'' #0\u201318</ref> and claimed to Barbara Gordon that he could keep the Birds of Prey jet flying 24-7 with technology based on the [[New Gods]]' [[Mother Box]]es.<ref name=\"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\"/>\n* As a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], Blue Beetle is equipped with a \"decayed\", damaged version of the Bug, and black, [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|power ring]]-derived constructs of his Blue Beetle suit and his BB gun. This iteration of the BB gun is an aggressive, rather than a defensive, weapon, able to pierce the powerful shields in the [[Supernova (character)|Supernova]] suit.<ref name=\"Booster Gold v2 26\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n* He appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', as one of Batman's three generals (alongside [[Oliver Queen]], and [[Dinah Lance]]).<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #1</ref> His appearance has been updated with the Scarab making him look like a [[knight]]. He is killed in the climax.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4</ref>\n* He appeared in the 1997 [[Elseworlds]] title, ''[[Justice Riders]]'', as a Wild West-era inventor who teams up with Booster Gold.<ref>''Justice Riders'' #1</ref>\n* In ''Justice League America Annual'' #5, a future version has let his health, weight, and business ventures fall apart. He has sold the rights to his name. The stress causes a psychotic breakdown and he attacks his former team.<ref>''Justice League America Annual'' #5 (1991)</ref>\n* Daniel Dreiberg (the second [[List of Watchmen characters#Nite Owl|Nite Owl]]) is a stand-in for Ted Kord and appears in DC Comics' ''[[Watchmen]]'' maxiseries, created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], whose protagonists are analogues of the Charlton Comics characters acquired by DC. The original Charlton characters were to appear in the series; however, due to DC's plans to use the characters in the mainstream DC Universe, analogues were created.\n* In the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', Ted Kord makes appearance on [[Crime Syndicate of America|Earth-3]], in a [[comedy club]] where the [[Joker (character)|Jokester]] is playing.<ref>''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'' #1</ref> In the spin-off, ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' features a version an anthropomorphic pet Blue Beetle of Mr. and Mrs. Kord in the conjurer world of [[Earth-33]], named Ted. He along with 2 other versions of the Blue Beetle: Daniel Garrett (from [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-39]]) and the Scarab ([[Earth-26]]) are forced to fight for a role in [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]'s army.<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #1</ref> He is later devoured by the Scarab.<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #2</ref>\n* In the comic tie-in to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' sequel ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Kord was retired as Blue Beetle and training his successor, Jaime Reyes. He is requested by Batman to assist in helping rebuild the world after Superman's Regime put it in a difficult place. He agrees to come to Batman's meeting, but is visited by Booster Gold, who reveals that he's about to die soon and Gold couldn't do anything to stop it. He is kidnapped by Ra's Al Ghul's henchmen along with a number of billionaires who own companies that Ra's deems environmentally destructive. Ra's broadcasts their buildings destroyed live and forces everyone including Jaime to watch Ted and the other billionaires killed by Orca and Killer Croc. When Booster Gold returns to Ted at his dying breath, Ted tells him to look after Jaime before dying from his wounds.\n* In ''Dark Multiverse: Infinite Crisis'', Kord manages to turn the tables on Maxwell Lord and kill him, subsequently taking Lord's position as the Black King. Using his own insight and his new access to Brother Eye, Kord is able to stop the OMAC assault, retrieve the Black Diamond before it can possess Jean Loring, and track down the new Secret Society of Super-Villains, as well as preventing the Raan-Thanagar War. When Kord manages to track down and confront Alexander Luthor and Superboy-Prime, Luthor kills the Earth-2 Superman and Lois before Prime kills him, allowing Kord to convince Superboy-Prime to help him in his own plans. However, when Brother Eye identifies the Justice League as the greatest threat to humanity as escalating superhumans lead to a rise in supervillain activity, Kord is convinced to cybernetically augment himself with the OMAC virus and infect other heroes with it to be a perfect peacekeeping force, escalating to the point of surrendering his own emotions after the OMAC system kills Booster Gold for trying to talk him down. As Kord's forces spread across Earth, the Tempus Fuginaut who observes the Dark Multiverse muses that Kord died a hero in the world we know and fell to villainy in this world due to the nature of the Dark Multiverse, but wonders if Kord would have been able to hold on to his better nature if he had lived past his original death.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ted Kord appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RrObyQ3XzcY/ST-oDKmY00I/AAAAAAAAsUE/4dNL70spd2c/s1600-h/scifi+preview+4.jpg | title=Batman: The Brave and the Bold | work=TV Guide}}</ref> In the episode \"Fall of the Blue Beetle!\", he appears in flashbacks working together with [[Batman]]. When he is unable to get the scarab to work, he lends it to his scientist uncle Dr. Jarvis Kord (voiced by [[Tim Matheson]]) to activate. However, the insane Jarvis planned to use it to power Blue Beetle robots to take over Hub City, and Ted recruits Batman to help get it back. When Jarvis activates a rocket to send the robots to different parts of Hub City, Kord enters the rocket before it blasts off and blows it up, stopping the robot invasion, but he is killed in the process. Sometime after Ted's death, Jarvis takes his identity to trick [[Jaime Reyes]] into helping him on Science Island. However, Jarvis's master plan is foiled by Batman and Jaime. In the episode \"Menace of the Madniks!\", [[Booster Gold]], having missed Ted since his death, travels back in time to help Ted defeat his old foes, the Madniks (which resemble the Madmen of the original series). Though the mission appears successful, Booster returns to the present to finds Hub City in ruins and Batman battling terrifying evolved forms of the Madniks. Batman and Booster together return to the mission and manage to revert the Madniks to their original forms with Kord's help. Batman and Booster say a final goodbye to Ted, immediately before Batman of Ted's own time arrives to enlist him for what will be Kord's final mission.\n\n[[File:Ted Kord (Smallville).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Sebastian Spence]] as Ted Kord in ''[[Smallville]]'']]\n* Ted Kord appears in season ten of ''[[Smallville]]'', played by [[Sebastian Spence]]. In the episode \"Booster\", it is revealed that Kord never takes the Blue Beetle identity from Dan Garret (who died after failing to control the scarab). Kord obtains the device and hopes to utilize its potential for good, but it later escapes and possesses Jaime Reyes. Kord then hires Booster Gold to find it. Kord keeps Booster on his payroll after the hero helps Reyes control the scarab-enhanced powers.\n* Blue Beetle appears in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. He joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman about being called \"Super Friends\". In his part, he states that no one pokes the Super Friends page on [[Facebook]].\n* Ted Kord is alluded in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]''. In \"Salvage\", Jaime Reyes stated that Ted was the creator of the Scarab's A.I. component. It is also mentioned that Kord was killed by [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]] ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors) which led to Jaime taking up the Blue Beetle mantle. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] states that Ted was a good man. In \"Satisfaction\", a holographic memorial of Kord is present in Mount Justice. In \"Before the Dawn\", Jamie (during a dream sequence) is shown finding the Sacrab after an explosion at Kord Industries. In \"Intervention\", [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] and [[Zatanna]] explain the scarab's history (having been pieced together in the previous months) to Jaime (after freeing Blue Beetle and Green Beetle from the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]'s control through a mystical ritual first performed thousands of years earlier). Dan Garrett had originally found the scarab in an archaeological dig which was used to be the first Blue Beetle, eventually passing the object on to his protege. Ted realized the scarab was not a mystical artifact but an alien device. As such, Kord refused to use the device, but was inspired by his mentor to be the second Blue Beetle anyway. Having kept the scarab hidden for years, Ted died trying to stop [[Sportsmaster]] and [[Deathstroke]] from stealing the object for The Light after which ended up with Jaime after Kord Industries' resulting explosion.\n* Ted Kord is mentioned in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. In a flashback of the season one episode \"The Undertaking\", [[Moira Queen (Arrowverse)|Moira Queen]] remarks how quiet Robert Queen is after attending Kord's fundraiser. His company, Kord Industries, also made an sporadic appearances throughout the series. Originally, [[Andrew Kreisberg]] revealed that his Blue Beetle alias was meant to appear during season three but were told that \"DC has other plans for [Ted Kord]\" and instead were offered the chance to use [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] which \"worked even better\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/26/sdcc-2014-arrow-panel-teases-oracle-whats-to-come-in-season-3|title=SDCC 2014: ARROW PANEL TEASES ORACLE & WHAT'S TO COME IN SEASON 3|first=Roth|last=Cornet|work=IGN|date= July 26, 2014|accessdate= July 26, 2014}}</ref> \n* Ted Kord is again referenced in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

Kord's signature equipment was his bug-shaped personal aircraft, which he entered and exited typically with a cable suspended from the cockpit. He also generally eschewed personal weaponry, except for a pistol that made a blinding flash of light and, additionally, a strong airblast to gain the advantage when he closed in for hand-to-hand combat.\n\n[[Image:BlueBeetle3.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Blue Beetle'' #3 (October 1967).

Ted was revealed as a former student of Dan Garrett, and when they were investigating Ted's uncle, Jarvis Kord, they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth.

They would also follow up on the hinted android in stasis from the Charlton series, which would eventually become \"[[Carapax]], the Indestructible Man\".\n\nIn his monthly, solo series, Ted Kord was shown as an industrialist, the owner of KORD Industries; Which he took over from his father Thomas Kord and transformed it from a small R & D company to a scientific industry rivaling S.T.A.R. Labs Upon joining the newly formed Justice League (following the events in LEGENDS 1\u20136) Ted was more often portrayed as a second string joke. He was short on money, leading to his entering \"get-rich-quick\" schemes with [[Booster Gold]], A brief appearance in ''JLA: Year One'' showed the young Ted working in Kord Industries R&D, where he designed the JLA HQ security system. Upon meeting the heroes, he thought, \"Screw the family business. I want to be one of those guys,\" possibly explaining the company's fluctuating status since he took over. In recent comics, it has been implied that KORD Industries has become a subsidiary of [[Wayne Enterprises]], headed by Bruce Wayne (also known as [[Batman]]).\n\n====Joining the Justice League====\n{{Main|Justice League International}}\n[[Image:Jli issue8 cover.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''JLI'' #8 (December 1987). Art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] (pencils) and [[Al Gordon]] (inks)]]\nBlue Beetle is probably best known as the wisecracking member of [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' lighthearted, five-year run on various ''Justice League of America'' titles (notably ''Justice League International''), where he was memorably partnered with fellow third-string hero [[Booster Gold]], and the two quickly became best friends. Among fans, they were known collectively as the \"Blue and Gold\" team.{{fact?|date=April 2015}} For a while, Beetle grappled with a weight problem, but with sheer determination and coaching from the hero [[General Glory]], as well as competing against [[Power Girl]], he defeated it. After Giffen and DeMatteis left, ''Justice League America'' continued to run until issue #113. [[Dan Jurgens]] tied \"[[The Death of Superman]]\" storyline into ''JLA'', in which [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] left Blue Beetle in a coma during his murderous rampage, as well as a six-inch scar on the back of his skull. Beetle and Booster both subsequently joined the short-lived Justice League offshoot known as [[Extreme Justice]].<ref name=\"dc-extr\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | contribution=Extreme Justice | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=117 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>\n\nBlue Beetle then entered a period of relative obscurity. The [[miniseries]] ''The LAW (Living Assault Weapons)'' reunited Blue Beetle and the other heroes acquired from Charlton, but the series met with critical disfavor.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n<!-- This paragraph includes speculation about a future event. Please supply a direct quote from the writer or another first-person source, with citation:\nSince Beetle had health problems (including a career-long problem with weight fluctuation and, more recently, heart disease), Dixon's plan was for [[Tim Drake]], the current [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and a fan of the Beetle, to hang up that mantle for a while and replace Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle \u2014 a plan that failed to materialize when Dixon left DC for [[CrossGen Comics]]. -->\n\n====Super Buddies====\n{{Main|Super Buddies}}\nIn July 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and original ''JLI'' artist [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] reunited for the six-issue miniseries ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'', where many of the original JLI characters re-teamed with a storefront office. Beetle, who had grown in maturity, was an important member of this new team known as the \"Super Buddies\". A sequel [[story arc]], ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', was initially slated as a second miniseries, but instead ran, delayed, in ''JLA: Classified'' #4\u20139 (2005).\n\nTed made several appearances in ''[[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]'', at first as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s internet friend and later in person. It was hinted in several issues that Ted had a crush on Oracle. Ted had gone back to his company, but still had many, many problems with it; problems Oracle tried to help resolve. During this time, it was revealed he had a heart condition (he had actually experienced multiple heart attacks while in action without noticing),<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #39 (March 2002)</ref> but this did not stop him from assisting when it was needed. After his [[#Death|death]], resulting in trying to impress Oracle, and ending up being shot in the head by [[Maxwell Lord]], the Birds of Prey visited a statue in [[Valhalla Cemetery]] built in his honor.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #96 (September 2006)</ref> [[Black Canary]] revealed that being in the JLA was only fun when Blue Beetle was there. Oracle revealed that she had had a cyber crush on him.\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\n====Death====\n[[Image:Beatlemax.png|right|220px|thumb|Ted Kord is shot by Maxwell Lord. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]]]]\nIn the 80-page special ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', published on March 30, 2005, Blue Beetle discovers a revived [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA, headquartered in a [[Belgium|Belgian]] castle fortress, where Beetle is captured. Lord reveals to Blue Beetle that his intent is to use the organization to ensure that [[metahuman]]s, including superheroes, will be kept under surveillance and controlled by humans. Lord then gives Beetle an ultimatum to join his organization. When Kord refuses with the reply, \"Rot in hell, Max,\" Lord murders him with a bullet to the head.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThat same story had earlier reiterated that Ted Kord had thought the scarab was destroyed back in ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 6, #18 (1987); however, it had been rediscovered, untouched, in a temple in Egypt and handed over to Kord. It is unclear as to whether or not this is the same scarab created from a piece of future technology magically infused by Nabu the Wizard in the ''Time Masters'' miniseries featuring [[Rip Hunter]]. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] took the scarab upon encountering Kord, fueling speculation about the possibility of the character's return during DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' series. This possibility was dashed when it was asked at the Wizard World convention if Kord would ever return. Writer [[Greg Rucka]] stated, \"There was a breeze blowing through his brain, and he was incinerated. How much clearer can it be?\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070 | title=WWC: Day 2 - DC Crisis Counseling Panel | accessdate=2007-06-22 | date=August 7, 2005 | work=[[Newsarama]] }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Fallout====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis|Character changes during Infinite Crisis}}\nThe death of Ted Kord precipitated the events of ''Infinite Crisis''. [[OMAC (comics)#Brother Eye|Brother Eye]] was reorganized and the [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC project]] restarted. Max Lord was revealed as a villain and took telepathic control of [[Superman]], which led to [[Wonder Woman]], believing that it was the only way, stopping Lord by killing him. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] had warned Ted about [[Lex Luthor]], who had supposedly straddled the worlds of both magic and science. Events in ''Infinite Crisis'' #3 revealed this to be [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], in disguise. [[Booster Gold]] returned to the 25th century. He later returned to the present with [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] to help find Brother Eye. The success of the mission put Booster back into the spotlight and set in motion the events of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{Main|One Year Later}}\nThe young teenager [[Jaime Reyes]] later discovers the scarab and becomes the new Blue Beetle.

The story arc \"Blue and Gold\" reveals that this act has altered the present, creating a timeline where Max and his OMACs have turned the world into a police state. The future Blue Beetle is also revealed to actually be [[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]], a supervillain allied with the [[Ultra-Humanite]], [[Despero]], [[Per Degaton]], and [[Supernova (character)|Booster Gold's father]] (under the control of [[Mister Mind]]) as the Time Stealers, a time-traveling supervillain group. Facing the defeat of his former [[Justice League International|JLI]] teammates, the only free heroes in the new timeline, Ted Kord realizes that the only way to restore the timeline is to die the way he was supposed to. As Black Beetle tries to stop him, he grapples the villain and both of them are brought to the past in a Time Sphere. At the end of the issue, a shadowy figure enters an old KORD Industries storehouse, stocked with backup Blue Beetle equipment.

Booster Gold discovers that even though the doors were genetically coded, someone had accessed Ted Kord's hidden base a few months before his remains were reanimated. However to Booster's knowledge, only two people, had authorization to access it: Booster Gold and Ted Kord himself. They then head back, where Ted's corpse battles Booster until he is attacked by a light blast from a gun designed by Ted Kord himself, tuned to simulate the emotional spectrum. Separated from the ring, Booster Gold seizes his remains before the ring can reanimate them, takes them into the Time Sphere, and deposits them in a small grave at Vanishing Point Fortress.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #27 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Brightest Day===\nMaxwell Lord, the former head of Justice League International and the murderer of Ted Kord, is restored to life and uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to erase his existence from the minds of almost everyone on the planet.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> He also influences the superhero community into believing Ted committed suicide, which enrages Booster Gold, one of the few who could remember Max's existence and also the best friend of Ted.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> Later, [[Power Girl]] regains her memories of Max and exhumes Ted's corpse in order to have [[Dick Grayson]] examine it.

At the beginning of the story, [[Lex Luthor]] threatens the owner of Kord Industries, Thomas Kord, and his entire family and company, as part of a plan to acquire the company but the helicopter loses control, and crashes into the side of [[LexCorp]] Tower. Lex later undergoes a change of heart after finding a message appearing on his phone's screen from the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]: \"THIS WORLD IS OURS.\" Lex looks up to see that Thomas Kord is still alive, but dangling precariously from the helicopter's wreckage over a sheer drop to the street.

To prevent being forcibly unmasked, especially if rendered unconscious, Kord's cowl had a lock mechanism that only opened when he touched the mask under his jaw with a chip in his glove, which would at least force an enemy to perform the more troublesome task of cutting through the material to unmask him.\n* He also created a power armor suit for his friend Booster Gold. The suit contained a fully functioning artificial arm and also provided life-support for Booster as he recovered from potentially fatal injuries. He later converted a suit of alien power armor for Booster to use.\n* His BB gun was a handheld weapon that could blind villains with a flash of light, or knock them back with a compressed air blast capable of felling a charging rhino. The original BB gun was designed with a security feature so that it would function only when the Blue Beetle held it, becoming inactive without contact with special circuitry in the Beetle costume's gloves. The BB gun is solar powered.<ref>''Justice League America Annual #6 (1992)''</ref>\n* Blue Beetle's [[airship]], the \"Bug\", contained high tech equipment, could electrify or magnetize its hull, fire electrical energy, and fly at 600&nbsp;mph. All models had booster jets hidden under the shell of the Bug. The boosters on the first two models could speed the Bug up to the speed of sound for a short period of time; no time limit was ever given for how long the burst lasted. Later models of the boosters were used for intercontinental travel at supersonic speed. It was also 90% solar powered. Later models also had energy weapons of various types, from lasers to plasma. The last two models were capable of reaching orbit<ref>''The L.A.W.'' #6 (February 2000)</ref><ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref> and all models could operate underwater. No depth was ever given that they could go to, but one model Bug was seen operating on the sea floor after going through an underwater volcano.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #16 (August 2007)</ref> All models were remotely controllable from controls built into Kord's gloves.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n* He also built flight pads similar to [[Mister Miracle]]'s flight discs used throughout the entire ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' run<ref>''Extreme Justice'' #0\u201318</ref> and claimed to Barbara Gordon that he could keep the Birds of Prey jet flying 24-7 with technology based on the [[New Gods]]' [[Mother Box]]es.<ref name=\"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\"/>\n* As a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], Blue Beetle is equipped with a \"decayed\", damaged version of the Bug, and black, [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|power ring]]-derived constructs of his Blue Beetle suit and his BB gun. This iteration of the BB gun is an aggressive, rather than a defensive, weapon, able to pierce the powerful shields in the [[Supernova (character)|Supernova]] suit.<ref name=\"Booster Gold v2 26\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n* He appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', as one of Batman's three generals (alongside [[Oliver Queen]], and [[Dinah Lance]]).<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #1</ref> His appearance has been updated with the Scarab making him look like a [[knight]].

The original Charlton characters were to appear in the series; however, due to DC's plans to use the characters in the mainstream DC Universe, analogues were created.\n* In the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', Ted Kord makes appearance on [[Crime Syndicate of America|Earth-3]], in a [[comedy club]] where the [[Joker (character)|Jokester]] is playing.<ref>''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'' #1</ref> In the spin-off, ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' features a version an anthropomorphic pet Blue Beetle of Mr. and Mrs. Kord in the conjurer world of [[Earth-33]], named Ted.

He is requested by Batman to assist in helping rebuild the world after Superman's Regime put it in a difficult place. He agrees to come to Batman's meeting, but is visited by Booster Gold, who reveals that he's about to die soon and Gold couldn't do anything to stop it. He is kidnapped by Ra's Al Ghul's henchmen along with a number of billionaires who own companies that Ra's deems environmentally destructive. Ra's broadcasts their buildings destroyed live and forces everyone including Jaime to watch Ted and the other billionaires killed by Orca and Killer Croc. When Booster Gold returns to Ted at his dying breath, Ted tells him to look after Jaime before dying from his wounds.\n* In ''Dark Multiverse: Infinite Crisis'', Kord manages to turn the tables on Maxwell Lord and kill him, subsequently taking Lord's position as the Black King. Using his own insight and his new access to Brother Eye, Kord is able to stop the OMAC assault, retrieve the Black Diamond before it can possess Jean Loring, and track down the new Secret Society of Super-Villains, as well as preventing the Raan-Thanagar War. When Kord manages to track down and confront Alexander Luthor and Superboy-Prime, Luthor kills the Earth-2 Superman and Lois before Prime kills him, allowing Kord to convince Superboy-Prime to help him in his own plans. However, when Brother Eye identifies the Justice League as the greatest threat to humanity as escalating superhumans lead to a rise in supervillain activity, Kord is convinced to cybernetically augment himself with the OMAC virus and infect other heroes with it to be a perfect peacekeeping force, escalating to the point of surrendering his own emotions after the OMAC system kills Booster Gold for trying to talk him down. As Kord's forces spread across Earth, the Tempus Fuginaut who observes the Dark Multiverse muses that Kord died a hero in the world we know and fell to villainy in this world due to the nature of the Dark Multiverse, but wonders if Kord would have been able to hold on to his better nature if he had lived past his original death.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ted Kord appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RrObyQ3XzcY/ST-oDKmY00I/AAAAAAAAsUE/4dNL70spd2c/s1600-h/scifi+preview+4.jpg | title=Batman: The Brave and the Bold | work=TV Guide}}</ref> In the episode \"Fall of the Blue Beetle!\", he appears in flashbacks working together with [[Batman]]. When he is unable to get the scarab to work, he lends it to his scientist uncle Dr. Jarvis Kord (voiced by [[Tim Matheson]]) to activate. However, the insane Jarvis planned to use it to power Blue Beetle robots to take over Hub City, and Ted recruits Batman to help get it back. When Jarvis activates a rocket to send the robots to different parts of Hub City, Kord enters the rocket before it blasts off and blows it up, stopping the robot invasion, but he is killed in the process. Sometime after Ted's death, Jarvis takes his identity to trick [[Jaime Reyes]] into helping him on Science Island. However, Jarvis's master plan is foiled by Batman and Jaime. In the episode \"Menace of the Madniks!\", [[Booster Gold]], having missed Ted since his death, travels back in time to help Ted defeat his old foes, the Madniks (which resemble the Madmen of the original series). Though the mission appears successful, Booster returns to the present to finds Hub City in ruins and Batman battling terrifying evolved forms of the Madniks. Batman and Booster together return to the mission and manage to revert the Madniks to their original forms with Kord's help. Batman and Booster say a final goodbye to Ted, immediately before Batman of Ted's own time arrives to enlist him for what will be Kord's final mission.\n\n[[File:Ted Kord (Smallville).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Sebastian Spence]] as Ted Kord in ''[[Smallville]]'']]\n* Ted Kord appears in season ten of ''[[Smallville]]'', played by [[Sebastian Spence]]. In the episode \"Booster\", it is revealed that Kord never takes the Blue Beetle identity from Dan Garret (who died after failing to control the scarab). Kord obtains the device and hopes to utilize its potential for good, but it later escapes and possesses Jaime Reyes. Kord then hires Booster Gold to find it. Kord keeps Booster on his payroll after the hero helps Reyes control the scarab-enhanced powers.\n* Blue Beetle appears in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. He joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman about being called \"Super Friends\". In his part, he states that no one pokes the Super Friends page on [[Facebook]].\n* Ted Kord is alluded in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]''. In \"Salvage\", Jaime Reyes stated that Ted was the creator of the Scarab's A.I. component. It is also mentioned that Kord was killed by [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]] ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors) which led to Jaime taking up the Blue Beetle mantle. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] states that Ted was a good man. In \"Satisfaction\", a holographic memorial of Kord is present in Mount Justice. In \"Before the Dawn\", Jamie (during a dream sequence) is shown finding the Sacrab after an explosion at Kord Industries. In \"Intervention\", [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] and [[Zatanna]] explain the scarab's history (having been pieced together in the previous months) to Jaime (after freeing Blue Beetle and Green Beetle from the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]'s control through a mystical ritual first performed thousands of years earlier). Dan Garrett had originally found the scarab in an archaeological dig which was used to be the first Blue Beetle, eventually passing the object on to his protege.
