Klehr is known for his books on the subject of the [[United States|American]] [[Communism|Communist]] movement, and on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[espionage]] in America (many written jointly with [[John Earl Haynes]]).\n\n==Early years==\nHe was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He received his [[Bachelor's]] degree from [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in 1967. He received his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1971, after defending a dissertation entitled ''The Theory of American Exceptionalism.''<ref>Harvey Klehr, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/theory-of-american-exceptionalism/oclc/35634126 The Theory of American Exceptionalism.]'' University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1971.

New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2010; pg. x.</ref> In 2010, Klehr wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...I originally intended to study traditional American politics, but became distracted by the upheavals of the era. I considered myself on the political left, but hardly a revolutionary. Some of my friends and classmates, however, were associated with the [[Southern Student Organizing Committee]] (SSOC), a spin-off of [[Students for a Democratic Society]]....<br /><br />\n\"Two political events from those tumultuous years gave me my lifetime research agenda. During the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], a number of radicals, including some I knew, supported [[George Wallace]] for president. They certainly had no sympathy for the Alabama governor, but argued that his election would precipitate an American revolution. Their rationale was that a dose of [[fascism]] would prepare the way for American radicalism....<br /><br />\n\"After the [[Operation Menu|American incursion into Cambodia]] in 1970, student protestors held a mass meeting on the Chapel Hill campus. A number of speakers called for a student strike to shut down the university. My advisor, Dr Lewis Lipsitz, had been one of the most prominent leftists on campus for many years....

The Lundbergs were second-generation Swedish (via Chicago) immigrants and pioneer settlers of Silverhill, Alabama.[[George D. Lundberg#%20ftn32|[32]]] Young George was gifted intellectually and, from the time he was six years old, he knew he wanted to be a doctor. After brief consideration of a violin career in Chicago, he finished high school (Robertsdale, Alabama) in 1948 at the age of 15, having skipped the 5th, 8th, and 11th grades. Lundberg first married in 1956 (until 1983); from 1983 to the present day he has been married to Patricia Lorimer Lundberg. He has 5 children, 11 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. When not working, Lundberg reads, hikes, cooks, swims, and is an enthusiast of the visual and performing arts and Alabama football.[[George D.

In the past, it was not uncommon for a would-be engineer to earn an engineering degree as their first and only college degree. But since [[World War II]] this has fallen out of favor and it becomes continually more difficult to find a school that offers this option.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nA degree with some form of the word ''engineer'' or ''engineering'' in the title is not necessarily an engineer's degree. Particularly, a \"[[Master of Engineering]]\" (M.Eng.) or \"[[Bachelor of Engineering]]\" (B.Eng.) degree is ''not'' an Engineer's degree, nor is any other bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree. Rather, the engineer's degree is in a category of its own. For example, a student with a B.S. and M.S. in [[electrical engineering]] might next earn the degree ''Electrical Engineer''. The person would then have a B.S. in E.E., a M.S. in E.E. and an E.E. degree. The former two are degrees in engineering and only the latter degree is actually an engineer's degree.\n\n== Latin America ==\nIn [[Latin America]], a degree or title of \"Ingeniero\" is awarded after completing five years of college.  This may be translated as \"Engineer\", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state [[licence]] to legally practice in the field or a professional certification outside the academic environment.\n\n=== Chile ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''T\u00edtulo Profesional'' (professional title), ''Mag\u00edster'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate or Ph.D).\n\nIn this case, the ''engineer'' status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (T\u00edtulo Profesional en Ingenier\u00eda). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study.\n\nAs in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a [[doctoral degree]]. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree.\n\n=== Mexico ===\n{{see also|Licentiate (degree)#Mexico}}\nIn [[Mexico]], the educational system follows closely that of the [[United States]]. University education is structured in three cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Maestr\u00eda'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate).\n\nThe ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'') that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'') in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceead.org.mx/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=137818|title=Ley del Ejercicio Profesional|last=LA H. XLIX LEGISLATURA DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor engineering, completing all taught courses of a ''Licenciatura'' does not automatically award the graduate the title and [[licence]] of ''Ingeniero''; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix ''Ingenier\u00eda'' attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the [[diploma]] and title of Engineer and the professional credential, after getting their professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'').\n\nDegrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a [[master's degree]] or in exceptional cases, directly into a [[doctoral degree]].\n\n== Europe (prior to the Bologna Process) ==\nPrior to the [[Bologna Process]], In most countries of [[continental Europe]], universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing [[secondary education]] and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a [[doctorate]].\n\nFollowing German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplom]]''. In addition to [[Germany]] itself, this system was common in states like [[Albania]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\n=== Belgium ===\nIn Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees:\n\n* \"Burgerlijk Ingenieur\" / \"Ing\u00e9nieur civil\" or \"Master of Science in Engineering\" (abbrev. \"ir.\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by [[List of universities in Belgium|universities]].\n* \"Bio-ingenieur\" / \"Bioing\u00e9nieur\" or \"Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering\" (abbrev. \"ir.\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by universities.\n* \"Industrieel Ingenieur\" / \"Ing\u00e9nieur industriel\" or \"Master of Science in Industrial Engineering\" (abbrev. \"Ing.\") - five years study in [[French Community of Belgium]] (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.) or four years of study in the [[Flemish Community of Belgium]] (3 BSc. + 1 MSc.), delivered by universities.\n\nNames are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by law.\nBelgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== Belarus and Ukraine ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], the degree is ''\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u0456\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440'' (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study.\n\n=== Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Ex-Yugoslavia ===\nIn [[Croatia]], the old system included the engineer's degrees ''diplomirani in\u017eenjer'' (abbr. ''dipl.ing.'') which was awarded by university faculties and a lower ranked engineer's degree ''in\u017eenjer'' (abbr. ''ing.'') which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the [[Netherlands]]. The old ''dipl.ing.'' degree could later be upgraded to a ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr.'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and then a ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr.'', [[Doctorate]]). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the abbreviation is ''dipl.in\u017e''.<ref>Ivan Klajn, Re\u010dnik jezi\u010dkih nedoumica (NOLIT, Beograd)</ref> Serbian titles of ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr'', [[Doctorate]]) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.\n\n=== Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called ''in\u017cynier'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), ''in\u017einier'' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) or ''in\u017een\u00fdr'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]) and the abbreviation is ''in\u017c.'' in [[Poland]] and ''Ing.'' in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], which may be written before the person's name.\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the degree of ''Ing.'' is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]''.\n\nIn [[Poland]], the degree of ''in\u017cynier'' is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the ''[[licencjat]]'' in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A ''magister in\u017cynier'' (abbreviated ''mgr in\u017c.'') refers to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]'', after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were \"in\u017cynier\" studies that lasted for four years and afterward one could obtain the \"magister\" title in two years of studies\u2014the total of six years resulted in two degrees, \"magister\" and \"in\u017cynier\". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the \"magister in\u017cynier\" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the \"magister in\u017cynier\" (mgr in\u017c. before the name) was the equivalent degree with \"in\u017cynier\" designating the professional level and \"magister\" designating the academic level.\nAfter the [[Bologna process]] the first level is \"in\u017cynier,\" obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before and \"masters\" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that \"magister in\u017cynier\" be made a basis for professional rights.\n\n=== Finland ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[diplomi-insin\u00f6\u00f6ri]]'' and abbreviated ''dipl.ins.'', ''DI'' or ''M.Sc.(Tech.)''. It is possible to obtain after five years of studying or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' (''B.Sc.(Tech.)'') degree.\n\nThe degree of ''[[insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (AMK)]]'' is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]''), similar to a German ''[[Fachhochschule]]'', but it is not interchangeable with the academic ''tekniikan kandidaatti''.\n\nDue to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called ''insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (ylempi AMK)'' or \"engineer (higher amk)\" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of ''insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (AMK)'' and further studies.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n\n\nIn France, there are two main ways to become an engineer:\n\n* Have a ''[[Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur]]'', delivered by the French ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' in engineering.\n* Have a master's degree in science, delivered by public [[List of public universities in France|universities]].\n\nThe ''[[Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur]]'' is a postgraduate degree in engineering usually awarded by the French ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]''.\n\nEach holder of the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur'' is conferred the title of ''ing\u00e9nieur dipl\u00f4m\u00e9'' (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term ''ing\u00e9nieur'' (engineer) which is less-regulated. The ''dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'' is recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States and in the countries of the European Union (also in France).\n\nMost ''grandes \u00e9coles'' give the opportunity to their students to join a double degree with a University (in France or abroad). Furthermore, ''Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur'' graduates can pursue a selective PhD after their engineering studies to later join academia or an industrial R&D department.\n\nAny institution issuing the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur'' must be accredited by the ''[[Commission des Titres d'Ing\u00e9nieur]].''\n\nFrance is particular in that it is mainly the ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur'', which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (''universit\u00e9s''). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, ''grandes \u00e9coles'' in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with more selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide).\n\n=== Germany and Austria ===\n\nIn [[German language|German]], the traditional engineer's degree is called ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' (''Dipl.-Ing.'', in Austria ''DI'' is  also used). This supersedes \"Ing. (Grad)\", the old form in Germany. This degree is generally equivalent to a [[Master's degree]], which is not to be confused with the old ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' degree. Most programs that used to lead to a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' degree lead to master's degrees today, as the ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' as an academic title is phased out because of the [[Bologna Process]]. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' with the newly introduced M.Sc. degrees.\n\nThe German \"Universities of Applied Sciences\" (''[[Fachhochschule]]'') award the traditional engineering degree ''Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)'' (''Dipl.-Ing. (FH)''). A requirement for the degree is to write a ''[[Diplom]]'' [[thesis]]. This is also being modified by the [[Bologna Process]], as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a ''traditional'' university.<ref>Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 07.02.2008)</ref>\nUniversities of Applied Sciences were phased out and, despite some retaining the term \"Applied Sciences\", have been reorganized into universities with their own faculties and research institutes. These universities are often strongly focused on fields such as computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a ''Staatsexamen'' (state exam) can only be studied at ''traditional'' universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.\n\nIn Austria there also exists the ''Ingenieur'' (respectively ''Ing.''). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called ''HTL'' (''H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt'') which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title ''Ingenieur (Ing.)'' could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education.\n\nWith a revision of the Austrian engineer's law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017<ref>Ingenieurgesetz 2017 [https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2017_I_23 BGBl. I Nr. 23/2017]</ref>) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and verifiable practical experience of three years, the applicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the [[National Qualifications Framework]] on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria.\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn Greece, the title of \"Engineer\" is awarded by [[List of universities in Greece|Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)]]. There are two types of engineer. The title \"Diplomate Engineer\" (Diplomate in Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; K\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2/\u0394\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1/Diploma; Diploma holder) is awarded after completion at a [[Polytechnic (Greece)|Polytechnic]] University with five-year undergraduate engineering degree (diploma) programme (300 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]], [[ISCED]] 7), equivalent to an integrated [[Master's degree]], also has the title of \"Graduate Engineer\".\nThe title of \"Graduate Engineer\" is awarded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fme.aegean.gr/sites/default/files/docs/2017/fek114.pdf|title=Government's Gazette. Law 4485/2017 \u03a6\u0395\u039a \u0391 114 / Article 46 |publisher=}}</ref> after completion at a TEI University's undergraduate engineering degree programme (240 ECTS, ISCED 6) equivalent to a [[Bachelor's degree]]. The TEI Universities ([[List of universities in Greece#Technological educational institutes|Technological Educational Institute]] - TEI) it is also known as  [[Institute of technology|Institute of Technology]], University of Technology, University of Applied Sciences.\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn [[Italy]] until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year ''diploma in ingegneria'' (BEng level, title abbrev. \"dipl. ing.\") and a five-year ''laurea in ingegneria'' (MEng level, title abbrev. \"ing.\"). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called ''laurea'' (abbrev. \"L\") and master's degree level is called ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (abbrev. \"LS\"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea in ingegneria'' (BEng level) and the title of ''dottore in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea magistrale in ingegneria'' (MEng level) and the title of ''dottore magistrale in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After a \"state exam\" one becomes \"Ingegnere\" (abbrev. Ing). In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law. See regulations (in Italian) [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm0804l.htm DM 4 Agosto 2000] for \"laurea\" (bachelor) and [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm001128.htm DM 28 Novembre 2000] for \"laurea specialistica\" (BEng (Hon)-master). Chartered professions (including engineering) are regulated by state law 328/01 [http://www.miur.it/regolame/2001/professioniregolam/AgrArch/DPR328_2001.htm (\"D.P.R. 5 giugno 2001, n. 328\")].\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the [[Netherlands]], somebody holding an engineer's degree is an ''ingenieur''. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:\n* ''ir.'' is obtained by university graduates (''Wetenschappelijk onderwijs'' or WO).

There is not an academic degree of ''engenheiro'', despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET.\n\nUntil the [[Bologna Process]], having a ''licenciado'' (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' (3 years) degree or a ''mestre'' (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna ''licenciado'' or a ''mestre'' are classified as E2 grade engineers.\n\n=== Romania and Republic of Moldova ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[Romania]] and [[Republic of Moldova]] followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called ''Diploma de inginer'' and the graduate was called a ''Inginer diplomat''. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master (M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (''examen de diploma''). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called ''Diploma de Sub-inginer'' which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the [[Bologna process]], the graduates obtain the ''Inginer licentiat'' degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the ''Inginer Master'' degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe situation in [[Spain]] is very similar to France but without the ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the ''Proyecto de Fin de Carrera'' (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) or other degree called ''Ingeniero T\u00e9cnico'' (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field; however, certain engineering professions require by law a master's degree in their respective field, a degree called \"master habilitante\" or \"habilitating master's degree\".<ref>[https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2008/11/08/1837, \"Real Decreto 1837/2008, de 8 de noviembre, por el que se incorporan al ordenamiento jur\u00eddico espa\u00f1ol la Directiva 2005/36/CE, del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo, de 7 de septiembre de 2005, y la Directiva 2006/100/CE, del Consejo, de 20 de noviembre de 2006, relativas al reconocimiento de cualificaciones profesionales, as\u00ed como a determinados aspectos del ejercicio de la profesi\u00f3n de abogado.\"]</ref>  A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.<ref>[http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf \"National systems of engineering education, QA and accreditation\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180815/http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, TREE \u2013 Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThere are two different engineering degrees that belong to the so called professional degrees: ''civilingenj\u00f6r'' (Master of Science in Engineering), which requires five years of study and ''h\u00f6gskoleingenj\u00f6r'' (Bachelor of Science in Engineering), which amounts to three years. Both programmes admit students directly from secondary education.<ref name=\"ukae_qual\">{{cite web |title=Qualifications |url=https://english.uka.se/facts-about-higher-education/higher-education-in-sweden/qualifications.html |website=Swedish Higher Education Authority |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification, which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering, is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer to the MEng.\n\nThe [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] have established a recognised route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng.\nUK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline.  For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE and IET awards CEng, MIET.\n\nEngineers who have been awarded a BEng (Ordinary) or BEng (Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5]\n\nUniquely the Institution of Structural Engineers requires candidates for chartered status to undertake both a professional review interview and a seven-hour written examination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.istructe.org/training-and-development/membership-exams/chartered-membership-exam/|title=Chartered Membership exam - The Institution of Structural Engineers|date=2019-05-21|website=www.istructe.org|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The examination tests the candidates' ability to demonstrate:-\n\n* An understanding of structural engineering principles\n* An ability to initiate and communicate structural design\n* An ability to provide effective and viable solutions to a structural design problem\n\nChartered Engineer and [[Incorporated Engineer]] titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles\u2014like the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK.\n\nMIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC.\n\nThis meaning retains the 19th century idea that \"real\" engineers were military personnel, while \"other\" engineers were civilians.\n\n== Europe (according to the Bologna Process) ==\n{{main|Bologna process}}\n\nFollowing the introduction of the [[Bologna process]], universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year [[bachelor's degree]], a one to two-year [[master's degree]] and a [[doctoral degree]]. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the [[bachelor's degree]] (''baccalaureus'', three to four years) and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a [[master's degree]] (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).  But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.<ref>{{cite report|author=European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice|date= 2015|title=The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report|publisher= Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:The_European_Higher_Education_Area_in_2015:_Bologna_Process_Implementation_Report|pages=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\nMost traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year ''Civilingenj\u00f6r'' in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the ''civilingenj\u00f6r'' degree.<ref name=\"ukae_qual\">{{cite web |title=Qualifications |url=https://english.uka.se/facts-about-higher-education/higher-education-in-sweden/qualifications.html |website=Swedish Higher Education Authority |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn France, an important part of engineering is taught in ''\u00e9coles d\u2019ing\u00e9nieurs'', which are part of the French ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' system.

In the past, it was not uncommon for a would-be engineer to earn an engineering degree as their first and only college degree. But since [[World War II]] this has fallen out of favor and it becomes continually more difficult to find a school that offers this option.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nA degree with some form of the word ''engineer'' or ''engineering'' in the title is not necessarily an engineer's degree. Particularly, a \"[[Master of Engineering]]\" (M.Eng.) or \"[[Bachelor of Engineering]]\" (B.Eng.) degree is ''not'' an Engineer's degree, nor is any other bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree. Rather, the engineer's degree is in a category of its own. For example, a student with a B.S. and M.S. in [[electrical engineering]] might next earn the degree ''Electrical Engineer''. The person would then have a B.S. in E.E., a M.S. in E.E. and an E.E. degree. The former two are degrees in engineering and only the latter degree is actually an engineer's degree.\n\n== Latin America ==\nIn [[Latin America]], a degree or title of \"Ingeniero\" is awarded after completing five years of college.  This may be translated as \"Engineer\", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state [[licence]] to legally practice in the field or a professional certification outside the academic environment.\n\n=== Chile ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''T\u00edtulo Profesional'' (professional title), ''Mag\u00edster'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate or Ph.D).\n\nIn this case, the ''engineer'' status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (T\u00edtulo Profesional en Ingenier\u00eda). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study.\n\nAs in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a [[doctoral degree]]. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree.\n\n=== Mexico ===\n{{see also|Licentiate (degree)#Mexico}}\nIn [[Mexico]], the educational system follows closely that of the [[United States]]. University education is structured in three cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Maestr\u00eda'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate).\n\nThe ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'') that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'') in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceead.org.mx/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=137818|title=Ley del Ejercicio Profesional|last=LA H. XLIX LEGISLATURA DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor engineering, completing all taught courses of a ''Licenciatura'' does not automatically award the graduate the title and [[licence]] of ''Ingeniero''; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix ''Ingenier\u00eda'' attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the [[diploma]] and title of Engineer and the professional credential, after getting their professional [[credential]] (''c\u00e9dula profesional'').\n\nDegrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a [[master's degree]] or in exceptional cases, directly into a [[doctoral degree]].\n\n== Europe (prior to the Bologna Process) ==\nPrior to the [[Bologna Process]], In most countries of [[continental Europe]], universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing [[secondary education]] and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a [[doctorate]].\n\nFollowing German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplom]]''. In addition to [[Germany]] itself, this system was common in states like [[Albania]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\n=== Belgium ===\nIn Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees:\n\n* \"Burgerlijk Ingenieur\" / \"Ing\u00e9nieur civil\" or \"Master of Science in Engineering\" (abbrev. \"ir.\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by [[List of universities in Belgium|universities]].\n* \"Bio-ingenieur\" / \"Bioing\u00e9nieur\" or \"Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering\" (abbrev. \"ir.\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by universities.\n* \"Industrieel Ingenieur\" / \"Ing\u00e9nieur industriel\" or \"Master of Science in Industrial Engineering\" (abbrev. \"Ing.\") - five years study in [[French Community of Belgium]] (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.) or four years of study in the [[Flemish Community of Belgium]] (3 BSc. + 1 MSc.), delivered by universities.\n\nNames are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by law.\nBelgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== Belarus and Ukraine ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], the degree is ''\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u0456\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440'' (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study.\n\n=== Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Ex-Yugoslavia ===\nIn [[Croatia]], the old system included the engineer's degrees ''diplomirani in\u017eenjer'' (abbr. ''dipl.ing.'') which was awarded by university faculties and a lower ranked engineer's degree ''in\u017eenjer'' (abbr. ''ing.'') which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the [[Netherlands]]. The old ''dipl.ing.'' degree could later be upgraded to a ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr.'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and then a ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr.'', [[Doctorate]]). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the abbreviation is ''dipl.in\u017e''.<ref>Ivan Klajn, Re\u010dnik jezi\u010dkih nedoumica (NOLIT, Beograd)</ref> Serbian titles of ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr'', [[Doctorate]]) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.\n\n=== Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called ''in\u017cynier'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), ''in\u017einier'' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) or ''in\u017een\u00fdr'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]) and the abbreviation is ''in\u017c.'' in [[Poland]] and ''Ing.'' in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], which may be written before the person's name.\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the degree of ''Ing.'' is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]''.\n\nIn [[Poland]], the degree of ''in\u017cynier'' is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the ''[[licencjat]]'' in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A ''magister in\u017cynier'' (abbreviated ''mgr in\u017c.'') refers to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]'', after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were \"in\u017cynier\" studies that lasted for four years and afterward one could obtain the \"magister\" title in two years of studies\u2014the total of six years resulted in two degrees, \"magister\" and \"in\u017cynier\". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the \"magister in\u017cynier\" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the \"magister in\u017cynier\" (mgr in\u017c. before the name) was the equivalent degree with \"in\u017cynier\" designating the professional level and \"magister\" designating the academic level.\nAfter the [[Bologna process]] the first level is \"in\u017cynier,\" obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before and \"masters\" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that \"magister in\u017cynier\" be made a basis for professional rights.\n\n=== Finland ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[diplomi-insin\u00f6\u00f6ri]]'' and abbreviated ''dipl.ins.'', ''DI'' or ''M.Sc.(Tech.)''. It is possible to obtain after five years of studying or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' (''B.Sc.(Tech.)'') degree.\n\nThe degree of ''[[insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (AMK)]]'' is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]''), similar to a German ''[[Fachhochschule]]'', but it is not interchangeable with the academic ''tekniikan kandidaatti''.\n\nDue to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called ''insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (ylempi AMK)'' or \"engineer (higher amk)\" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of ''insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (AMK)'' and further studies.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n\n\nIn France, there are two main ways to become an engineer:\n\n* Have a ''[[Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur|Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur]]'', delivered by the French [[Grandes \u00c9coles|''grandes \u00e9coles'']] in engineering.\n* Have a Master's degree in Science, delivered by public [[List of public universities in France|universities]].\n\nThe ''[[Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur|Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur]]'' is a postgraduate degree in engineering usually awarded by the French [[Grandes \u00c9coles|''grandes \u00e9coles'']] in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French ''[[Baccalaur\u00e9at]].''\n\nEach holder of the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'' is conferred the title of ''Ing\u00e9nieur dipl\u00f4m\u00e9'' (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term ''ing\u00e9nieur'' (engineer) which is less-regulated. The ''dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'' is recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States and in the countries of the European Union (also in France).\n\nMost ''grande \u00e9cole'' give the opportunity to their students to join a double degree with a University (in France or abroad). Furthermore, ''Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'' graduates can pursue a selective PhD after their engineering studies to later join academia or an industrial R&D department.\n\nAny institution issuing the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'' must be accredited by the ''[[Commission des titres d'ing\u00e9nieur]].''\n\nFrance is particular in that it is mainly the [[Grandes \u00e9coles|''grandes \u00e9coles'']] in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur'', which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (''Universit\u00e9s''). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, ''grandes \u00e9coles'' in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with more selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide).\n\n=== Germany and Austria ===\n\nIn [[German language|German]], the traditional engineer's degree is called ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' (''Dipl.-Ing.'', in Austria ''DI'' is  also used). This supersedes \"Ing. (Grad)\", the old form in Germany. This degree is generally equivalent to a [[Master's degree]], which is not to be confused with the old ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' degree. Most programs that used to lead to a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' degree lead to master's degrees today, as the ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' as an academic title is phased out because of the [[Bologna Process]]. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' with the newly introduced M.Sc. degrees.\n\nThe German \"Universities of Applied Sciences\" (''[[Fachhochschule]]'') award the traditional engineering degree ''Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)'' (''Dipl.-Ing. (FH)''). A requirement for the degree is to write a ''[[Diplom]]'' [[thesis]]. This is also being modified by the [[Bologna Process]], as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a ''traditional'' university.<ref>Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 07.02.2008)</ref>\nUniversities of Applied Sciences were phased out and, despite some retaining the term \"Applied Sciences\", have been reorganized into universities with their own faculties and research institutes. These universities are often strongly focused on fields such as computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a ''Staatsexamen'' (state exam) can only be studied at ''traditional'' universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.\n\nIn Austria there also exists the ''Ingenieur'' (respectively ''Ing.''). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called ''HTL'' (''H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt'') which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title ''Ingenieur (Ing.)'' could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education.\n\nWith a revision of the Austrian engineer's law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017<ref>Ingenieurgesetz 2017 [https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2017_I_23 BGBl. I Nr. 23/2017]</ref>) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and verifiable practical experience of three years, the applicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the [[National Qualifications Framework]] on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria.\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn Greece, the title of \"Engineer\" is awarded by [[List of universities in Greece|Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)]]. There are two types of engineer. The title \"Diplomate Engineer\" (Diplomate in Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; K\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2/\u0394\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1/Diploma; Diploma holder) is awarded after completion at a [[Polytechnic (Greece)|Polytechnic]] University with five-year undergraduate engineering degree (diploma) programme (300 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]], [[ISCED]] 7), equivalent to an integrated [[Master's degree]], also has the title of \"Graduate Engineer\".\nThe title of \"Graduate Engineer\" is awarded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fme.aegean.gr/sites/default/files/docs/2017/fek114.pdf|title=Government's Gazette. Law 4485/2017 \u03a6\u0395\u039a \u0391 114 / Article 46 |publisher=}}</ref> after completion at a TEI University's undergraduate engineering degree programme (240 ECTS, ISCED 6) equivalent to a [[Bachelor's degree]]. The TEI Universities ([[List of universities in Greece#Technological educational institutes|Technological Educational Institute]] - TEI) it is also known as  [[Institute of technology|Institute of Technology]], University of Technology, University of Applied Sciences.\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn [[Italy]] until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year ''diploma in ingegneria'' (BEng level, title abbrev. \"dipl. ing.\") and a five-year ''laurea in ingegneria'' (MEng level, title abbrev. \"ing.\"). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called ''laurea'' (abbrev. \"L\") and master's degree level is called ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (abbrev. \"LS\"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea in ingegneria'' (BEng level) and the title of ''dottore in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea magistrale in ingegneria'' (MEng level) and the title of ''dottore magistrale in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After a \"state exam\" one becomes \"Ingegnere\" (abbrev. Ing). In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law. See regulations (in Italian) [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm0804l.htm DM 4 Agosto 2000] for \"laurea\" (bachelor) and [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm001128.htm DM 28 Novembre 2000] for \"laurea specialistica\" (BEng (Hon)-master). Chartered professions (including engineering) are regulated by state law 328/01 [http://www.miur.it/regolame/2001/professioniregolam/AgrArch/DPR328_2001.htm (\"D.P.R. 5 giugno 2001, n. 328\")].\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the [[Netherlands]], somebody holding an engineer's degree is an ''ingenieur''. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:\n* ''ir.'' is obtained by university graduates (''Wetenschappelijk onderwijs'' or WO). It is the highest engineer qualification. - five years study (3 B.Sc. + 2 M.Sc.)\n* ''ing.'' is obtained by graduates from polytechnics (''hoger beroeps onderwijs'' or HBO). - four years study (4 B.Eng. or B.ASc.)\n\nNames are traditionally prefixed with the ''ir.'' or ''ing.'' titles. Use of these titles is regulated and protected by Dutch law.<ref>[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_07-05-2013 \"Artikel 435 lid 3 Wetboek van strafrecht\"] (in Dutch)</ref> Under the Bologna agreement, the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc., BBE, M.Sc., etc.).\n\nCompletion of Dutch engineering qualifications has historically demanded a lot of effort. On average the five-year course takes seven years to finish.<ref>[http://www.studenten.net/studieleven/nieuws/17783/uitwonende_studenten_doen_langer_over_studie \"Opleidingen met een zogenoemd 'zwaar wiskundig profiel' als Bouwkunde, Econometrie en Elektrotechniek zorgen voor de meeste vertraging bij wo-studenten\"] (in Dutch)</ref><ref>[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/onderwijs/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2010/2010-3078-wm.htm \"Vooral bij techniek, industrie en bouwkunde is de wo-studieduur veel langer\"] (in Dutch)</ref>\n\n=== Portugal ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn Portugal, Engineer ({{lang-pt|engenheiro}}, feminine: ''engenheira'', abrev.: ''eng.'') is a professional degree reserved for the effective members of the [[Ordem dos Engenheiros|Portuguese Institution of the Engineers (OE, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros'')]] and Portuguese Institution of Technical Engineers (OET, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros T\u00e9cnicos''). There is not an academic degree of ''engenheiro'', despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET.\n\nUntil the [[Bologna Process]], having a ''licenciado'' (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' (3 years) degree or a ''mestre'' (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna ''licenciado'' or a ''mestre'' are classified as E2 grade engineers.\n\n=== Romania and Republic of Moldova ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[Romania]] and [[Republic of Moldova]] followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called ''Diploma de inginer'' and the graduate was called a ''Inginer diplomat''. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master (M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (''examen de diploma''). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called ''Diploma de Sub-inginer'' which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the [[Bologna process]], the graduates obtain the ''Inginer licentiat'' degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the ''Inginer Master'' degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe situation in [[Spain]] is very similar to France but without the ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the ''Proyecto de Fin de Carrera'' (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) or other degree called ''Ingeniero T\u00e9cnico'' (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field; however, certain engineering professions require by law a master's degree in their respective field, a degree called \"master habilitante\" or \"habilitating master's degree\".<ref>[https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2008/11/08/1837, \"Real Decreto 1837/2008, de 8 de noviembre, por el que se incorporan al ordenamiento jur\u00eddico espa\u00f1ol la Directiva 2005/36/CE, del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo, de 7 de septiembre de 2005, y la Directiva 2006/100/CE, del Consejo, de 20 de noviembre de 2006, relativas al reconocimiento de cualificaciones profesionales, as\u00ed como a determinados aspectos del ejercicio de la profesi\u00f3n de abogado.\"]</ref>  A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.<ref>[http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf \"National systems of engineering education, QA and accreditation\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180815/http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, TREE \u2013 Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThere are two different engineering degrees that belong to the so called professional degrees: ''civilingenj\u00f6r'' (Master of Science in Engineering), which requires five years of study and ''h\u00f6gskoleingenj\u00f6r'' (Bachelor of Science in Engineering), which amounts to three years. Both programmes admit students directly from secondary education.<ref name=\"ukae_qual\">{{cite web |title=Qualifications |url=https://english.uka.se/facts-about-higher-education/higher-education-in-sweden/qualifications.html |website=Swedish Higher Education Authority |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification, which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering, is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer to the MEng.\n\nThe [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] have established a recognised route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng.\nUK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline.  For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE and IET awards CEng, MIET.\n\nEngineers who have been awarded a BEng (Ordinary) or BEng (Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5]\n\nUniquely the Institution of Structural Engineers requires candidates for chartered status to undertake both a professional review interview and a seven-hour written examination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.istructe.org/training-and-development/membership-exams/chartered-membership-exam/|title=Chartered Membership exam - The Institution of Structural Engineers|date=2019-05-21|website=www.istructe.org|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The examination tests the candidates' ability to demonstrate:-\n\n* An understanding of structural engineering principles\n* An ability to initiate and communicate structural design\n* An ability to provide effective and viable solutions to a structural design problem\n\nChartered Engineer and [[Incorporated Engineer]] titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles\u2014like the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK.\n\nMIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC.\n\nThis meaning retains the 19th century idea that \"real\" engineers were military personnel, while \"other\" engineers were civilians.\n\n== Europe (according to the Bologna Process) ==\n{{main|Bologna process}}\n\nFollowing the introduction of the [[Bologna process]], universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year [[bachelor's degree]], a one to two-year [[master's degree]] and a [[doctoral degree]]. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the [[bachelor's degree]] (''baccalaureus'', three to four years) and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a [[master's degree]] (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).  But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.<ref>{{cite report|author=European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice|date= 2015|title=The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report|publisher= Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:The_European_Higher_Education_Area_in_2015:_Bologna_Process_Implementation_Report|pages=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\nMost traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year ''Civilingenj\u00f6r'' in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the ''civilingenj\u00f6r'' degree.<ref name=\"ukae_qual\">{{cite web |title=Qualifications |url=https://english.uka.se/facts-about-higher-education/higher-education-in-sweden/qualifications.html |website=Swedish Higher Education Authority |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn France, an important part of engineering is taught in ''\u00e9coles d\u2019ing\u00e9nieurs'', which are part of the French ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]]'' system. Since the [[Bologna Process]], the ''Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur'' is officially considered to be at the level of a master's degree.\n\nNotably, Europe has the international professional engineering qualification and title of [[European Engineer]] (EUR ING) which is obtained through peer review after seven years of education, training and professional experience.\n\n== Russia ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nAs of 2012 in [[Russia]], following degrees correspond to the \"engineer's degree\" in the sense of this article:\n* '''\u0418\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440''' - \"engineer\", which was formerly awarded after four, five, six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as \"mining engineer\" or \"systems engineer\".\n* '''\u0418\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438''' - \"engineer at specialty\" (where specialty's name is mentioned), currently awarded after five or six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as \"engineer-ecologist at specialty Rational usage of natural resources and protection of the environment\"\n* '''\u0418\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440-\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438''' - \"engineer-researcher at specialty\" (where specialty's name is mentioned), was formerly awarded after seven years of study\n* '''\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e''' - \"bachelor at area\" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after four years of study and \"area\" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former \"specialties\"\n* '''\u041c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e''' - \"magister (master) at area\" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after two years of study to those already having any higher-education degree and \"area\" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former \"specialties\"\nAnything but \"bachelor\" is considered \"second-level\" higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for \"candidate of sciences\" degree, \"bachelor\" is considered \"first-level\" higher education degree and gives access to study for master's (magister) degree.\n\nPost-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include '''\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a''' - \"candidate of technical sciences\" and '''\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a''' - \"doctor of technical sciences\".

Owner of a valid degree which is given by an engineering faculty at Turkish universities, can be called ''M\u00fchendis'', meaning \"Engineers\". The ''\"M\u00fchendis\"'' title is limited by law to people with a valid engineering degree and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal.

Likewise, a master's degree is referred to as Master of Engineering (M.Engg.) and Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.). At the undergraduate level, the course takes four years, only except being in the case of Urban and Regional Planning discipline, where it usually takes five years. In postgraduate education, pursuing a master's degree in any engineering discipline usually takes one to one and a half years. Graduated engineers who are members of either [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]] (IEB) or [[Institution of Textile Engineers and Technologists]] (ITET) are legally and formally allowed to use the title \"Engr.\" before their names.\n\n=== India ===\nThe engineering courses in India are regulated and set up under the aegis of the [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and [[National Board of Accreditation]] (NBA).\n\nIn India, engineering qualifications include the following:\n* '''Bachelor's degrees''' (four years after class 12 and three years after [[Diploma in Engineering]]): BE ([[Bachelor of Engineering]]) and BTech ([[Bachelor of Technology]]). Both are same. Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination.\n* '''Master's degrees''' (two or more years after BE and BTech): ME ([[Master of Engineering]]), MTech ([[Master of Technology]]) and MSc (Eng) ([[Master of Science in Engineering]]). Admission usually requires qualification in the [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] or some work experience in an engineering field. The MTech and ME degrees are same and of two years' duration. MTech/ME usually has coursework in the first year and a project in the second year. The MSc (Eng) degree is usually research oriented and may requires two or more years to complete.\n* '''Doctoral degrees''' (three to five years): PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Admission requirements vary across universities but usually include a master's degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in engineering with an exceptionally good academic record.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nIn Pakistan, engineering qualifications include the following:\n\n* '''BE (Bachelor of Engineering)''' or '''BS/BSc Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering)''' - four years' duration.\n* '''ME (Master of Engineering)''' or '''MS/MSc Engineering (Master of Science in Engineering)''' - 1.5 to 2 years' duration.\n* '''PhD (Engineering)''' - minimum three years' duration.\n\n[[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession. PEC is a full signatory of [[Washington Accord]]<ref>http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/</ref> and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).<ref>http://www.ieagreements.org/agreements/ipea/members/</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nIn [[Vietnam]], the engineer's degree is called ''B\u1eb1ng k\u1ef9 s\u01b0'', the first degree after five years of study. The Ministry of Education of Vietnam has also issued separate regulations for the naming of degrees not in accordance with international regulation. The Engineer's degree is named \"[[The Degree of Engineer]]\" in the degree (e.g. ''The Degree of Engineer in Information Technology''). The degree of engineer is ranked at the same academic level as a bachelor's degree.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Institute of technology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=profession.regProfs&profId=6000 Database of regulated professions in the EU.]\n* [http://www.europestudycentre.com/ Top Engineering Universities and Colleges in Europe]\n\n{{Academic degrees}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Engineer's Degree}}\n[[Category:Academic degrees]]\n[[Category:Engineering education|Degrees]]\n[[Category:Academic degrees of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Robminchin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_degree"}
