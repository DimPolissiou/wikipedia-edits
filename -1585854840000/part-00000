It has been serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine since July 22, 1997, and has been collected into 95 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story follows the adventures of [[Monkey D. Luffy]], a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the [[Straw Hat Pirates]], Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as \"One Piece\" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.\n\nThe manga spawned a [[media franchise]], having been adapted into a festival film produced by [[Production I.G]], and an [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]], which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one [[original video animation]] and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and [[List of One Piece video games|numerous video games]]. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by [[Viz Media]] and in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The anime series was licensed by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by [[Funimation]] in 2007.\n\n''One Piece'' has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. The official website for Eiichiro Oda's ''One Piece'' manga announced that the manga has set the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]'' for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". {{as of|2020|02}}, the manga had over 462 million copies in circulation in 43 countries worldwide, making it the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history. It became the best-selling manga for the eleventh consecutive year in 2018.

Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship.

In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way.

The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship.

It has been serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine since July 22, 1997, and has been collected into 95 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story follows the adventures of [[Monkey D. Luffy]], a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the [[Straw Hat Pirates]], Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as \"One Piece\" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.\n\nThe manga spawned a [[media franchise]], having been adapted into a festival film produced by [[Production I.G]], and an [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]], which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one [[original video animation]] and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and [[List of One Piece video games|numerous video games]]. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by [[Viz Media]] and in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The anime series was licensed by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by [[Funimation]] in 2007.\n\n''One Piece'' has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. The official website for Eiichiro Oda's ''One Piece'' manga announced that the manga has set the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]'' for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". {{as of|2020|02}}, the manga had over 462 million copies in circulation in 43 countries worldwide, making it the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history.

Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship.

In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way.

The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship.

(He renamed it as the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in 1903.)\n\nBy the late 1890s, Zion headquarters had moved to the seven-story Zion Home on Michigan Avenue. This building also housed many worshippers in residence from all walks of life; nearby were the New Zion Tabernacle, Zion Junior School, Zion College, Zion Printing, and the Zion Hall of Seventies. Dowie also established the Zion Home of Hope, more Zion Tabernacles, and various healing homes in Chicago. He leased Chicago's [[Auditorium Building]] to accommodate the swelling crowds attending his services.

In 1900, he announced the founding of the city of Zion, 40 miles from Chicago: he personally owned all the property. He established a [[theocracy|theocratic]] political and economic structure and prohibited smoking, drinking, eating pork, and the practice of any form of modern medicine. He also established a range of businesses, healing homes, and a large Tabernacle. Followers from across the world descended on Zion.

Although Dowie funded his lifestyle largely through tithes, he also liked to buy up securities of [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] companies and sell them off to his members.<ref> ''London Daily Mail'', 24 October 1900; I. D. Bowman, \"Dowieism Exposed,\" (Philadelphia: 1904),  10-1.</ref> Two women whom he had defrauded in this way sued him and won their cases. \n\nIn the aftermath of this legal and public relations defeat, Dowie moved to Chicago in 1890. After a few unsuccessful years in Chicago, he gained fame by renting property adjacent to the [[Chicago World's Fair|World's Fair]] in 1893. There he staged elaborate \"Divine Healings\" in front of large audiences drawn from attendees to the fair. Many of these \"healings\" were staged: Dowie used audience plants and other dubious methods. At other times he arranged for carefully screened individuals to be brought on stage to be healed.<ref>R.

(He renamed it as the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in 1903.)\n\nBy the late 1890s, Zion headquarters had moved to the seven-story Zion Home on Michigan Avenue. This building also housed many worshippers in residence from all walks of life; nearby were the New Zion Tabernacle, Zion Junior School, Zion College, Zion Printing, and the Zion Hall of Seventies. Dowie also established the Zion Home of Hope, more Zion Tabernacles, and various healing homes in Chicago. He leased Chicago's [[Auditorium Building]] to accommodate the swelling crowds attending his services. Beyond Chicago, his teaching spread through evangelists and publications across the U.S. and around the world.<ref name=\"FaithCity\"/><ref name=FL1899StoryZion >Zion, General Overseer, [http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/leaves_of_healing/leaves_of_healing_v6_1899_oct-1900_apr.pdf#page=493 \"The Story of Zion\"], ''Fallen Leaf,'' 10 Feb 1900, Vol.VI, No.16, p. 482</ref> As his following expanded, Dowie also faced considerable criticism.

In 1900, he announced the founding of the city of Zion, 40 miles from Chicago: he personally owned all the property. He established a [[theocracy|theocratic]] political and economic structure and prohibited smoking, drinking, eating pork, and the practice of any form of modern medicine. He also established a range of businesses, healing homes, and a large Tabernacle. Followers from across the world descended on Zion. Zion has been characterized as \"a carefully-devised large-scale platform for securities fraud requiring significant organizational, legal, and propagandistic preparation to carry out.\"<ref>B.

It appeared to be a registered entity but was, in fact, an unincorporated entity under his control. He also sold worthless stock in an array of Zion's businesses.<ref>\u201cHolmes vs Dowie et al,\u201d ''Federal Reporter'' 138 (1906-7); \u201cSamuel Stevenson vs John Alexander Dowie (January 31, 1902).\u201d In ''Illinois Circuit Court Reports,'' 3.

O'Connor]], an Irish M.P. and journalist, wrote of Dowie: \n<blockquote>\"the one incomprehensible element in the man's gigantic success is the personal luxury in which he lives, and his superb refusal at the same time to account for any of the sums of money entrusted to him. His horses are worth a fortune in themselves; his carriages are emblazoned with armorial bearings; his wife is said to dress with the gorgeous extravagance of an empress. When he travels, hemmed round with a little army of servants, the prophet of humility and self-denial has a special train chartered, and whenever the spiritual burdens become too great a tax there is a delightful country residence belonging to him in which to retreat from the clamour and importunate appeals of the faithful.<ref>[https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-659229080/view?sectionId=nla.obj-664172503 Personal Items, ''The Bulletin'' (Australia), 27 August 1903, p16], National Library of Australia</ref></blockquote>\n\nBecause of his questionable practices, his wife and children left him.

However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed. The Dee Dees arrive again at 3:00 to see Dexter righting something and warn him, he then firmly says that they're interrupting his \"...very important calculations.\" as it shows Dexter's papers for the doorway.<ref>{{cite episode |title=DeeDeemensional |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Dexter's Laboratory |series-link= |first=Rob |last=Renzetti |network=TNT |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=english}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIMDb: {{Rating|7.6|10}} Rating Graph: {{Rating|7.6|10}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title          = DeeDeemensional\n| series         = [[Dexter's Laboratory]]\n| image          = \n| image_size     = 220\n| alt            = Dexter looks up with his 3d glasses as his sister appears twice, on in blue and one in red, as the title of the episode shows below.\n| caption        = The [[intertitle]].\n| season         = 1\n| series_no      =\n| episode        = 1a\n| director       = \n* [[Rob Renzetti]] (director)\n* [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] (director)\n* [[Horseman Cao]] (animation director)\n* [[Chris Cuddington]] (animation director)\n* [[Bodie Chandler]] (music director)\n| writer         = Rob Renzetti\n| story          = \n| teleplay       = \n| based_on       = \n| narrator       = \n| presenter      =\n| producer       = \n* Genndy Tartakovsky (producer)\n* [[Lary Huber]] (executive producer))\n* [[Buzz Potamkin]] (executive producer)\n* [[Fred Seibert]] (executive producer)\n* [[Ted Turner]] (executive producer)\n* [[Davis Doi]] (supervising producer)\n* [[Debby Hindman]] (associative producer)\n* [[Bob Onorato]] (line producer)\n| music          = \n* Bodie Chandler (director)\n* [[Gary Lionelli]] (composer)\n* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (composer)\n* [[Pamela Phillips Oland]] (end lyrics)\n| photographer   = \n| editor         = \n* [[Pat Foley]] (supervising film editor)\n* [[Paul Douglas (editor)|Paul Douglas]] (supervising film editor) (supervising editor)\n* [[Tom Gleason]] (supervising editor)\n* [[Gina Lamar]] (post-production assistant)\n* [[John Forrest Niss]] (post-production executive)\n* [[William Deboer Jr.]] (negative cutter)\n| production     = 102a<ref>{{cite web |title=DeeDeemensional |url=https://dexterslab.fandom.com/wiki/DeeDeemensional |website=Dexter's Laboratory Wiki |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| airdate        = {{Start date|1996|04|27}}\n| length         = 7 minutes\n| awards         = \n| guests         = \n| prev           = \n| next           = [[Dial M for Monkey: Magmanamus]]\n| season_article = \n| episode_list   = [[List of Dexter's Laboratory episodes]]\n}}\n\"'''DeeDeemensional'''\" is the first of thre shorts of the first episode of the [[Cartoon Network|animated television series]] \"[[Dexter's Laboratory]]\".

On 18 June 2008, Budapest, Hungary was chosen by the EU nations to host the headquarters of the institute.\n\nThe Governing Board of the EIT met on 16 December 2008 in Budapest to designate the first three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).\n\n'''Sustainable energy - Co-location centres :'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eit.europa.eu/fileadmin/Content/Downloads/PDF/news_items/Summary_InnoEnergy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222225533/http://eit.europa.eu/fileadmin/Content/Downloads/PDF/news_items/Summary_InnoEnergy.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[Karlsruhe]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Grenoble]], [[Eindhoven]]/[[Leuven]], [[Barcelona]], [[Stockholm]]\n\n'''Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation - Co-location centres''':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eit.europa.eu/fileadmin/Content/Downloads/PDF/news_items/Summary_Climate-KIC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410173636/http://eit.europa.eu/fileadmin/Content/Downloads/PDF/news_items/Summary_Climate-KIC.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[London]], [[Zurich]], [[Berlin]] metropolitan area, [[Paris]] metropolitan area, [[Randstad]] metropolitan area\n\n'''Future information and communication society - Co-location centres''':<ref>http://eit.europa.eu/fileadmin/Content/Downloads/PDF/news_items/Summary_EIT_ICT_Labs.pdf</ref>\n[[Berlin]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Helsinki]], [[Paris]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Trento]]\n\n===Research organisations===\n* [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN)\n* [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]\n* [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL)\n*[[European Research Council]]\n* [[European Space Agency]] (ESA)\n* [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] (IRMM)\n* [[Institute for Transuranium Elements]](ITU)\n* [[Institute for the Protection and the Security of the Citizen]] (IPSC)\n* [[Institute for Environment and Sustainability]] (IES)\n* [[Institute for Health and Consumer Protection]] (IHCP)\n* [[Institute for Energy]] (IE)\n* [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies]] (IPTS)\n*[[Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute]] (M-ITI)\n\n==Scientific fields==\n\n===Physics===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Chemistry===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Biological and earth sciences===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Psychology===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Science}}\n* [[European Research Area]]\n* [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]]\n* [[Lisbon Strategy]]\n* [[Science and technology in Africa]]\n* [[Science and technology in Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/monitoring/statistical01_en.htm Key figures of science, technology and innovation]\n* [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-AE-07-001/EN/KS-AE-07-001-EN.PDF Science, technology and innovation in Europe]\n\n{{Europe topic|Science and technology in}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Science And Technology In Europe}}\n[[Category:Science and technology in Europe|*]]\n", "name_user": "Me, Myself, and I are Here", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eResearch organisations:space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_Europe"}
