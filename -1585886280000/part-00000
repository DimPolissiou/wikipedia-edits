It also drew attention to unlawful [[gambling]] and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of [[federal offense]] conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the [[NFL]], was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more. With other creditors also attempting to collect millions of dollars in debts, in July 2008, he filed for [[Chapter 11]] (reorganization) bankruptcy protection.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Michael-Vick Jets-vs-Eagles-Sept-3-2009 Post-Game-Interview (cropped).jpg|thumb|Michael Vick]]\nThe Bad News dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]], owned by [[Atlanta Falcons]]\u2019 football [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]], and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. Over 70 dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on [[federal offense]] and state [[felony]] charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as \"Bad News Kennels\", based upon a local nickname for [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Vick's hometown.{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies since 2007|date=February 2020}} Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes [[gambling]], and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, \"slamming\", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In consequence, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted.\n\nBy August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under [[plea bargain]] agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2974225 |title=Two more plea deals spell serious trouble for Vick |website=ESPN Sports |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPNPlea\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty|website=ESPN Sports |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who was not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nOn November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in [[federal prison]] respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which [[dog fighting]] was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding \"Dog fighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world.\" They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, \"suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs&nbsp;... get involved in this world\".\n\nJudge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dog fighting as normal behavior, that did not temper guilt in this case. As he pronounced a sentence which exceeded the guidelines and plea agreement recommendations, he stated: \"You may have thought this was sporting, but it was very callous and cruel&nbsp;...

There had already been talk that the government might seek a RICO indictment, based on the specific \"continuing criminal enterprise\" language in the original indictment and in Taylor's plea agreement. A key element of proving racketeering is the existence of a \"criminal enterprise\", and gambling is an indictable offense under RICO. RICO is relatively easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of criminal behavior. If Vick had been charged under RICO, he would have faced penalties of up to 20 years in prison and pay [[treble damages]].\n\n====Other co-defendants also to plead guilty; Vick weighs options====\nBy August 13, Vick's other two co-defendants, Peace and Phillips, had also agreed to also plead guilty under their own plea agreements, they were due in judge Hudson's court in consecutive hearings on August 17.<!--<ref>[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-03840sy0aug14,0,7380937.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> This ref has no archived copies.

Poindexter and Brown said they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities. Both Brown and Poindexter told news media that they were taken aback by the level of detail in the indictments, especially mention of dogs allegedly being executed by hanging, drowning and electrocution. \"That's revealing to me.

Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local case. [[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases.

Over 50 dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered, and a number of the interstate fight events, all with attendant gambling activities, were allegedly hosted at Vick's Surry County estate.\n\nOn August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told [[WVEC-TV]] that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were \"a road map to indictments in Surry County.\" <ref name=autogenerated8 /> The plea agreements implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs. It had been noted in earlier media reports that one of the agreements states that eight dogs were killed jointly by Peace, Phillips and Vick in April 2007 (prior to the April 25 search).\n\nPoindexter told the WVEC news reporter that he's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. \"We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome.\" he added.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> It was also not clear whether any state prison sentence(s) would be allowed run concurrently with any federal time, or would be served consecutively.

It also drew attention to unlawful [[gambling]] and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of [[federal offense]] conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the [[NFL]], was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more.

Over 70 dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on [[federal offense]] and state [[felony]] charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as \"Bad Newz Kennels\", based upon a local nickname for [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Vick's hometown.{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies since 2007|date=February 2020}} Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes [[gambling]], and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, \"slamming\", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In consequence, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted.\n\nBy August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under [[plea bargain]] agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2974225 |title=Two more plea deals spell serious trouble for Vick |website=ESPN Sports |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPNPlea\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty|website=ESPN Sports |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who was not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nOn November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in [[federal prison]] respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which [[dog fighting]] was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding \"Dogfighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world.\" They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, \"suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs&nbsp;... get involved in this world\".\n\nJudge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dogfighting as normal behavior, that did not temper guilt in this case. As he pronounced a sentence which exceeded the guidelines and plea agreement recommendations, he stated: \"You may have thought this was sporting, but it was very callous and cruel&nbsp;...

There had already been talk that the government might seek a RICO indictment, based on the specific \"continuing criminal enterprise\" language in the original indictment and in Taylor's plea agreement. A key element of proving racketeering is the existence of a \"criminal enterprise\", and gambling is an indictable offense under RICO. RICO is relatively easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of criminal behavior. If Vick had been charged under RICO, he would have faced penalties of up to 20 years in prison and pay [[treble damages]].\n\n====Other co-defendants also to plead guilty; Vick weighs options====\nBy August 13, Vick's other two co-defendants, Peace and Phillips, had also agreed to also plead guilty under their own plea agreements, they were due in judge Hudson's court in consecutive hearings on August 17.<!--<ref>[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-03840sy0aug14,0,7380937.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> This ref has no archived copies.

Poindexter and Brown said they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities. Both Brown and Poindexter told news media that they were taken aback by the level of detail in the indictments, especially mention of dogs allegedly being executed by hanging, drowning and electrocution. \"That's revealing to me.

Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local case. [[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases.

However, no individuals have been named as target(s) to date. Until August 17, there had also been no indication of how many charges might be presented to the grand jury in Surry County. Over 50 dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered, and a number of the interstate fight events, all with attendant gambling activities, were allegedly hosted at Vick's Surry County estate.\n\nOn August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told [[WVEC-TV]] that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were \"a road map to indictments in Surry County.\" <ref name=autogenerated8 /> The plea agreements implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs. It had been noted in earlier media reports that one of the agreements states that eight dogs were killed jointly by Peace, Phillips and Vick in April 2007 (prior to the April 25 search).\n\nPoindexter told the WVEC news reporter that he's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. \"We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome.\" he added.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> It was also not clear whether any state prison sentence(s) would be allowed run concurrently with any federal time, or would be served consecutively.

Nijkeuter'', Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek (pp. 18 & 42)</ref> was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] poet, playwright, radio personality, children's book writer and painter. Writing in [[Dr\u00e8ents]] (except for his [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-language children's books and some poems in Dutch), he was one of the earliest Dr\u00e8ents writers to express personal themes and is considered to have been \"the first true, modern Dr\u00e8ents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways\".<ref>''Heufdstuk 13.

He and his three sisters grew up in a poor family of ''gereformeerd'' ([[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands|reformed]]) creed. His father was a clogmaker and poached on the side to add to the family income; in his spare time he painted and drew. Reflected on his father's artistic activity, Hans noted that he \"painted small landscapes, very primitively, with brushes made of his own hair. When he'd been to the barber, he took tufts of hair with him. Ja! None of his work was kept.\"<ref>Hendrik Nijkeuter (2005), ''De dichter en de wichter: Verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting. Verzorgd en ingeleid door dr. H. Nijkeuter'', Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek (p. 18)</ref>\n\nWhen he was about ten, his father died; he and his sister found the body. From this point on, Heyting - who detested the suffocating atmosphere at the reformed school - became alienated from his surroundings. He remarked on his faith that he was taught: \"I felt God was spying on me all day long. At night I sensed an angel standing by the bed. I was terrified because I could feel the draught of his wings beating.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 18</ref> Around this time he met his later fellow Dr\u00e8ents poet, [[Roel Reijntjes]], who was also from Beilen.\n\nHeyting was expelled from [[vocational school]] in [[Hoogeveen]] for blowing up the bicycle shed with a homemade bomb. Various contacts outside his family caused the rift between him and his background to grow; later he would cut the ties completely. He worked as an electrician's apprentice and a paperboy for some time.\n\n==Work as a painter==\nBecause of a humpback - presumably caused by [[rickets]] - Heyting was unable to perform strenuous physical labour. He was trained as a painter at the studio of Louis Kortenhorst in Assen, painting mainly children's portraits. The journalist and religion teacher G.A. de Ridder, whose children he portrayed, introduced him to literature. Heyting's interest in art and literature grew when he met Hendrik Fernhout, an authority on literature who was being cared for at psychiatric institution Beileroord. Fernhout especially familiarized Heyting with the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]. Heyting's physician Meijering proved another influence on his intellectual development.\n\nHeyting made friends, and fell in love, with Ina Konings, a girl who was sixteen years younger and who lived next door to the Heytings. He painted and drew her and gave her a prominent place in his later poems and children's books. It was long thought that she died of tuberculosis at age thirteen and because of this, lived on as Heyting's muse. Heyting stated: \"She has become my inspiration. She always shows up in my work. (...) Because she died, she stayed alive for me.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30</ref> However, in 2005 Dr\u00e8ents scholar [[Henk Nijkeuter]] established that she was still alive and living abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hetdrentseboek.nl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18:heyting-hans-1918-1992&catid=14&Itemid=27 |title=Heyting, Hans (1918-1992) |publisher=Hetdrentseboek.nl |date=2010-12-24 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Life in Borger==\nIn 1944, during [[World War II]], Heyting went in hiding at a general practitioner's in the village of [[Borger (Drenthe)|Borger]]. He later said, \"At the end of the war, in 1944, I got in trouble with Fritz. I went about freely and that was no longer permitted. I was afraid I'd be arrested.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) pp. 19-20</ref> He briefly returned to Beilen just after the war, but memories of his reformed childhood drove him back to Borger, where he would stay for the rest of his life. He painted in the post-war years, joined the Drents Painters Society and wrote about painting in the periodicals ''Erica'', ''Drenthe'', and ''Nieuwe Drentsche Volksalmanak''.\n\nIn 1946, Heyting lived for a while with painter [[Anton Heyboer]], whose interest in Drenthe had been fanned by [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s letters to his brother Theo. In the same year, Heyting joined the painters' association De Drentse Schilders (which existed from 1946 to 1954) and exhibited his work in Assen and [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]]. Following the exhibitions, he got many commissions for portraiture, but he had a growing conviction that he lacked the requisite talent. About this he wrote in a poem, \"Is it pointless? Something fleeting, this laborious digging down? / Has everything he does not been done better?\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 24</ref> The Drentse Schilders collective disintegrated due to conflicts between members; at one point, Heyting and two of his colleagues had spent the association's funds on booze.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nThe portraits painted by Heyting are in various private collections. Many of his paintings were destroyed when the museum farm he was living in burnt down in 1967. The few extant still lifes show an affinity with the [[Magic Realism (painting)|Magic Realist]] style. After the fire, Heyting focussed more on writing, and \"gradually his work took on a literary dimension\".<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) pp. 120 & 125</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Heyting married Wilhelmina Carolina Hilverink ('Wil') from [[Hengelo]].\n\n==Radio work==\nHeyting became a stage director at the [[chamber of rhetoric|dramatic society]] of Borger. At private parties after performances, he often recited his work, played the [[lute]] and sung his own compositions. In 1950 he was seriously injured when jumping off the stage and was bedridden for almost a year. In 1951, he directed his own play ''De vr\u00f6mde v\u00f6gel'' (The oddball) about a painter who settles in a Drents village.\n\nHe became active as a writer and performer at Regionale Omroep Noord, the regional radio station, and got voice training from the station's director. He wrote Dr\u00e8ents texts for singers De Thrianta's and presented a fortnightly programme on art in Drenthe. Heyting performed in his own radio play ''Schuppen is troef'' and grew out to a popular radio presence in the province. His radio sketches feature village characters, their merits and especially their shortcomings. The Dr\u00e8ents-language programmes on regional radio strongly helped awaken people's interest in the regional language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediedrenthe.nl/RON |title=RON - Encyclopedie Drenthe Online |publisher=Encyclopediedrenthe.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> At age 62, Heyting quit radio work because it was becoming too much of a physical burden.\n\nAt the time of his radio work, Heyting was also employed at the library for the blind in [[Groningen]], for which he selected voices to record material.\n\n==Poetry==\nHeyting published four collections of his own poetry: ''Tweetalig'' (Bilingual, 1973, with poems in Dutch by Harm Werners), ''Spiegelschrift'' (Mirror writing, 1977), ''Toegift'' (Encore, 1983) and ''Dubbelfocus. Een cyclus gedichten'' (Bifocal. A poetry cycle, 1986). As to why he had only collected his poetry at a late stage, he declared, \"You see, I'm not the type to peddle my own work\".<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32</ref>\n\nIn the nineteen-fifties, Heyting was a member of the Drentse Schrieverskring, the Dr\u00e8ents writer's circle. His first poems were published by the Dr\u00e8ents-language monthly ''[[Oeze Volk]]'' which he helped found and of which he was a long-standing editor. In 1966-1967 he was the sole editor for a year, when the editorship was continued by writer [[Bart Veenstra]]. From 1980 on, Heyting published in the avant-garde Dr\u00e8ents literary magazine ''[[Roet (magazine)|Roet]]'', of which he was also an editor for a number of years.\n\nHeyting was initially influenced by traditional Dr\u00e8ents-language poets such as [[L.A. Roessingh]] and [[Jan Naarding]], writing anecdotal verse in archaic Dr\u00e8ents. Later, he was one of the first Dr\u00e8ents poets to distance himself from traditionalist poetry. Dr\u00e8ents poet [[Gerard Nijenhuis]] a friend of Heyting's, wrote about this change, \"Concepts are no longer described in detail, but only hinted at. (...) Moreover, the content becomes more 'condensed'.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30</ref>\n\n[[Marga Kool]], a fellow Dr\u00e8ents poet, discerns two main themes in Heyting's poems, \"the safe home as contrasted with the stupid, frightening outside world\" and \"the girl who has passed away\".<ref>Nijkeuter (2001), ''De \"pen gewijd aan Drenthe's dierbren grond\" : literaire bedrijvigheid in de Olde Lantschap, 1816-1956'', Groningen: RUG (doctoral thesis, p. 560)</ref> The first theme is exemplified in the poem ''Spiegelschrift'' (Mirror writing):\n\n:We would like to stay\n:together for a long time to come,\n:press our threadbare bodies together\n:firmly yet softly and listen to\n:the wind and rain singing\n:and write the following words\n:on the steamed-up windows:\n:'two children, orphans, sheltered here'\n:from outside it's mirror writing\n:but outsiders needn't read it<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 48</ref>\n\nThe other key theme, the deceased girl, is reminiscent of the poetry of [[Gerrit Achterberg]], which is informed by a similar theme.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 31</ref> Heyting also shares Achterberg's penchant for choosing technical words as titles for poems (''Optiek'', ''Dubbelfocus'', ''Concaaf'').\n\nHeyting's poems often express highly personal sentiments, which was rare in Dr\u00e8ents poetry before the nineteen-eighties.<ref>Nijkeuter (2001) p. 560</ref> Roel Reijntjes saw as Heyting's central theme the pain of being a loner, an outsider, different from others, including physically; socializing with many yet feeling lonely.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32</ref>\n\nUsing the pseudonym Hans Heideknupper, Heyting wrote [[nonsense verse]] which was published in several publications; he prepared a collection of comic poems, ''Het malle vel'' (The silly skin), which was never published.\n\n==Further writing==\nMost of Heyting's books appeared in the seventies and eighties: poetry volumes, translations and nine children's books.\n\nHeyting began to write children's books at the suggestion of writers Gerard Nijenhuis and [[Anne de Vries]]. He wrote them in Dutch (there was no extant market for children's books in Dr\u00e8ents). He felt a strong affinity for children, something about which his friend G. de Jonge declared, \"Hans loved children and this shows clearly in his poetry and writing. Children also loved him. This was obvious when on Saturdays our grandchildren and their parents went to visit the Heytings. (...) Not a word was spoken, gestures and looks of understanding were enough. Hans started to read to the children and their thumbs went into their mouths.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 34</ref>\n\nHeyting's novel ''Om je dood te schamen'' (Shame!) was voted best children's book of the year by a children's jury in 1979; a year later his novel ''Eva en Bert alleen'' (Eva and Bert alone) was awarded the same distinction. Heyting later distanced himself from his early children's books, saying that the publishers had restricted him too much. The stories had to be sweeter than he had intended to write them, and he was asked to scrap passages in Dr\u00e8ents.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 35</ref>  \nHeyting received a lot of fan mail, mainly from girls aged 12 to 15 who wore glasses just like the stories' protagonists. Many of his fans also visited him.\n\nIn 1974, Heyting was awarded the Cultural Prize of Drenthe; in 1979 he received the golden medal of honour in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. Heyting retreated from public life in his final years. He deteriorated physically, suffered pains and had a cancer operated on. When he could no longer cycle, he made his way through the village on an electric motorcycle. He declared to Gerard Nijenhuis, \"I wouldn't like to die, I love life dearly. I think I will reconcile myself with the prospect of death fast. It's just, I would just like to spend some more time with my wife.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 38</ref> Hans Heyting died in 1992 in the Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen.\n\n==After his death==\nA few months after his death, ''Roet'' magazine dedicated an issue to Heyting.\n\nA bust of Heyting by [[Bert Kiewiet]] was placed in the centre of Borger. The plaque reads, \"Writer, poet, recorder of the Dr\u00e8ents language. Co-founder of Dr\u00e8ents monthly OEZE VOLK. The Oeze Volk Foundation has placed this commemorative bust on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. To honour Hans for his services rendered to Drenthe and its language.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drenthe-in-beeld.nl/Borger%20Hans%20Heyting.php |title=Hans Heyting - Drenthe in beeld |publisher=Drenthe-in-beeld.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903122300/http://drenthe-in-beeld.nl/Borger%20Hans%20Heyting.php |archive-date=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Dr\u00e8ents language institute Drentse Taol (now [[Huus van de Taol]]) released a video portrait of Heyting entitled ''Een kapotte bril'' (Broken glasses) on DVD.\n\nIn 2005, publisher [[Het Drentse Boek]] released Heyting's collected poems, ''De dichter en de wichter: verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting''. Edited by Henk Nijkeuter, the collection includes a short biography and a bibliography. The publisher released a CD in 2006, ''Drentse dichters lezen: Hans Heyting'', on which Dr\u00e8ents writers read poems by Heyting.\n\n==Critical assessment==\nHeyting's early dramatic work was received positively: the monthly ''Drenthe'' wrote that his play ''De vr\u00f6mde v\u00f6gel'' \"is vastly better than what has appeared so far in this field\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 27</ref> His children's books were characterized by the Lectuur-repertorium as \"easy-to-read, unpretentious popular stories for young people\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2001) p. 564</ref> ''Dr\u00e8entse schrieverij'', a history of Dr\u00e8ents literature, judges Heyting's book ''Esther en het geheim van opa'' (Esther and grandpa's secret, 1983) to attain the level of well-known children's book author [[Guus Kuijer]].<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 121</ref>\n\nWith regard to Heyting's painting, Drentse Taol refers to his artistic shortcomings, in contrast to the verdict on his poetry, \"His poems in Dr\u00e8ents are among the best work written in Dr\u00e8ents.\"<ref>Drentse Taol, ''Hans Heijting (1918-1992). Schriever van de maond oktober 2005''</ref> ''Dr\u00e8entse schrieverij'' concurs, \"Hans Heyting's work, especially his poetry, has great authority. Coming from the restricted tradition of dialect writing, he innovated it, moving from general themes such as descriptions of nature and village life to writing about issues as personal as grief about a deceased child, longing for a lost love, trying vainly to conquer death. [...] Heyting can be seen as the first true, modern Dr\u00e8ents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways.\"<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 51</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''De kat in 't gaoren.

Heyting's physician Meijering proved another influence on his intellectual development.\n\nHeyting made friends, and fell in love, with Ina Konings, a girl who was sixteen years younger and who lived next door to the Heytings. He painted and drew her and gave her a prominent place in his later poems and children's books. It was long thought that she died of tuberculosis at age thirteen and because of this, lived on as Heyting's muse. Heyting stated: \"She has become my inspiration. She always shows up in my work. (...) Because she died, she stayed alive for me.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30</ref> However, in 2005 Dr\u00e8ents scholar [[Henk Nijkeuter]] established that she was still alive and living abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hetdrentseboek.nl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18:heyting-hans-1918-1992&catid=14&Itemid=27 |title=Heyting, Hans (1918-1992) |publisher=Hetdrentseboek.nl |date=2010-12-24 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Life in Borger==\nIn 1944, during [[World War II]], Heyting went in hiding at a general practitioner's in the village of [[Borger (Drenthe)|Borger]]. He later said, \"At the end of the war, in 1944, I got in trouble with Fritz. I went about freely and that was no longer permitted. I was afraid I'd be arrested.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) pp. 19-20</ref> He briefly returned to Beilen just after the war, but memories of his reformed childhood drove him back to Borger, where he would stay for the rest of his life. He painted in the post-war years, joined the Drents Painters Society and wrote about painting in the periodicals ''Erica'', ''Drenthe'', and ''Nieuwe Drentsche Volksalmanak''.\n\nIn 1946, Heyting lived for a while with painter [[Anton Heyboer]], whose interest in Drenthe had been fanned by [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s letters to his brother Theo. In the same year, Heyting joined the painters' association De Drentse Schilders (which existed from 1946 to 1954) and exhibited his work in Assen and [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]]. Following the exhibitions, he got many commissions for portraiture, but he had a growing conviction that he lacked the requisite talent. About this he wrote in a poem, \"Is it pointless? Something fleeting, this laborious digging down? / Has everything he does not been done better?\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 24</ref> The Drentse Schilders collective disintegrated due to conflicts between members; at one point, Heyting and two of his colleagues had spent the association's funds on booze.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nThe portraits painted by Heyting are in various private collections. Many of his paintings were destroyed when the museum farm he was living in burnt down in 1967. The few extant still lifes show an affinity with the [[Magic Realism (painting)|Magic Realist]] style. After the fire, Heyting focussed more on writing, and \"gradually his work took on a literary dimension\".<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) pp. 120 & 125</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Heyting married Wilhelmina Carolina Hilverink ('Wil') from [[Hengelo]].\n\n==Radio work==\nHeyting became a stage director at the [[chamber of rhetoric|dramatic society]] of Borger. At private parties after performances, he often recited his work, played the [[lute]] and sung his own compositions. In 1950 he was seriously injured when jumping off the stage and was bedridden for almost a year. In 1951, he directed his own play ''De vr\u00f6mde v\u00f6gel'' (The oddball) about a painter who settles in a Drents village.\n\nHe became active as a writer and performer at Regionale Omroep Noord, the regional radio station, and got voice training from the station's director. He wrote Dr\u00e8ents texts for singers De Thrianta's and presented a fortnightly programme on art in Drenthe. Heyting performed in his own radio play ''Schuppen is troef'' and grew out to a popular radio presence in the province. His radio sketches feature village characters, their merits and especially their shortcomings. The Dr\u00e8ents-language programmes on regional radio strongly helped awaken people's interest in the regional language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediedrenthe.nl/RON |title=RON - Encyclopedie Drenthe Online |publisher=Encyclopediedrenthe.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> At age 62, Heyting quit radio work because it was becoming too much of a physical burden.\n\nAt the time of his radio work, Heyting was also employed at the library for the blind in [[Groningen]], for which he selected voices to record material.\n\n==Poetry==\nHeyting published four collections of his own poetry: ''Tweetalig'' (Bilingual, 1973, with poems in Dutch by Harm Werners), ''Spiegelschrift'' (Mirror writing, 1977), ''Toegift'' (Encore, 1983) and ''Dubbelfocus. Een cyclus gedichten'' (Bifocal. A poetry cycle, 1986). As to why he had only collected his poetry at a late stage, he declared, \"You see, I'm not the type to peddle my own work\".<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32</ref>\n\nIn the nineteen-fifties, Heyting was a member of the Drentse Schrieverskring, the Dr\u00e8ents writer's circle. His first poems were published by the Dr\u00e8ents-language monthly ''[[Oeze Volk]]'' which he helped found and of which he was a long-standing editor. In 1966-1967 he was the sole editor for a year, when the editorship was continued by writer [[Bart Veenstra]]. From 1980 on, Heyting published in the avant-garde Dr\u00e8ents literary magazine ''[[Roet (magazine)|Roet]]'', of which he was also an editor for a number of years.\n\nHeyting was initially influenced by traditional Dr\u00e8ents-language poets such as [[L.A. Roessingh]] and [[Jan Naarding]], writing anecdotal verse in archaic Dr\u00e8ents. Later, he was one of the first Dr\u00e8ents poets to distance himself from traditionalist poetry. Dr\u00e8ents poet [[Gerard Nijenhuis]] a friend of Heyting's, wrote about this change, \"Concepts are no longer described in detail, but only hinted at. (...) Moreover, the content becomes more 'condensed'.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30</ref>\n\n[[Marga Kool]], a fellow Dr\u00e8ents poet, discerns two main themes in Heyting's poems, \"the safe home as contrasted with the stupid, frightening outside world\" and \"the girl who has passed away\".<ref>Nijkeuter (2001), ''De \"pen gewijd aan Drenthe's dierbren grond\" : literaire bedrijvigheid in de Olde Lantschap, 1816-1956'', Groningen: RUG (doctoral thesis, p. 560)</ref> The first theme is exemplified in the poem ''Spiegelschrift'' (Mirror writing):\n\n:We would like to stay\n:together for a long time to come,\n:press our threadbare bodies together\n:firmly yet softly and listen to\n:the wind and rain singing\n:and write the following words\n:on the steamed-up windows:\n:'two children, orphans, sheltered here'\n:from outside it's mirror writing\n:but outsiders needn't read it<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 48</ref>\n\nThe other key theme, the deceased girl, is reminiscent of the poetry of [[Gerrit Achterberg]], which is informed by a similar theme.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 31</ref> Heyting also shares Achterberg's penchant for choosing technical words as titles for poems (''Optiek'', ''Dubbelfocus'', ''Concaaf'').\n\nHeyting's poems often express highly personal sentiments, which was rare in Dr\u00e8ents poetry before the nineteen-eighties.<ref>Nijkeuter (2001) p. 560</ref> Roel Reijntjes saw as Heyting's central theme the pain of being a loner, an outsider, different from others, including physically; socializing with many yet feeling lonely.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32</ref>\n\nUsing the pseudonym Hans Heideknupper, Heyting wrote [[nonsense verse]] which was published in several publications; he prepared a collection of comic poems, ''Het malle vel'' (The silly skin), which was never published.\n\n==Further writing==\nMost of Heyting's books appeared in the seventies and eighties: poetry volumes, translations and nine children's books.\n\nHeyting began to write children's books at the suggestion of writers Gerard Nijenhuis and [[Anne de Vries]]. He wrote them in Dutch (there was no extant market for children's books in Dr\u00e8ents). He felt a strong affinity for children, something about which his friend G. de Jonge declared, \"Hans loved children and this shows clearly in his poetry and writing. Children also loved him. This was obvious when on Saturdays our grandchildren and their parents went to visit the Heytings. (...) Not a word was spoken, gestures and looks of understanding were enough. Hans started to read to the children and their thumbs went into their mouths.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 34</ref>\n\nHeyting's novel ''Om je dood te schamen'' (Shame!) was voted best children's book of the year by a children's jury in 1979; a year later his novel ''Eva en Bert alleen'' (Eva and Bert alone) was awarded the same distinction. Heyting later distanced himself from his early children's books, saying that the publishers had restricted him too much. The stories had to be sweeter than he had intended to write them, and he was asked to scrap passages in Dr\u00e8ents.<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 35</ref>  \nHeyting received a lot of fan mail, mainly from girls aged 12 to 15 who wore glasses just like the stories' protagonists. Many of his fans also visited him.\n\nIn 1974, Heyting was awarded the Cultural Prize of Drenthe; in 1979 he received the golden medal of honour in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. Heyting retreated from public life in his final years. He deteriorated physically, suffered pains and had a cancer operated on. When he could no longer cycle, he made his way through the village on an electric motorcycle. He declared to Gerard Nijenhuis, \"I wouldn't like to die, I love life dearly. I think I will reconcile myself with the prospect of death fast. It's just, I would just like to spend some more time with my wife.\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 38</ref> Hans Heyting died in 1992 in the Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen.\n\n==After his death==\nA few months after his death, ''Roet'' magazine dedicated an issue to Heyting.\n\nA bust of Heyting by [[Bert Kiewiet]] was placed in the centre of Borger. The plaque reads, \"Writer, poet, recorder of the Dr\u00e8ents language. Co-founder of Dr\u00e8ents monthly OEZE VOLK. The Oeze Volk Foundation has placed this commemorative bust on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. To honour Hans for his services rendered to Drenthe and its language.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drenthe-in-beeld.nl/Borger%20Hans%20Heyting.php |title=Hans Heyting - Drenthe in beeld |publisher=Drenthe-in-beeld.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903122300/http://drenthe-in-beeld.nl/Borger%20Hans%20Heyting.php |archive-date=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Dr\u00e8ents language institute Drentse Taol (now [[Huus van de Taol]]) released a video portrait of Heyting entitled ''Een kapotte bril'' (Broken glasses) on DVD.\n\nIn 2005, publisher [[Het Drentse Boek]] released Heyting's collected poems, ''De dichter en de wichter: verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting''. Edited by Henk Nijkeuter, the collection includes a short biography and a bibliography. The publisher released a CD in 2006, ''Drentse dichters lezen: Hans Heyting'', on which Dr\u00e8ents writers read poems by Heyting.\n\n==Critical assessment==\nHeyting's early dramatic work was received positively: the monthly ''Drenthe'' wrote that his play ''De vr\u00f6mde v\u00f6gel'' \"is vastly better than what has appeared so far in this field\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2005) p. 27</ref> His children's books were characterized by the Lectuur-repertorium as \"easy-to-read, unpretentious popular stories for young people\"<ref>Nijkeuter (2001) p. 564</ref> ''Dr\u00e8entse schrieverij'', a history of Dr\u00e8ents literature, judges Heyting's book ''Esther en het geheim van opa'' (Esther and grandpa's secret, 1983) to attain the level of well-known children's book author [[Guus Kuijer]].<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 121</ref>\n\nWith regard to Heyting's painting, Drentse Taol refers to his artistic shortcomings, in contrast to the verdict on his poetry, \"His poems in Dr\u00e8ents are among the best work written in Dr\u00e8ents.\"<ref>Drentse Taol, ''Hans Heijting (1918-1992). Schriever van de maond oktober 2005''</ref> ''Dr\u00e8entse schrieverij'' concurs, \"Hans Heyting's work, especially his poetry, has great authority. Coming from the restricted tradition of dialect writing, he innovated it, moving from general themes such as descriptions of nature and village life to writing about issues as personal as grief about a deceased child, longing for a lost love, trying vainly to conquer death. [...] Heyting can be seen as the first true, modern Dr\u00e8ents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways.\"<ref>Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 51</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''De kat in 't gaoren.

Both are fictionalized retellings of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] within the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]]. The film was directed by [[Zack Snyder]], while Miller served as [[executive producer]] and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a [[superimposition]] [[chroma key]] technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.\n\nThe plot revolves around [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]), who leads 300 [[Sparta]]ns into battle against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Sacred king|\"God-King\"]] [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this [[unreliable narrator|narrative technique]], various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].\n\n''300'' was released for the first time in Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006, later released in Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, and finally released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] Disc, and [[HD DVD]] on July 31, 2007. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, which included praise for its original visuals and style but criticism for its depiction of the [[Persians]], which some characterized as bigoted or [[anti-Iranian sentiment|Iranophobic]]. Even so, the film was a box office success, grossing over $450 million, and the film's opening was the 24th-largest in [[box office]] history at the time. A [[sequel]], titled ''[[300: Rise of an Empire|Rise of an Empire]]'', based on Miller's previously unpublished [[graphic novel]] [[prequel]] ''Xerxes'', was released on March 7, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 479 B.C., one year after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Dilios, a [[hoplite]] in the [[Spartan army]], begins his story by depicting the life of [[Leonidas I]] from childhood to kingship via [[Agoge|Spartan doctrine]]. Dilios's story continues and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] herald arrives at the gates of [[Sparta]] demanding \"[[earth and water]]\" as a token of submission to [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]]\u2014the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort into a deep well. Leonidas then visits the [[Ephor]]s, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the [[Thermopylae|Hot Gates]]. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians [[Choke point|into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea]]: negating the Persian advantage in numbers, and giving Greeks [[heavy infantry]] the advantage over the vast waves of Persian [[light infantry]]. The Ephors consult [[Pythia|the Oracle]], who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the [[Carnea|Carneia]]. As Leonidas angrily departs, an agent from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support.\n\nAlthough the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal [[bodyguard]]. They are joined along the way by [[Arcadia]]ns. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall made up of stones and slain Persian scouts as [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], angering a Persian emissary. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders the former to go back to the Persian lines and warn Xerxes, after cutting off his whipping arm.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonidas encounters [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Birth and death|infanticide]]. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the [[phalanx]] formation, and Ephialtes is enraged.\n\nThe battle begins soon after the Spartans' [[Molon labe|refusal to lay down their weapons]]. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. During a lull in the battle, Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his allegiance. Leonidas declines and mocks Xerxes for the inferior quality of his fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the [[Immortals (Achaemenid Empire)|Immortals]], later that night. The Spartans nonetheless manage to defeat the Immortals with few losses, with slight help from the Arcadians.\n\nOn the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states, including [[war elephant]]s, to crush the Spartans once and for all, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened: a \"tale of victory.\"\n\nIn Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] tries to persuade the [[Gerousia|Spartan Council]] to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he \"owns\" the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes' gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes' [[General officer|general]] again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and throws his spear at Xerxes; barely missing him, the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the [[Sacred king|God-King]]'s mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.\n\nDilios, now back in Sparta, concludes his tale before the Council. Inspired by Leonidas' sacrifice, the Greeks mobilize. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans.

Like during the Battle of Marathon 10 years before in 490, the time of Xerxes' invasion of Greece coincided with a Spartan religious festival, the Carneia, in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war. Still, realizing the threat of the Persians, and not want to appear as medizers (Persian sympathizers), the Spartan government, not Leonidas alone, decided to send Leonidas with his personal 300-strong bodyguard, the ''hippeis'', to Thermopylae.<ref>Herodotus 7.206.</ref> Though Sparta only sent 300 men, other Greek ''poleis'' also sent some along with them, totaling somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 total Greek troops.

Both are fictionalized retellings of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] within the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]]. The film was directed by [[Zack Snyder]], while Miller served as [[executive producer]] and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a [[superimposition]] [[chroma key]] technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.\n\nThe plot revolves around [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]), who leads 300 [[Sparta]]ns into battle against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Sacred king|\"God-King\"]] [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this [[unreliable narrator|narrative technique]], various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].\n\n''300'' was released for the first time in Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006, later released in Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, and finally released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] Disc, and [[HD DVD]] on July 31, 2007. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, which included praise for its original visuals and style but criticism for its depiction of the [[Persians]], which some characterized as bigoted or [[anti-Iranian sentiment|Iranophobic]]. Even so, the film was a box office success, grossing over $450 million, and the film's opening was the 24th-largest in [[box office]] history at the time. A [[sequel]], titled ''[[300: Rise of an Empire|Rise of an Empire]]'', based on Miller's previously unpublished [[graphic novel]] [[prequel]] ''Xerxes'', was released on March 7, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 479 B.C., one year after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Dilios, a [[hoplite]] in the [[Spartan army]], begins his story by depicting the life of [[Leonidas I]] from childhood to kingship via [[Agoge|Spartan doctrine]]. Dilios's story continues and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] herald arrives at the gates of [[Sparta]] demanding \"[[earth and water]]\" as a token of submission to [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]]\u2014the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort into a deep well. Leonidas then visits the [[Ephor]]s, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the [[Thermopylae|Hot Gates]]. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians [[Choke point|into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea]]: negating the Persian advantage in numbers, and giving Greeks [[heavy infantry]] the advantage over the vast waves of Persian [[light infantry]]. The Ephors consult [[Pythia|the Oracle]], who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the [[Carnea|Carneia]]. As Leonidas angrily departs, an agent from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support.\n\nAlthough the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal [[bodyguard]]. They are joined along the way by [[Arcadia]]ns. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall made up of stones and slain Persian scouts as [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], angering a Persian emissary. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders the former to go back to the Persian lines and warn Xerxes, after cutting off his whipping arm.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonidas encounters [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Birth and death|infanticide]]. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the [[phalanx]] formation, and Ephialtes is enraged.\n\nThe battle begins soon after the Spartans' [[Molon labe|refusal to lay down their weapons]]. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. During a lull in the battle, Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his allegiance. Leonidas declines and mocks Xerxes for the inferior quality of his fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the [[Immortals (Achaemenid Empire)|Immortals]], later that night. The Spartans nonetheless manage to defeat the Immortals with few losses, with slight help from the Arcadians.\n\nOn the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states, including [[war elephant]]s, to crush the Spartans once and for all, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened: a \"tale of victory.\"\n\nIn Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] tries to persuade the [[Gerousia|Spartan Council]] to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he \"owns\" the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes' gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes' [[General officer|general]] again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and throws his spear at Xerxes; barely missing him, the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the [[Sacred king|God-King]]'s mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.\n\nDilios, now back in Sparta, concludes his tale before the Council. Inspired by Leonidas' sacrifice, the Greeks mobilize. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300, Dilios, now head of the Spartan Army, leads them to war, against the Persians across the fields of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Like during the Battle of Marathon 10 years before in 490, the time of Xerxes' invasion of Greece coincided with a Spartan religious festival, the Carneia, in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war. Still, realizing the threat of the Persians, and not want to appear as medizers (Persian sympathizers), the Spartan government, not Leonidas alone, decided to send Leonidas with his personal 300-strong bodyguard, the ''hippeis'', to Thermopylae.<ref>Herodotus 7.206.</ref> Though Sparta only sent 300 men, other Greek ''poleis'' also sent some along with them, totaling somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 total Greek troops.

Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from Sargodha Air Base to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre's machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet \u2013 beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst that struck the Canberra at an altitude of 47,500 feet and brought it down over Rawat, near Rawalpindi, marking the first aerial victory of the PAF.

Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border it was decided that the best way to deter an Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India's nuclear research facilities at [[Trombay]] in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta.

A level of segregation between the genders is maintained. For example, early-morning parades are performed together but some parts of training, mainly physical exercises, are done with males and females separated. According to Squadron Leader Shazia Ahmed, the officer in charge of the first female cadets and a psychologist, this also improves confidence of the women.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn 2005 it was reported that two batches in the Air Force Academy's flying wing contained 10 women, with many more in the engineering and aerospace wings. Cadet Saba Khan, from [[Quetta]] in [[Balochistan]], applied after reading a newspaper advertisement seeking female cadets. She was one of the first four women to pass the first stages of flying training on propeller-driven light aircraft and move onto faster jet-powered training aircraft.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn March 2006, the PAF inducted a batch of 34 fighter pilots which included the organisation's first four female fighter pilots. Three years of training had been completed by the pilots at [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|PAF Academy Risalpur]] before they graduated and were awarded their Flying Badges during the ceremony. Certificates of honour were handed to the successful cadets by a \"delighted\" General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, vice chief of the Pakistan Army, who acknowledged that the PAF was the first of the Pakistan Armed Forces to introduce women to its combat units. One of the women, Flying Officer Nadia Gul, was awarded a trophy for best academic achievement. The other female graduates were Mariam Khalil, Saira Batool and the above-mentioned Saba Khan.<ref name=\"30 March 2006, BBC News, Pakistan gets women combat pilots\" /> A second batch of pilots, including 3 female pilots, graduated from the 117th GD(P) course at PAF Academy Risalpur in September 2006.

Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from Sargodha Air Base to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre's machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet \u2013 beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst that struck the Canberra at an altitude of 47,500 feet and brought it down over Rawat, near Rawalpindi, marking the first aerial victory of the PAF. Both crew members of the IAF Canberra, ejected and were captured by Pakistani authorities and were subsequently released after remaining in detention for some time.<ref>''History of the Pakistan Air Force 1947\u20131982'', Pakistan Air Force Book Club, 1982 {{page needed|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1965 India\u2013Pakistan War===\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965}}\nThe PAF fleet at the time consisted of 12 F-104 Starfighters, some 120 F-86 Sabres and around 20 B-57 Canberra bombers.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 89)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=89 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114183912/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200111.html?search=Pakistan%20Mirage%205 |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The PAF claims to have had complete air superiority over the battle area from the second day of operations.<ref name=\"Pakistan's Air Power, by John Fricker (page 90)\">{{citation |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Pakistan's Air Power |work=[[Flight International]] |year=1969 |page=90 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112084257/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200112.html |archive-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> While, [[Arjan Singh|Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh]] of the [[Indian Air Force]] claimed, despite been qualitative inferior, [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] achieved air superiority in three days in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 War]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |title=1965 war: We achieved air superiority in three days, says Air Force Marshal Arjan Singh |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614221636/http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/1965-war-we-achieved-air-superiority-in-three-days-says-air-force-marshal-arjan-singh_1805797.html |archive-date=14 June 2016 |url-status=live  |date=4 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMany publications have credited the PAF's successes to U.S. equipment, claiming it to be superior to the aircraft operated by the IAF and giving the PAF a \"qualitative advantage\".

ACM Shamim told General Zia that, \"Indian aircraft could reach the area in 3 minutes whereas the PAF would take 8 minutes, allowing the Indians to attack the facility and return before the PAF could defend it\". Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border it was decided that the best way to deter an Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India's nuclear research facilities at [[Trombay]] in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta. It was decided the most suitable aircraft would be the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]], which the United States eventually agreed to supply after the PAF refused to purchase the [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]] and [[Northrop F-5|F-5G]].

A level of segregation between the genders is maintained. For example, early-morning parades are performed together but some parts of training, mainly physical exercises, are done with males and females separated. According to Squadron Leader Shazia Ahmed, the officer in charge of the first female cadets and a psychologist, this also improves confidence of the women.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn 2005 it was reported that two batches in the Air Force Academy's flying wing contained 10 women, with many more in the engineering and aerospace wings. Cadet Saba Khan, from [[Quetta]] in [[Balochistan]], applied after reading a newspaper advertisement seeking female cadets. She was one of the first four women to pass the first stages of flying training on propeller-driven light aircraft and move onto faster jet-powered training aircraft.<ref name=\"11/05/05, BBC News, Pakistan's first women fighter pilots\" />\n\nIn March 2006, the PAF inducted a batch of 34 fighter pilots which included the organisation's first four female fighter pilots. Three years of training had been completed by the pilots at [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|PAF Academy Risalpur]] before they graduated and were awarded their Flying Badges during the ceremony. Certificates of honour were handed to the successful cadets by a \"delighted\" General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, vice chief of the Pakistan Army, who acknowledged that the PAF was the first of the Pakistan Armed Forces to introduce women to its combat units. One of the women, Flying Officer Nadia Gul, was awarded a trophy for best academic achievement. The other female graduates were Mariam Khalil, Saira Batool and the above-mentioned Saba Khan.<ref name=\"30 March 2006, BBC News, Pakistan gets women combat pilots\" /> A second batch of pilots, including 3 female pilots, graduated from the 117th GD(P) course at PAF Academy Risalpur in September 2006.

The constant factor in his musical backup during almost his entire career has been [[Ton Scherpenzeel]] (keyboardist of [[Kayak (band)|Kayak]]), who has composed almost all of his songs. In most of his shows he also worked with multi-instrumentalist [[Rens van der Zalm]]. The music to Youp's songs is mostly played on [[piano]], [[accordion]], [[violin]] and [[acoustic guitar]], which reflects Youp's preference for classical music. One example of this is his rendition of the song [[Flappie]], ostensibly about a Christmas he experienced in 1961.\n\n== Columns and books ==\nYoup has written columns on sports and later on general topics for NRC Handelsblad since 1988. Several collections of these columns have been published by {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Rap|nl}} publishing. This company was founded by a friend of Youp, and has printed the texts of Van 't Hek's shows from the very first, unsuccessful days, when publishing them seemed a waste of money. Because of this, Youp never switched publishers. A list of the titles of his books that do not contain the texts of his shows:\n\nSports columns:\n* Niks spel, knikkers (\"Not the game, the marbles\", it's the opposite of the saying: \"It's not about the marbles, it's about the game\", meaning that playing is more important than winning) (1989)\n* Het hemd van de leeuw (\"The undershirt of the lion\", reference to a Dutch football song for their national team) (1990)\n* Sportgek (Mad about sports) (1990)\n* Floppie, Yourie en andere helden (Floppie, Yourie and other heroes) (1992)\n* Eerst de man, dan de bal (First the player, then the ball) (1993)\n* De selectie (\"The selection\"/\"The squad\", a compilation of his best sports columns) (1997)\nGeneral columns:\n* Amah hoela (wordplay on [[Amah (occupation)|Amah]], a domestic servant, and a Dutch expression \"Amehoela\" or \"Aan m'n hoela\", meaning \"no way\" or \"my ass\") (1994)\n* Ik schreeuwlelijk (I bigmouth, with bigmouth used as a verb) (1995)\n* En het bleef nog lang onrustig in mijn hoofd (And my mind remained restless for a long time) (1996)\n* Majesteit, (Majesty, ) (1997)\n* Fax ([[Fax]]) (1998)\n* Zaterdag (Saturday) (1999)\n* Het zal me jeuken (literally: \"it could itch me\", meaning \"I couldn't care less\") (2000)\n* Iedereen is in de war (Everybody is confused/crazy) (2001)\n* 166x Youp (a compilation of his best columns) (2001)\n* Het platte land (literally: \"The flat land\", referring to the Netherlands, when written as \"platteland\" it means: \"countryside\") (2002)\n* Liegangst (Fear of lying, wordplay on [[Fear of flying]]) (2003)\n* Hartjeuk en zieleczeem (Hartitch and souleczema) (2004)\n* Het leven is w\u00e9l leuk (Life IS fun, with the emphasis of denying that \"Life sucks\") (2005)\n* Oelikoeli en andere goden (\"Oelikoeli and other gods\", Oelikoeli is a god that Youp made up.

In most of his shows he also worked with multi-instrumentalist [[Rens van der Zalm]]. The music to Youp's songs is mostly played on [[piano]], [[accordion]], [[violin]] and [[acoustic guitar]], which reflects Youp's preference for classical music. One example of this is his rendition of the song [[Flappie]], ostensibly about a Christmas he experienced in 1961.\n\n== Columns and books ==\nYoup has written columns on sports and later on general topics for NRC Handelsblad since 1988. Several collections of these columns have been published by {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Rap|nl}} publishing. This company was founded by a friend of Youp, and has printed the texts of Van 't Hek's shows from the very first, unsuccessful days, when publishing them seemed a waste of money. Because of this, Youp never switched publishers. A list of the titles of his books that do not contain the texts of his shows:\n\nSports columns:\n* Niks spel, knikkers (\"Not the game, the marbles\", it's the opposite of the saying: \"It's not about the marbles, it's about the game\", meaning that playing is more important than winning) (1989)\n* Het hemd van de leeuw (\"The undershirt of the lion\", reference to a Dutch football song for their national team) (1990)\n* Sportgek (Mad about sports) (1990)\n* Floppie, Yourie en andere helden (Floppie, Yourie and other heroes) (1992)\n* Eerst de man, dan de bal (First the player, then the ball) (1993)\n* De selectie (\"The selection\"/\"The squad\", a compilation of his best sports columns) (1997)\nGeneral columns:\n* Amah hoela (wordplay on [[Amah (occupation)|Amah]], a domestic servant, and a Dutch expression \"Amehoela\" or \"Aan m'n hoela\", meaning \"no way\" or \"my ass\") (1994)\n* Ik schreeuwlelijk (I bigmouth, with bigmouth used as a verb) (1995)\n* En het bleef nog lang onrustig in mijn hoofd (And my mind remained restless for a long time) (1996)\n* Majesteit, (Majesty, ) (1997)\n* Fax ([[Fax]]) (1998)\n* Zaterdag (Saturday) (1999)\n* Het zal me jeuken (literally: \"it could itch me\", meaning \"I couldn't care less\") (2000)\n* Iedereen is in de war (Everybody is confused/crazy) (2001)\n* 166x Youp (a compilation of his best columns) (2001)\n* Het platte land (literally: \"The flat land\", referring to the Netherlands, when written as \"platteland\" it means: \"countryside\") (2002)\n* Liegangst (Fear of lying, wordplay on [[Fear of flying]]) (2003)\n* Hartjeuk en zieleczeem (Hartitch and souleczema) (2004)\n* Het leven is w\u00e9l leuk (Life IS fun, with the emphasis of denying that \"Life sucks\") (2005)\n* Oelikoeli en andere goden (\"Oelikoeli and other gods\", Oelikoeli is a god that Youp made up.

A [[remake]] of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]] and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]], it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Gabriel Bateman]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]], and [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]. It is an international co-production of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe development of a ''Child's Play'' remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 [[science fiction film]], ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Principal photography]] lasted from September to November 2018 in [[Vancouver]], Canada.\n\n''Child's Play'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by [[Orion Pictures]] through [[United Artists|United Artists Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At an assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend other two children in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. He tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris and his partner Willis begin an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Norris and Willis travel to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Willis is murdered, Norris is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky managed to transfer his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n** Hamill also voices other ''Buddi'' dolls seen in the film, and previously voiced Chucky on an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...

A [[remake]] of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]] and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]], it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Gabriel Bateman]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]], and [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]. It is an international co-production of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe development of a ''Child's Play'' remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 [[science fiction film]], ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Principal photography]] lasted from September to November 2018 in [[Vancouver]], Canada.\n\n''Child's Play'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by [[Orion Pictures]] through [[United Artists|United Artists Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At an assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend other two children in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. He tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris and his partner Willis begin an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Norris and Willis travel to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Willis is murdered, Norris is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky managed to transfer his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n** Hamill also voices other ''Buddi'' dolls seen in the film, and previously voiced Chucky on an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...
