She has become a burnt-out, depressed alcoholic, estranged from her husband Adam and young daughter Marcie, and is tormented by nightmares of the event that got her removed from the force four years earlier: Her manhunt in Maris Creek for [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] and suspected serial killer Victor Orbin led to a [[SWAT]] team gunning down an innocent man working at the site. Orbin, who was never at the scene, is presumed still at large.\n\nEllis reappears in [[Portland]], strangling and castrating [[Internal Affairs]] investigator Fred Tierney, who was responsible for Lucinda's removal. Detective Travis Adler recognizes the murder as being Orbin's [[modus operandi]], and thinks the killer may have resurfaced. He asks Lucinda to return to the force to head the case and track down Orbin for good, but she refuses, rattled when learning of Ellis's escape.\n\nEllis kills an insurance salesman, puts on his clothes, drives to a house and murders the man who answers the door. Both men are strangled and castrated to [[copycat crime|copycat]] Orbin. Lucinda discovers that the house was her childhood home. She and Ellis were [[child abuse|abuse]]d by their alcoholic father, long dead of an ilness, and she always tried to take the brunt of it, swearing to always look after Ellis. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Arthur Fortis, Junior, brought on the case as an advisor, answers a phone call to Lucinda from Ellis, who reveals details of Tierney's murder and demands his sister be put on the case.\n\nLucinda finds a coded note from Ellis in the house's attic, revealing his apparent willingness to surrender to her that night. She figures out the location and stakes it out with Travis, Junior and their team. Ellis calls her, seemingly taunting her with riddles from their childhood, and his location is traced to a homeless shelter across the street. Everyone races there, but Lucinda realizes it is a setup. A booby trap in the room explodes, injuring Junior and several other officers.\n\nEllis escapes and later poses as a camper in [[Crater Lake National Park]], where he meets a boy named Kelly. Seeing that Kelly is being abused by his father, Ellis kidnaps him after murdering his father and tying up his mother.\n\nA clue left at the house murder leads Lucinda to her father's old office. In the basement, she finds a skeleton in a refrigerator. As the team converges on the park, they learn that the skeleton is Victor Orbin's, and he was dead before the events at Maris Creek, having in fact been previously buried there. Lucinda realizes that Ellis committed all the murders, killed Orbin and framed him, believing that Lucinda would find the body, figure out Ellis was responsible, and come after him. The innocent worker's death was an unforseen circumstance. With Lucinda pulled from duty and unable to protect Ellis, he was imprisoned on unrelated charges, which explains why \"Orbin\" stopped killing. Lucinda now knows that Ellis wants her to kill him, to spare her of always having to be her brother's keeper. She is determined to bring him in alive.\n\nAs Lucinda and Junior search the forest, she is injured by one of Ellis's traps. Junior performs first aid and heads back to their SUV, where Ellis ambushes and stabs him. Lucinda hears the struggle and finds Junior wounded but alive. She presses a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] beacon on his wrist, alerting the team to their location, then finds Ellis holding Kelly at gunpoint. Ellis begs her to kill him, but she refuses, wounding him and letting Kelly run away. A police sniper fires at Ellis; Lucinda dives in front of the bullet, but it goes through her shoulder and into his chest. As Ellis dies in her arms, he says that he has been killing \"just one person\" \u2013 their father \u2013 and that \"he kept coming back\".\n\nLater, Travis drops Lucinda off at Adam's house, where she reconciles with him and Marcie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Lucinda Pond\n* [[Corin Nemec]] as Ellis Pond\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Travis Adler\n* [[Evan Parke]] as Junior\n* Brian Jensen as David Pond\n* Ben Cardinal as Running Bear\n* [[Britt McKillip]] as Young Lucinda / Marcie\n* [[Cameron Bright]] as Young Ellis\n* [[Andrew Jackson (actor)|Andrew Jackson]] as Adam\n* William S.

{"title_page": "Vietnamese art", "text_new": "{{Culture of Vietnam}}\n'''Vietnamese art'''  is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.\n\nVietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]].<ref name=\"vietnamese art artists history\">{{cite web|publisher= widewalls|title=vietnamese art artists history|url= https://www.widewalls.ch/vietnamese-art-artists-history/    }}</ref>\n\nWith the millennium of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.\n\nBy the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.\n\n==Traditional art==\n\n===Neolithic art===\n[[File:Gom1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth]]\nPottery dating to the [[Stone Age]] [[(c. 8000 BCE)]] has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, [[Vietnamese pottery]] and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.\n\n===Bronze Age art===\n\nThe highly developed [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] that flourished in [[North Vietnam]] (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n drums]], a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.\n\nThese drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with [[geometric patterns]], and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.\n\nArchaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.\n\n===Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD===\nDuring the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.<ref>http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule</ref>\n\n===From the Ng\u00f4 to Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty===\n\nVietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and later [[Song Dynasty]]'s art, including applying the \"three colors\" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as [[Confucianism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of [[Art of Champa|Cham]] influences to be found as well.\n\nThe [[L\u00fd Dynasty]], beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The L\u00fd Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |title=VietNamNet Bridge<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504205207/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Fourth Chinese domination and L\u00ea Dynasty===\n[[File:DoGo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century]]\nThe [[fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]] was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of [[sinicization]] was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.\n\nConsequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the [[L\u00ea Dynasty]] was heavily influenced by the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s art.\n\n====Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty====\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty.\n\n==Modern art==\nVietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between the 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of \u201c[[\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de L'Indochine|Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]]\u201d in October 1925.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Viet Nam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Esapce M\u00e9ridien|pages=47}}</ref> Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA striking \u201cshift\u201d was obvious after the founding of [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art's sake.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for Symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=12}}</ref> Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying [[Cultural transformation theory|cultural transfer]] and [[modernity]].\n\n=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===\n[[File:X\u00e3-X\u1ec7 et L\u00fd-To\u00e9t.jpg|thumb|A cartoon illustrated in Phong Hoa|alt=|left]]\n[[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] EBAI was founded by [[Victor Tardieu]], a French academic and naturalist painter.<ref>ibid, p5</ref> With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school \u201cEBAI in Indochina\u201d to train real artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Art from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace M\u00e9ridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}</ref> Unlike, Ecole professionnelle\u201d in Hanoi, \u201cEcole des Arts Cambodgeins\u201d  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 \u2013 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen.<ref name=\":1\" /> Tardieu's idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in \u201cEcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris\u201d by including art history;

It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by [[Nam S\u01a1n|Nam Son]], Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as \u201cnational\u201d.<ref name=\":8\" />\n[[File:Tran Van Can - Painting 2.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Female Militia in the Sea Tran Van Can.jpg|left|thumb|Female Militia in the Sea 1960 Tran Van Can]]\nIn [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n C\u1ea9n|Tran Van Can]]\u2019s Portrait painting \u201c''Militia women of a costal region''\u201d, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy.

The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.\n[[File:Approaching Khe Sanh Pham Thanh Tam.jpg|left|thumb|Approaching Khe Sanh.

Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh's concept, was to \"stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development\".<sup>[23]</sup>\n\n\u201cCulture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.\u201d <sup>[24]</sup>\n\n\"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond.\"<sup>[25]</sup>\n\n==== Artists in the South ====\nVietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United States of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is [[T\u1ea1 T\u1ef5|Ta Ty]], who \" considerably bolstered the South\u2019s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2015/10/09/5-artists-to-know-from-the-vietnamese-young-artists-association/|title=5 artists to know from the Vietnamese Young Artists Association}}</ref>\n\nNguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for \u201c[[Ecole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh]]\" founded in 1954.<sup>[26]</sup> Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.<sup>[27]</sup>\n\nIn 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\nBetween 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.\n\nAfter the [[Reunification Day|reunification of Vietnam]], southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\n1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\n=== The Period of Renewal from 1985 ===\nArtists benefited from greater freedom of expression after the launch of the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] campaign. The economic reforms allowed artists a greater outlet for creative expressions.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\nHowever, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine ''My Thuat'' (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.<sup>[28]</sup> The workshop was not acceptable by authority for \"the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community.\"<sup>[29]</sup>\n\n==Contemporary Art==\nNowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.<ref>http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future-of-contemporary-art/</ref> For example, [[Nha San Collective]] (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.<ref>http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most-influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/</ref> Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s\n<ref>http://www.lasalle.edu.sg/trending-stories/in-conversation-with-jeffrey-say/</ref>\n\nRMIT University Vietnam art collection is one of the most prestigious collections of contemporary Vietnamese art in the world. This collection is not only historically important, but one that will continue to grow the understanding of Vietnamese culture for generations to come. The Vietnamese artists in the collection range from established and mid-career artists, whose works feature in significant exhibitions and notable private collections and public institutions worldwide, to young emerging artists who continue to tackle issues with fresh and new interpretations.\nRMIT University is at the forefront of creative education and this collection allows both students and the wider community to experience the artistic expression of an important generation of contemporary Vietnamese artists. The art collection is managed by the RMIT Library Vietnam.\n\n==Cinema==\n{{main|Cinema of Vietnam}}\n\n==Architecture==\nIt is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.\n\nWhen Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, [[Chinese architecture]] had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|scholar-bureaucrats]], aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.\nWith French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the [[French Indochina|French colonial legacy]].\n\nSome of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:\n\n*The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] or (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu): Located in [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]].  It was constructed during the [[L\u00fd Dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Confucius]] and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of L\u00fd Dynasty architecture, although much of it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone [[stele]]s.  These steles are placed on top of [[bixi (tortoise)|stone turtles]], and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the [[Imperial examination]].  Also within the temple lies the \"Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m\" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.\n*[[Imperial City, Hu\u1ebf]]: During the reign of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], a new imperial citadel in [[Hu\u1ebf]] was built, largely based on the Chinese [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], and also called the [[Imperial City, Hu\u1ebf|Purple Forbidden City]].  However, it still employed many obvious Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures were built later, such as the outlying tomb of [[Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh]], which used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]] is often considered as one of the most beautiful structures in Hu\u1ebf, situated near a vast lotus pond. Its construction was not completed until after Minh M\u1ea1ng's death. The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it had been destroyed and later turned into [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].  The remaining areas are currently being restored by [[UNESCO]].\n*[[One Pillar Pagoda]]: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of [[Hanoi]], its design credited to Emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In gratitude and reverence of his dream he ordered the construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.\n*[[Perfume Pagoda]]:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located in the Perfume Mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: \"Heaven's gate\" and \"Hell's gate\".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple. The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding areas have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.\n\n==Calligraphy==\n{{main|Vietnamese calligraphy}}\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]].  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at [[temple]] shrines.\n\n==Visual arts==\n\n===Silk painting===\n[[File:Nguyen Trai.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The [[silk painting]] of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] (15th century)]]\nVietnamese [[silk painting]] is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.<ref>[http://www.asia-art.net/vietnam_silk.html Art of Vietnam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.\n\n===Woodblock prints===\n[[File:Dong Ho painting - Ly Ngu vong nguyet.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical [[Vietnamese woodblock prints|\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 folk woodblock print]] of a carp]]\nA folk art with a long history in Vietnam, [[Vietnamese woodblock prints]] have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.<ref>Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin).

Some of the most widely known genres include:\n\n*[[Quan h\u1ecd]]: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.\n*Imperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the \"[[Nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c]]\" form it includes court music from the [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] on to the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]].  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.\n*[[Ca tr\u00f9]]: An ancient form of [[chamber music]] which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a [[geisha]]-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with [[prostitution]], but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a potential [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].\n\n===Traditional theatre===\n[[File:G\u00e1nh h\u00e1t Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh trong l\u1ec5 T\u1ee9 tu\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i kh\u00e1nh c\u1ee7a Ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh (1924).jpg|thumb|300px|Tuong theatre actors.]]\nGenres include:\n*[[C\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng]]: A kind of modern folk opera originating in [[South Vietnam]], which utilizes extensive [[vibrato]] techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.\n*[[H\u00e1t ch\u00e8o]]: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca tr\u00f9 which was favored more by scholars and elites.\n*H\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng (also known as H\u00e1t b\u1ed9i): A theatre form strongly influenced by [[Chinese opera]], it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known [[stock characters]].\n\n===Traditional dance===\n{{main|Traditional Vietnamese dance}}\nVietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the [[lion dance]].\n\nIn the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.\n\n===Water puppetry===\n[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi]]\n[[Water puppetry]] is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.\n\n==Language arts==\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Vietnamese literature}}\n'''Vietnamese literature''' is [[literature]], both oral and written, created largely by [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-speaking]] people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in [[Classical Chinese]]. [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]], created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ''ch\u1eef n\u00f4m'' and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]] script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in [[French Indochina]].  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in ''qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef''.\n\nSome defining works of literature include ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' by [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]], and ''[[L\u1ee5c V\u00e2n Ti\u00ean]]'' by [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u]].\n\n===Poetry===\n{{main|Vietnamese poetry}}\nPoet [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], and most of it has been translated into [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]] for modern Vietnamese.

However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.\n\nBy the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.\n\n==Traditional art==\n\n===Neolithic art===\n[[File:Gom1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth]]\nPottery dating to the [[Stone Age]] [[(c. 8000 BCE)]] has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, [[Vietnamese pottery]] and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.\n\n===Bronze Age art===\n\nThe highly developed [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] that flourished in [[North Vietnam]] (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n drums]], a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.\n\nThese drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with [[geometric patterns]], and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.\n\nArchaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.\n\n===Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD===\nDuring the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.<ref>http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule</ref>\n\n===From the Ng\u00f4 to Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty===\n\nVietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and later [[Song Dynasty]]'s art, including applying the \"three colors\" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as [[Confucianism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of [[Art of Champa|Cham]] influences to be found as well.\n\nThe [[L\u00fd Dynasty]], beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The L\u00fd Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |title=VietNamNet Bridge<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504205207/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Fourth Chinese domination and L\u00ea Dynasty===\n[[File:DoGo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century]]\nThe [[fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]] was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of [[sinicization]] was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.\n\nConsequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the [[L\u00ea Dynasty]] was heavily influenced by the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s art.\n\n====Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty====\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty.\n\n==Modern art==\nVietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between the 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of \u201c[[\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de L'Indochine|Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]]\u201d in October 1925.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Viet Nam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Esapce M\u00e9ridien|pages=47}}</ref> Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA striking \u201cshift\u201d was obvious after the founding of [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art's sake.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for Symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=12}}</ref> Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying [[Cultural transformation theory|cultural transfer]] and [[modernity]].\n\n=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===\n[[File:X\u00e3-X\u1ec7 et L\u00fd-To\u00e9t.jpg|thumb|A cartoon illustrated in Phong Hoa|alt=|left]]\n[[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] EBAI was founded by [[Victor Tardieu]], a French academic and naturalist painter.<ref>ibid, p5</ref> With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school \u201cEBAI in Indochina\u201d to train real artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Art from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace M\u00e9ridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}</ref> Unlike, Ecole professionnelle\u201d in Hanoi, \u201cEcole des Arts Cambodgeins\u201d  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 \u2013 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen.<ref name=\":1\" /> Tardieu's idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in \u201cEcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris\u201d by including art history;

The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as \u201cnational\u201d.<ref name=\":8\" />\n[[File:Tran Van Can - Painting 2.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Female Militia in the Sea Tran Van Can.jpg|left|thumb|Female Militia in the Sea 1960 Tran Van Can]]\nIn [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n C\u1ea9n|Tran Van Can]]\u2019s Portrait painting \u201c''Militia women of a costal region''\u201d, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAnother theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the [[Di\u1ec7p Minh Ch\u00e2u|Diep Minh Chau]]\u2019s \u201cUncle Ho\u2019s House in Viet Bac\u201d show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves.\n\nIn [[Duong Huong Minh]]\u2019s \u201cHauling Up Canons\u201d a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.\n[[File:Approaching Khe Sanh Pham Thanh Tam.jpg|left|thumb|Approaching Khe Sanh. A watercolour completed by Pham Thanh Tam in December 1967]]\nSimilarly, in watercolour painting painted by [[Pham Thanh Tam]] during resistance war \u2018shows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI\u201d the drawings and diary clearly contents \u201clyrical and poetic quality\u201d it was regarded as ideal paintings.<sup>[21]</sup>\n\nHence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that \u201cthe realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.\u201d<sup>[22]</sup> Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French.\n\n==== Propaganda Posters ====\n[[File:South Vietnam propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|A South Vietnamese propaganda poster depicting the countryside]]\nPropaganda poster painted during the period of \u201coperation rolling thunder\u201d in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh's concept, was to \"stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development\".<sup>[23]</sup>\n\n\u201cCulture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.\u201d <sup>[24]</sup>\n\n\"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond.\"<sup>[25]</sup>\n\n==== Artists in the South ====\nVietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United States of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is [[T\u1ea1 T\u1ef5|Ta Ty]], who \" considerably bolstered the South\u2019s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2015/10/09/5-artists-to-know-from-the-vietnamese-young-artists-association/|title=5 artists to know from the Vietnamese Young Artists Association}}</ref>\n\nNguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for \u201c[[Ecole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh]]\" founded in 1954.<sup>[26]</sup> Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.<sup>[27]</sup>\n\nIn 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\nBetween 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.\n\nAfter the [[Reunification Day|reunification of Vietnam]], southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\n1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\n=== The Period of Renewal from 1985 ===\nArtists benefited from greater freedom of expression after the launch of the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] campaign. The economic reforms allowed artists a greater outlet for creative expressions.<sup>[14]</sup>\n\nHowever, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine ''My Thuat'' (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.<sup>[28]</sup> The workshop was not acceptable by authority for \"the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community.\"<sup>[29]</sup>\n\n==Contemporary Art==\nNowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.<ref>http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future-of-contemporary-art/</ref> For example, [[Nha San Collective]] (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.<ref>http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most-influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/</ref> Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s\n<ref>http://www.lasalle.edu.sg/trending-stories/in-conversation-with-jeffrey-say/</ref>\n\nRMIT University Vietnam art collection is one of the most prestigious collections of contemporary Vietnamese art in the world. This collection is not only historically important, but one that will continue to grow the understanding of Vietnamese culture for generations to come. The Vietnamese artists in the collection range from established and mid-career artists, whose works feature in significant exhibitions and notable private collections and public institutions worldwide, to young emerging artists who continue to tackle issues with fresh and new interpretations.\nRMIT University is at the forefront of creative education and this collection allows both students and the wider community to experience the artistic expression of an important generation of contemporary Vietnamese artists. The art collection is managed by the RMIT Library Vietnam.\n\n==Cinema==\n{{main|Cinema of Vietnam}}\n\n==Architecture==\nIt is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.\n\nWhen Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, [[Chinese architecture]] had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|scholar-bureaucrats]], aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.\nWith French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the [[French Indochina|French colonial legacy]].\n\nSome of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:\n\n*The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] or (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu): Located in [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]].  It was constructed during the [[L\u00fd Dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Confucius]] and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of L\u00fd Dynasty architecture, although much of it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone [[stele]]s.  These steles are placed on top of [[bixi (tortoise)|stone turtles]], and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the [[Imperial examination]].  Also within the temple lies the \"Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m\" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.\n*[[Imperial City, Hu\u1ebf]]: During the reign of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], a new imperial citadel in [[Hu\u1ebf]] was built, largely based on the Chinese [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], and also called the [[Imperial City, Hu\u1ebf|Purple Forbidden City]].  However, it still employed many obvious Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures were built later, such as the outlying tomb of [[Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh]], which used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]] is often considered as one of the most beautiful structures in Hu\u1ebf, situated near a vast lotus pond. Its construction was not completed until after Minh M\u1ea1ng's death. The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it had been destroyed and later turned into [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].  The remaining areas are currently being restored by [[UNESCO]].\n*[[One Pillar Pagoda]]: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of [[Hanoi]], its design credited to Emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In gratitude and reverence of his dream he ordered the construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.\n*[[Perfume Pagoda]]:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located in the Perfume Mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: \"Heaven's gate\" and \"Hell's gate\".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple. The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding areas have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.\n\n==Calligraphy==\n{{main|Vietnamese calligraphy}}\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]].  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at [[temple]] shrines.\n\n==Visual arts==\n\n===Silk painting===\n[[File:Nguyen Trai.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The [[silk painting]] of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] (15th century)]]\nVietnamese [[silk painting]] is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.<ref>[http://www.asia-art.net/vietnam_silk.html Art of Vietnam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.\n\n===Woodblock prints===\n[[File:Dong Ho painting - Ly Ngu vong nguyet.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical [[Vietnamese woodblock prints|\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 folk woodblock print]] of a carp]]\nA folk art with a long history in Vietnam, [[Vietnamese woodblock prints]] have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.<ref>Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin).

Some of the most widely known genres include:\n\n*[[Quan h\u1ecd]]: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.\n*Imperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the \"[[Nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c]]\" form it includes court music from the [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] on to the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]].  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.\n*[[Ca tr\u00f9]]: An ancient form of [[chamber music]] which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a [[geisha]]-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with [[prostitution]], but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a potential [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].\n\n===Traditional theatre===\n[[File:G\u00e1nh h\u00e1t Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh trong l\u1ec5 T\u1ee9 tu\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i kh\u00e1nh c\u1ee7a Ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh (1924).jpg|thumb|300px|Tuong theatre actors.]]\nGenres include:\n*[[C\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng]]: A kind of modern folk opera originating in [[South Vietnam]], which utilizes extensive [[vibrato]] techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.\n*[[H\u00e1t ch\u00e8o]]: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca tr\u00f9 which was favored more by scholars and elites.\n*H\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng (also known as H\u00e1t b\u1ed9i): A theatre form strongly influenced by [[Chinese opera]], it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known [[stock characters]].\n\n===Traditional dance===\n{{main|Traditional Vietnamese dance}}\nVietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the [[lion dance]].\n\nIn the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.\n\n===Water puppetry===\n[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi]]\n[[Water puppetry]] is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.\n\n==Language arts==\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Vietnamese literature}}\n'''Vietnamese literature''' is [[literature]], both oral and written, created largely by [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-speaking]] people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in [[Classical Chinese]]. [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]], created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ''ch\u1eef n\u00f4m'' and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]] script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in [[French Indochina]].  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in ''qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef''.\n\nSome defining works of literature include ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' by [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]], and ''[[L\u1ee5c V\u00e2n Ti\u00ean]]'' by [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u]].\n\n===Poetry===\n{{main|Vietnamese poetry}}\nPoet [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], and most of it has been translated into [[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]] for modern Vietnamese.  Her poetry continues to be widely popular.  Other poets such as the famous [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin official]] [[Duong Khue]] had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the [[Ca tr\u00f9]]-genre song \"H\u1ed3ng h\u1ed3ng, tuy\u1ebft tuy\u1ebft\".\n\nMany Vietnamese poems, along with folk \"literature\" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Culture of Vietnam]]\n*[[History of Vietnam]]\n*[[Vietnamese studies]]\n*[[Censorship in Vietnam]]\n*[[Linh Chi]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author= Lerner, Martin | title= ''The flame and the lotus: Indian and Southeast Asian art from the Kronos collections'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=1984 | isbn=0870993747 | url= http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/105494}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Art of Vietnam}}\n* [http://www.viettouch.com/ Viettouch].
