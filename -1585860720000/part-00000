It was published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986 and 1987, and collected in a single volume edition in 1987. ''Watchmen'' originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring [[superhero]] characters that the company had acquired from [[Charlton Comics]]. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor [[Dick Giordano]] convinced Moore to create original characters instead.\n\nMoore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. ''Watchmen'' depicts an [[alternate history]] where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate break-in]] was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward [[World War III]] with the [[Soviet Union]], freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and [[Moral ambiguity|moral struggles]] of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.\n\nCreatively, the focus of ''Watchmen'' is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained [[smiley|smiley face]]. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a [[nonlinear narrative]], the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, [[coincidence]] and repeated imagery.\n\nA commercial success, ''Watchmen'' has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. ''Watchmen'' was recognized in ''Time''{{'}}s [[Time's List of the 100 Best Novels|List of the 100 Best Novels]] as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the [[BBC]]'s Nicholas Barber<!-- writer redlinked at [[Nicholas Barber]] \"who worked with Nick Percival\"? --> described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160809-watchmen-the-moment-comic-books-grew-up|title=Watchmen: The moment comic books grew up|last=Barber|first=Nicholas|date=August 9, 2016|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' was released in 2009. A video game series, ''[[Watchmen: The End Is Nigh]]'', was released in the same year to coincide with the film's release.\n\nDC Comics published ''[[Before Watchmen]]'', a series of nine [[prequel]] miniseries, in 2012, and ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', a 12-issue limited series and [[sequel]] to the original ''Watchmen'' series, from 2017 to 2019 \u2013 both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement. The second series integrated the ''Watchmen'' characters within the [[DC Universe]]. A [[Watchmen (TV series)|television continuation]] to the original comic ignoring the events of ''Doomsday Clock'', set 34 years after the comic's timeline, was broadcast on [[HBO]] from October to December 2019 with Gibbons' involvement.\n\nMoore has expressed his displeasure with later adaptations and asked that Watchmen not be adapted for future works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1732050/why-alan-moore-wants-nothing-to-do-with-hbos-watchmen/|title=HBO\u2019s \u201cWatchmen\u201d is great.

The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The [[point of divergence]] occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"Wright271\">Wright, p. 271</ref> In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of ''Watchmen'' are commonly called \"superheroes\", only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities.<ref name=\"Wright272\">Wright, p. 272</ref> The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the [[Watergate scandal]] not coming to pass. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] occurs approximately six years later than in real life.\n\nWhen the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the [[Soviet Union]], which has dramatically increased [[Cold War]] tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] continues to operate outside the law.<ref name=\"Reynolds106\">Reynolds, p. 106</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn October 1985, New York City detectives are investigating the murder of Edward Blake. With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Rorschach deduces Blake to have been the true identity of The Comedian, a costumed hero employed by the U.S. government, after finding his costume and signature smiley-face pin badge. Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades: Daniel Dreiberg (an inventor and formerly the second Nite Owl), the superpowered and emotionally detached Jon Osterman (codenamed Doctor Manhattan) and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk (the second Silk Spectre), and Adrian Veidt (once the hero [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], and now a successful businessman).\nDreiberg, Veidt, and Manhattan attend Blake's funeral, where Dreiberg tosses Blake's pin badge in his coffin before he is buried. Manhattan is later accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As the U.S. depends on Manhattan as a strategic military asset, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviets invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt. Rorschach himself is framed for murdering a former supervillain named Moloch. Though he attempted to flee from the authorities, Rorschach is ultimately captured and unmasked as Walter Kovacs. \n\nNeglected in her relationship with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings, and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg. They begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's [[conspiracy theory]], the pair takes it upon themselves to break him out of prison. After looking back on his own personal history, Manhattan places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother (the original Silk Spectre), was, in fact, her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.\n\nOn Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy and find evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, in which he has been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to ''New Frontiersman'', a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war by faking an alien invasion in New York, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the superpowers against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent. They say that they will stop him, but Veidt reveals that he already enacted his plan before they arrived.\n\nWhen Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, they are confronted by mass destruction and death in New York, with a gigantic squid-like [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|creature]], created by Veidt's laboratories, dead in the middle of the city. Manhattan notices his [[Precognition|prescient]] abilities are limited by [[tachyon]]s emanating from the Antarctic and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing the truth is in the best interests of world peace. Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan who argues at this point, the truth can only hurt. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does.

Of Polish heritage, she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years.

In a 1986 interview, Moore said, \"What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating\", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that ''Watchmen'' was designed to be read \"four or five times\", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings.<ref name=\"strange\" /> Dave Gibbons notes that, \"[a]s it progressed, ''Watchmen'' became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a [[macguffin]], a [[gimmick]] ...

Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nColorist John Higgins used a template that was \"moodier\" and favored secondary colors.<ref name=\"EW article 3\" /> Moore stated that he had also \"always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an [[airbrush]] colorist\", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color ''Watchmen'' in European-style flat color.

The whole of the issue's layout was intended to be symmetrical, culminating in this center spread, where the pages reflect one another. Art by Dave Gibbons]]\n\nStructurally, certain aspects of ''Watchmen'' deviated from the norm in comic books at the time, particularly the panel layout and the coloring. Instead of panels of various sizes, the creators divided each page into a nine-panel grid.<ref name=\"EW article 3\" /> Gibbons favored the nine-panel grid system due to its \"authority\".<ref name=\"Artists80\" /> Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which \"gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn't had previously\", according to Gibbons. \"There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect.\"<ref name=\"Salisbury\"/> [[Bhob Stewart]] of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' mentioned to Gibbons in 1987, that the page layouts recalled those of [[EC Comics]], in addition to the art itself, which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of [[John Severin]].<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC-style layouts \"was a very deliberate thing\", although his inspiration was rather [[Harvey Kurtzman]],<ref name=\"Comics Bulletin\"/> but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look.<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> The artist also cited Steve Ditko's work on early issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as an influence,<ref>Salisbury, p. 77\u201380</ref> as well as ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', where \"even at his most psychedelic [he] would still keep a pretty straight page layout\".<ref name=illustrating/>\n\nThe cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story. Gibbons said, \"The cover of the ''Watchmen'' is in the real world and looks quite real, but it's starting to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present.<ref name=\"strange\" /> The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled \"Fearful Symmetry\", so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the following pages mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nThe end of each issue, with the exception of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various ''Watchmen'' characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of ''Watchmen'', which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory.<ref name=\"CBR Amaya 2008\" /> Moore said, \"By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\n===''Tales of the Black Freighter''===\n{{for|the direct-to-video supplement to the comic book's film adaptation|Watchmen (film)#Home media}}\n\n''Watchmen'' features a [[story within a story]] in the form of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic's story, \"Marooned\", is read by a youth in New York City.<ref name=\"Reynolds\"/> Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of ''Watchmen'' experience superheroes in real life, \"they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics.\"<ref name=\"Blather Moore Interview 3\">Kavanagh, Barry. \"[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/watchmen3.html The Alan Moore Interview: Watchmen, microcosms and details]\".

Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent\u2014with EC riding the crest of the wave.\" Moore felt \"the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of ''Watchmen''\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/> The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presence in the story would add [[subtext]] and allegory.<ref>Salisbury, p. 80\u201382</ref> The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' at the end of issue five credits real-life artist [[Joe Orlando]] as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the ''Watchmen'' universe that DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.<ref name=\"S&S116\"/>\n\nIn \"Marooned\", a young mariner (called \"The Sea Captain\") journeys to warn his hometown of the coming of ''The Black Freighter'', after he survives the destruction of his own ship. He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft. When he finally returns home, believing it to be already under the occupation of ''The Black Freighter''{{'}}s crew, he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home, mistaking her for a pirate. After realizing what he has done, he returns to the seashore, where he finds that ''The Black Freighter'' has not come to claim the town; it has come to claim him. He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship. According to Richard Reynolds, the mariner is \"forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another.\" Just like Adrian Veidt, he \"hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal\".<ref>Reynolds, p. 111</ref> Moore stated that the story of ''The Black Freighter'' ends up specifically describing \"the story of Adrian Veidt\" and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story, such as Rorschach's capture and Dr. Manhattan's self-exile on Mars.<ref name=\"Blather Moore Interview 3\" />\n\n===Symbols and imagery===\nMoore named [[William S. Burroughs]] as one of his main influences during the conception of ''Watchmen''. He admired Burroughs' use of \"repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning\" in Burroughs' only comic strip, \"[[Ah Pook Is Here|The Unspeakable Mr. Hart]]\", which appeared in the British underground magazine ''Cyclops''. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that \"there's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read\", while other \"things [...] turned up in there by accident.\"<ref name=\"strange\" />\n\n[[File:Galle crater.gif|left|thumb|The [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]] from the planet Mars appears in ''Watchmen'' as an example of the series' recurring [[smiley]] motif]]\nA stained [[Smiley|smiley face]] is a recurring image in the story, appearing in many forms. In ''The System of Comics'', Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces \"rhyme and remarkable configurations\" by appearing in key segments of ''Watchmen'', notably the first and last pages of the series\u2014spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a \"recurrent geometric motif\" and due to its symbolic connotations.<ref>Groensteen, p. 152, 155</ref> Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to \"lighten\" the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as \"a symbol for the whole series\",<ref name=\"Artists80\" /> noting its resemblance to the [[Doomsday Clock]] ticking up to midnight.<ref name=illustrating/> Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of [[behaviorism]], explaining that the tests had presented the face as \"a symbol of complete innocence\". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that on \"the little plugs on the spark hydrants if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face\".<ref name=\"strange\" />\n\nOther symbols, images, and allusions that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that \"[t]he whole thing with ''Watchmen'' has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/> Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic,<ref name=\"Comics Bulletin\" /> citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship.<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> In a book of the [[Impact crater|craters]] and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]], which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, \"We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic\", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the \"[[Gordian Knot]] Lock Company\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/>\n\n==Themes==\nThe initial premise of the series was to examine what superheroes would be like \"in a credible, real world\". As the story became more complex, Moore said ''Watchmen'' became about \"power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society.\"<ref name=\"Craft\">{{cite web | title = The Craft: An Interview with Alan Moore | url = http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm | publisher = Engine Comics | date = September 9, 2002 | publication-date = 2004 | accessdate = October 14, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050217045326/http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm | archivedate = February 17, 2005}}</ref> The title of the series refers to the question \"Who will watch the watchmen themselves?\", famously posed by the [[Latin literature|Roman]] satirist [[Juvenal]] (as \"''[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]]''\"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until [[Harlan Ellison]] informed him.<ref name=plowrightp43>Plowright, Frank. \"Preview: Watchmen\".

Hemel Hempstead, May 2008]]\nBradford Wright described ''Watchmen'' as \"Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular.\"<ref name=\"Wright272\" /> Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of ''Watchmen'' were Moore's \"admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate\". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to \"the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagans]], [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatchers]], and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process\".<ref name=\"Wright273\">Wright, p. 273</ref> Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing ''Watchmen'' to be \"not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-[[Political positions of Ronald Reagan|Reaganism]]\", specifically believing that \"at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: \"There's no overt political message at all.

He considers ''Watchmen'' and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' to be \"the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature.\"<ref>Klock, p. 25\u201326</ref> He elaborates by noting that \"Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a ''[[kenosis]]'' towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world\".<ref>Klock, p. 63</ref> First and foremost, \"Moore's exploration of the [often compromised] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate\u2014to revision\u2014every superhero in terms of Moore's ''kenosis''\u2014his emptying out of the tradition\".<ref>Klock, p. 65</ref> Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself.<ref>Klock, p. 62</ref> The deconstructive nature of ''Watchmen'' is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, \"[l]ike Alan Moore's ''kenosis'', [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.{{' \"}}<ref>Klock, p. 75</ref>\n\nMoore has expressed dismay that \"[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by ''Watchmen'' [...] became a genre\". He said in 2003 that \"to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since ''Watchmen'', an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use ''Watchmen'' to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them\".<ref>Robinson, Tasha. \"[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22543 Interviews: Alan Moore]\".

Speaking at the 1985 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Moore said: \"The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we can make all the money from the [[Slurpee]] cups.\"<ref name=\"TCJ106\" /> For ''Watchmen'', Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings.<ref name=\"strange\" /> Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when \"DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them \"a substantial amount of money\" to retain the rights. Moore added, \"So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nMoore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for ''Watchmen'' and his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' series with artist [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]].

Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because ''[[The 'Nam]]'' was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a \"Nite Owl/Rorschach team\" (in the manner of ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'').

It was published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986 and 1987, and collected in a single volume edition in 1987. ''Watchmen'' originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring [[superhero]] characters that the company had acquired from [[Charlton Comics]]. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor [[Dick Giordano]] convinced Moore to create original characters instead.\n\nMoore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. ''Watchmen'' depicts an [[alternate history]] where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate break-in]] was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward [[World War III]] with the [[Soviet Union]], freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and [[Moral ambiguity|moral struggles]] of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.\n\nCreatively, the focus of ''Watchmen'' is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained [[smiley|smiley face]]. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a [[nonlinear narrative]], the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, [[coincidence]] and repeated imagery.\n\nA commercial success, ''Watchmen'' has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. ''Watchmen'' was recognized in ''Time''{{'}}s [[Time's List of the 100 Best Novels|List of the 100 Best Novels]] as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the [[BBC]]'s Nicholas Barber<!-- writer redlinked at [[Nicholas Barber]] \"who worked with Nick Percival\"? --> described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160809-watchmen-the-moment-comic-books-grew-up|title=Watchmen: The moment comic books grew up|last=Barber|first=Nicholas|date=August 9, 2016|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' was released in 2009.

The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The [[point of divergence]] occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"Wright271\">Wright, p. 271</ref> In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of ''Watchmen'' are commonly called \"superheroes\", only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities.<ref name=\"Wright272\">Wright, p. 272</ref> The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the [[Watergate scandal]] not coming to pass. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] occurs approximately six years later than in real life.\n\nWhen the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the [[Soviet Union]], which has dramatically increased [[Cold War]] tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] continues to operate outside the law.<ref name=\"Reynolds106\">Reynolds, p. 106</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn October 1985, New York City detectives are investigating the murder of Edward Blake. With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Rorschach deduces Blake to have been the true identity of The Comedian, a costumed hero employed by the U.S. government, after finding his costume and signature smiley-face pin badge. Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades: Daniel Dreiberg (an inventor and formerly the second Nite Owl), the superpowered and emotionally detached Jon Osterman (codenamed Doctor Manhattan) and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk (the second Silk Spectre), and Adrian Veidt (once the hero [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], and now a successful businessman).\nDreiberg, Veidt, and Manhattan attend Blake's funeral, where Dreiberg tosses Blake\u2019s pin badge in his coffin before he is buried. Manhattan is later accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As the U.S. depends on Manhattan as a strategic military asset, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviets invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt. Rorschach himself is framed for murdering a former supervillain named Moloch. Though he attempted to flee from the authorities, Rorschach is ultimately captured and unmasked as Walter Kovacs. \n\nNeglected in her relationship with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings, and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg. They begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's [[conspiracy theory]], the pair takes it upon themselves to break him out of prison. After looking back on his own personal history, Manhattan places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother (the original Silk Spectre), was, in fact, her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.\n\nOn Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy and find evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, in which he has been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to ''New Frontiersman'', a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war by faking an alien invasion in New York, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the superpowers against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent. They say that they will stop him, but Veidt reveals that he already enacted his plan before they arrived.\n\nWhen Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, they are confronted by mass destruction and death in New York, with a gigantic squid-like [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|creature]], created by Veidt's laboratories, dead in the middle of the city. Manhattan notices his [[Precognition|prescient]] abilities are limited by [[tachyon]]s emanating from the Antarctic and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing the truth is in the best interests of world peace. Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan who argues at this point, the truth can only hurt. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks him if he did the right thing in the end. Manhattan cryptically responds that \"nothing ever ends\" before leaving Earth. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance.\n\nBack in New York, the editor at ''New Frontiersman'' asks his assistant to find some filler material from the \"crank file\", a collection of rejected submissions to the paper, many of which have not been reviewed yet. The series ends with the young man reaching toward the pile of discarded submissions, near the top of which is Rorschach's journal.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Watchmen characters}}\n[[File:Watchmencharacters.jpg|thumb|upright|The main characters of ''Watchmen'' (from left to right): Ozymandias, the second Silk Spectre, Doctor Manhattan, The Comedian (kneeling), the second Nite Owl, and Rorschach]]\n\nWith ''Watchmen'', Alan Moore's intention was to create four or five \"radically opposing ways\" to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible.

However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a \"kind of a quantum super-hero\" than he could have with Captain Atom.<ref name=\"cba\" /> In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into [[nuclear physics]] and [[quantum physics]] in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain \"human habits\" and to grow away from them and humanity in general.<ref name=\"strange\" /> Gibbons had created the blue character [[Rogue Trooper]] and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles white skin tonally, but has a different hue.

Of Polish heritage, she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years.

Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation [[Mr. A]];<ref name=\"S&S116\" /> Ditko's Charlton character [[Question (comics)|The Question]] also served as a template for creating Rorschach.<ref name=\"cba\" /> Comics historian Bradford W.

In a 1986 interview, Moore said, \"What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating\", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that ''Watchmen'' was designed to be read \"four or five times\", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings.<ref name=\"strange\" /> Dave Gibbons notes that, \"[a]s it progressed, ''Watchmen'' became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a [[macguffin]], a [[gimmick]] ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn't the most interesting thing about ''Watchmen''. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in.\"<ref name=\"Salisbury\">Salisbury, p. 82</ref>\n\nGibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of ''Watchmen'' so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and \"not some other comic book\".<ref name=\"Artists77\">Salisbury, p. 77</ref> He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different from that commonly seen in comics.<ref name=\"Artists77\" /> The artist tried to draw the series with \"a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin\" which he hoped \"would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line\".<ref name=\"Artists80\">Salisbury, p. 80</ref> In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former [[Surveying|surveyor]] for \"including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing\".<ref>Rogers, Adam. \"[https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/17-03/ff_moore_qa?currentPage=5 Legendary Comics Writer Alan Moore on Superheroes, The League, and Making Magic].\" Wired.com.

Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nColorist John Higgins used a template that was \"moodier\" and favored secondary colors.<ref name=\"EW article 3\" /> Moore stated that he had also \"always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an [[airbrush]] colorist\", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color ''Watchmen'' in European-style flat color.

The whole of the issue's layout was intended to be symmetrical, culminating in this center spread, where the pages reflect one another. Art by Dave Gibbons]]\n\nStructurally, certain aspects of ''Watchmen'' deviated from the norm in comic books at the time, particularly the panel layout and the coloring. Instead of panels of various sizes, the creators divided each page into a nine-panel grid.<ref name=\"EW article 3\" /> Gibbons favored the nine-panel grid system due to its \"authority\".<ref name=\"Artists80\" /> Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which \"gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn't had previously\", according to Gibbons. \"There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect.\"<ref name=\"Salisbury\"/> [[Bhob Stewart]] of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' mentioned to Gibbons in 1987, that the page layouts recalled those of [[EC Comics]], in addition to the art itself, which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of [[John Severin]].<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC-style layouts \"was a very deliberate thing\", although his inspiration was rather [[Harvey Kurtzman]],<ref name=\"Comics Bulletin\"/> but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look.<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> The artist also cited Steve Ditko's work on early issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as an influence,<ref>Salisbury, p. 77\u201380</ref> as well as ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', where \"even at his most psychedelic [he] would still keep a pretty straight page layout\".<ref name=illustrating/>\n\nThe cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story. Gibbons said, \"The cover of the ''Watchmen'' is in the real world and looks quite real, but it's starting to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present.<ref name=\"strange\" /> The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled \"Fearful Symmetry\", so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the following pages mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nThe end of each issue, with the exception of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various ''Watchmen'' characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of ''Watchmen'', which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory.<ref name=\"CBR Amaya 2008\" /> Moore said, \"By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\n===''Tales of the Black Freighter''===\n{{for|the direct-to-video supplement to the comic book's film adaptation|Watchmen (film)#Home media}}\n\n''Watchmen'' features a [[story within a story]] in the form of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic's story, \"Marooned\", is read by a youth in New York City.<ref name=\"Reynolds\"/> Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of ''Watchmen'' experience superheroes in real life, \"they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics.\"<ref name=\"Blather Moore Interview 3\">Kavanagh, Barry. \"[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/watchmen3.html The Alan Moore Interview: Watchmen, microcosms and details]\".

Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent\u2014with EC riding the crest of the wave.\" Moore felt \"the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of ''Watchmen''\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/> The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presence in the story would add [[subtext]] and allegory.<ref>Salisbury, p. 80\u201382</ref> The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' at the end of issue five credits real-life artist [[Joe Orlando]] as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the ''Watchmen'' universe that DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.<ref name=\"S&S116\"/>\n\nIn \"Marooned\", a young mariner (called \"The Sea Captain\") journeys to warn his hometown of the coming of ''The Black Freighter'', after he survives the destruction of his own ship. He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft. When he finally returns home, believing it to be already under the occupation of ''The Black Freighter''{{'}}s crew, he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home, mistaking her for a pirate. After realizing what he has done, he returns to the seashore, where he finds that ''The Black Freighter'' has not come to claim the town; it has come to claim him. He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship. According to Richard Reynolds, the mariner is \"forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another.\" Just like Adrian Veidt, he \"hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal\".<ref>Reynolds, p. 111</ref> Moore stated that the story of ''The Black Freighter'' ends up specifically describing \"the story of Adrian Veidt\" and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story, such as Rorschach's capture and Dr. Manhattan's self-exile on Mars.<ref name=\"Blather Moore Interview 3\" />\n\n===Symbols and imagery===\nMoore named [[William S. Burroughs]] as one of his main influences during the conception of ''Watchmen''. He admired Burroughs' use of \"repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning\" in Burroughs' only comic strip, \"[[Ah Pook Is Here|The Unspeakable Mr. Hart]]\", which appeared in the British underground magazine ''Cyclops''. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that \"there's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read\", while other \"things [...] turned up in there by accident.\"<ref name=\"strange\" />\n\n[[File:Galle crater.gif|left|thumb|The [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]] from the planet Mars appears in ''Watchmen'' as an example of the series' recurring [[smiley]] motif]]\nA stained [[Smiley|smiley face]] is a recurring image in the story, appearing in many forms. In ''The System of Comics'', Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces \"rhyme and remarkable configurations\" by appearing in key segments of ''Watchmen'', notably the first and last pages of the series\u2014spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a \"recurrent geometric motif\" and due to its symbolic connotations.<ref>Groensteen, p. 152, 155</ref> Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to \"lighten\" the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as \"a symbol for the whole series\",<ref name=\"Artists80\" /> noting its resemblance to the [[Doomsday Clock]] ticking up to midnight.<ref name=illustrating/> Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of [[behaviorism]], explaining that the tests had presented the face as \"a symbol of complete innocence\". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that on \"the little plugs on the spark hydrants if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face\".<ref name=\"strange\" />\n\nOther symbols, images, and allusions that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that \"[t]he whole thing with ''Watchmen'' has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/> Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic,<ref name=\"Comics Bulletin\" /> citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship.<ref name=\"Pebbles116\"/> In a book of the [[Impact crater|craters]] and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]], which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, \"We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic\", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the \"[[Gordian Knot]] Lock Company\".<ref name=\"S&S116\"/>\n\n==Themes==\nThe initial premise of the series was to examine what superheroes would be like \"in a credible, real world\". As the story became more complex, Moore said ''Watchmen'' became about \"power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society.\"<ref name=\"Craft\">{{cite web | title = The Craft: An Interview with Alan Moore | url = http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm | publisher = Engine Comics | date = September 9, 2002 | publication-date = 2004 | accessdate = October 14, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050217045326/http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm | archivedate = February 17, 2005}}</ref> The title of the series refers to the question \"Who will watch the watchmen themselves?\", famously posed by the [[Latin literature|Roman]] satirist [[Juvenal]] (as \"''[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]]''\"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until [[Harlan Ellison]] informed him.<ref name=plowrightp43>Plowright, Frank. \"Preview: Watchmen\".

Hemel Hempstead, May 2008]]\nBradford Wright described ''Watchmen'' as \"Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular.\"<ref name=\"Wright272\" /> Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of ''Watchmen'' were Moore's \"admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate\". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to \"the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagans]], [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatchers]], and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process\".<ref name=\"Wright273\">Wright, p. 273</ref> Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing ''Watchmen'' to be \"not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-[[Political positions of Ronald Reagan|Reaganism]]\", specifically believing that \"at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: \"There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...].\"<ref name=plowrightp54>Plowright, p. 54</ref> While Moore wanted to write about \"power politics\" and the \"worrying\" times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would \"switch off\" if he attacked a leader they admired.<ref name=\"EW article 2\" /> Moore stated in 1986 that he \"was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nCiting ''Watchmen'' as the point where the comic book medium \"came of age\", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay \"Deconstructing the Hero\" that the story accomplished this by \"developing its heroes precisely in order to ''deconstruct'' the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground\".<ref>Thomson, p. 101</ref> Thomson stated that the heroes in ''Watchmen'' almost all share a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook \"as the simple, unvarnished truth\" to \"deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality\".<ref>Thomson, p. 108</ref> He wrote that the story \"develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes\".<ref>Thomson, p. 109</ref> Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept \"suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed\", which he feels distinguishes \"this postmodern work\" from the deconstructions of the hero in the [[existentialism]] movement.<ref>Thomson, p. 111</ref> Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of ''Watchmen'' are forced to confront \"more intangible social and moral concerns\", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre.<ref>Reynolds, p. 115</ref> Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre \"all mark out ''Watchmen'' either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre\".<ref>Reynolds, p. 117</ref>\n\nGeoff Klock eschewed the term \"deconstruction\" in favor of describing ''Watchmen'' as a \"revisionary superhero narrative\". He considers ''Watchmen'' and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' to be \"the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature.\"<ref>Klock, p. 25\u201326</ref> He elaborates by noting that \"Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a ''[[kenosis]]'' towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world\".<ref>Klock, p. 63</ref> First and foremost, \"Moore's exploration of the [often compromised] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate\u2014to revision\u2014every superhero in terms of Moore's ''kenosis''\u2014his emptying out of the tradition\".<ref>Klock, p. 65</ref> Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself.<ref>Klock, p. 62</ref> The deconstructive nature of ''Watchmen'' is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, \"[l]ike Alan Moore's ''kenosis'', [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.{{' \"}}<ref>Klock, p. 75</ref>\n\nMoore has expressed dismay that \"[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by ''Watchmen'' [...] became a genre\". He said in 2003 that \"to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since ''Watchmen'', an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use ''Watchmen'' to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them\".<ref>Robinson, Tasha. \"[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22543 Interviews: Alan Moore]\".

The [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was a commercial success, and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor [[Marvel Comics]] in the comic book direct market.<ref name=\"Wright273\" /> The series' publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six editor Len Wein believed were necessary.

Along with [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 1986 ''[[The Dark Knight Returns|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' miniseries, ''Watchmen'' was marketed as a \"[[graphic novel]]\", a term that allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels and dissociated them from comics.<ref>Sabin, p. 165</ref> As a result of the publicity given to the books like the ''Watchmen'' trade in 1987, bookstores and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them.

Speaking at the 1985 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Moore said: \"The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we can make all the money from the [[Slurpee]] cups.\"<ref name=\"TCJ106\" /> For ''Watchmen'', Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings.<ref name=\"strange\" /> Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when \"DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/> Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them \"a substantial amount of money\" to retain the rights. Moore added, \"So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with.\"<ref name=\"TCJ116\"/>\n\nMoore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for ''Watchmen'' and his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' series with artist [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]]. Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print.

Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because ''[[The 'Nam]]'' was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a \"Nite Owl/Rorschach team\" (in the manner of ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'').
