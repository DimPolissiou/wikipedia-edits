Mr Zechariach Pollock Head of the Education Planning Unit of the Ministry of Education Headed the initiative, supported by consultant Dr. Hilroy Thomas, and assisted by Miss Avril Warner and Dr. Helen Francis Seaman who formed College redevelopment committee.

In [[Pakistan]], ruling Generals [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] (1977\u20131988) and [[Pervez Musharraf]] (1999\u20132008) have held [[referendums]] to elect themselves [[President of Pakistan]] for additional terms forbidden by the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]].\n==Justification==\nIn the past, military juntas have justified their rule as a way of bringing political stability for the nation or rescuing it from the threat of \"dangerous ideologies\". For example, the threat of [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[Islamism]] was often used. Military regimes tend to portray themselves as non-partisan, as a \"neutral\" party that can provide interim leadership in times of turmoil, and also tend to portray civilian politicians as corrupt and ineffective. One of the almost universal characteristics of a military government is the institution of [[martial law]] or a permanent [[state of emergency]].\n\nA military dictatorship is different from [[civilian dictatorship]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \"neutral\" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] adopt titles such as \"Committee of National Restoration\", or \"National Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of themselves as a head.<ref name=\"Cheibub_etal_2010\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2|issn=0048-5829|volume=143|issue=1\u20132|pages=67\u2013101|last=Cheibub|first=Jos\u00e9 Antonio|author2=Jennifer Gandhi|author3=James Raymond Vreeland|title=Democracy and dictatorship revisited|journal=Public Choice|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n==Current cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In [[Pakistan]], ruling Generals [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] (1977\u20131988) and [[Pervez Musharraf]] (1999\u20132008) have held [[referendums]] to elect themselves [[President of Pakistan]] for additional terms forbidden by the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]].\n==Justification==\nIn the past, military juntas have justified their rule as a way of bringing political stability for the nation or rescuing it from the threat of \"dangerous ideologies\". For example, the threat of [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[Islamism]] was often used. Military regimes tend to portray themselves as non-partisan, as a \"neutral\" party that can provide interim leadership in times of turmoil, and also tend to portray civilian politicians as corrupt and ineffective. One of the almost universal characteristics of a military government is the institution of [[martial law]] or a permanent [[state of emergency]].\n\nA military dictatorship is different from [[civilian dictatorship]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \"neutral\" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] adopt titles such as \"Committee of National Restoration\", or \"National Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of themselves as a head.<ref name=\"Cheibub_etal_2010\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2|issn=0048-5829|volume=143|issue=1\u20132|pages=67\u2013101|last=Cheibub|first=Jos\u00e9 Antonio|author2=Jennifer Gandhi|author3=James Raymond Vreeland|title=Democracy and dictatorship revisited|journal=Public Choice|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n==Current cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its founding fathers were Imam Bardjo, Soedarto, Dan Sulaiman and Soesanto Kartoatmodjo.\n\nInitially called Semarang University, the institution was renamed Diponegoro University in 1960 after it was granted state university accreditation by the Indonesian government. The name \"[[Diponegoro]]\" is taken from the Indonesian patriot who fought against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[colonialism]] in the early 19th century.\n\nDuring the year 2000 UNDIP expanded its engineering and research capabilities on its Tembalang campus.
