In 2006, he signed for Clonmany Shamrocks senior side of the [[Inishowen Football League]], and was successful during his first spell in junior football.

He was then assigned the no. 7 jersey for the 2009 campaign, with manager James Gallagher using McLaughlin right across the midfield and front-line.He took his inspiration in football from his neighbour DJ Mcgeoghegan who in turn took his inspiration from local car dealer Liam. Unfortunately Stephan\u2019s dear friend DJ Mcgeoghegan\u2019s promising career in football was cut short when friend and recent rising clonmany shamrocks star Brendan \u201cLackin\u201d Doherty gave him a trimming after going with old girlfriend Foxy\n\n===Derry City===\nHe signed for [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] after the 2010 season, after impressing in games against Derry at both [[Finn Park]] and the [[Brandywell]].

The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]].

The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start.

Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|\"Fab Five\"]] edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n* '''1999\u201300''' Cincinnati was the nation's top team and [[Kenyon Martin]] was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight [[Conference USA]] regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA Tournament]].

The Bearcats were upset in the 2nd round to 8-seed UCLA in a double-overtime thriller.\n* '''2011\u201312''' After starting the season 5\u20133 with bad losses and dealing with the aftermath and suspensions from the [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|Crosstown Shootout brawl]], UC's season was already on the brinks halfway through December. The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in [[Mick Cronin (basketball coach)|Mick Cronin]]'s coaching career. \n* '''2017\u201318''' Cincinnati began the season with high hopes, featuring a team hallmarked by four \"1000 point career scorers\" ([[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]], [[Jacob Evans]], Kyle Washington, and [[Cane Broome]]). They spent the entire season in the national polls, peaking at #5 - this was fueled by their defensive prowess which ranked second overall nationally. They earned their first outright American Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and tied the school record for wins, going 31\u20135. Their season ended with a second round NCAA tournament upset to Nevada who tied the record for the 2nd largest NCAA Tournament comeback- surmounting a 22-point deficit to win by 2.\n\n==Notable games==\n'''01/09/1958 \u2013 Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54''': 19-year-old sophomore [[Oscar Robertson]] (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win.

They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's [[Bobby Knight]] sent the game into overtime, tied at 61. Cincy, led by [[Paul Hogue]] and [[Bob Wiesenhahn]], took it from there, winning, 70\u201365, giving the Bearcats their first basketball title in school history.\n\n'''03/24/1962 \u2013 Cincinnati 71, Ohio State 59''': Cincinnati and Ohio State, again ranked Nos. 1 and 2 at the end of the regular season, became the first teams to play each other in two consecutive NCAA championship games. Unlike the year before, this game was not close. Cincy led by eight at the half and won by 12 as Paul Hogue and [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] led the way with 22 and 21 points, respectively. When it was over, the Bearcats' second-year coach [[Ed Jucker]] had a pair of NCAA titles in two tries.\n\n'''03/23/1963 \u2013 Loyola (Ill.) 60, Cincinnati 58''': Despite its No. 3 ranking and a scoring average of 91.8, nobody expected Loyola of Chicago to beat Cincinnati,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} especially when the Ramblers fell behind by 15 in the second half. But Loyola rallied to send the game into OT and won the title on a last-second rebound and basket by [[Vic Rouse (basketball)|Vic Rouse]].\n\n'''3/13/1976 \u2013 Notre Dame 79, Cincinnati 78''': Facing No. 7 Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament, the No. 15 Bearcats had led the entire game and were inbounding under the Irish basket with eight seconds left.

The arena is on-campus and has a capacity of 12,012 (with room for overflow). It is located in the Myrl H. Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based [[Fifth Third Bank]]. It is still popularly known as \"The Shoe\". The Bearcats closed out Fifth Third Arena (pre-2018 renovation) with an all-time home record of 389\u201379 ({{Winning percentage|389|79}}), along with an active 26-game home winning streak. The Bearcats held a 42-game win streak from 1997\u20132000 as well. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also will feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.  During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment.

[[University of Cincinnati]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17th against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]].<ref>https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/01/05/cincinnati-mick-cronin-health</ref> Assistant Coach, [[Larry Davis (basketball)|Larry Davis]] took the reigns and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 seasons Cincinnati won the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]]. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as [[Sean Kilpatrick]], [[Troy Caupain]], [[Jacob Evans]], and [[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]]. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated [[Ohio State]] in overtime, 70\u201365.\n* '''1961\u201362''' Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat [[Bradley]] in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging [[UCLA]], 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. [[Paul Hogue]] was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n* '''1962\u201363''' UC breezed to its fifth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over [[Oregon]] in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|\"Fab Five\"]] edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n* '''1999\u201300''' Cincinnati was the nation's top team and [[Kenyon Martin]] was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight [[Conference USA]] regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA Tournament]]. Martin was a unanimous first team [[All-American]] with Pete Mickeal earning honorable mention honors. Cincinnati went from the #1 team in the country to a 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament, and fell to [[Tulsa]] in the 2nd round.\n* '''2001\u201302''' Unranked in the major polls at the start of the season, the Bearcats posted a 31\u20134 record\u2014setting a new standard for victories\u2014won a seventh consecutive Conference USA regular season championship, captured the C-USA tournament crown and earned their first-ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. [[Steve Logan]] earned his second straight Conference USA Player of the Year award, was a consensus All-American and a finalist for every national player of the year honor. The Bearcats were upset in the 2nd round to 8-seed UCLA in a double-overtime thriller.\n* '''2011\u201312''' After starting the season 5\u20133 with bad losses and dealing with the aftermath and suspensions from the [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|Crosstown Shootout brawl]], UC's season was already on the brinks halfway through December. The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in [[Mick Cronin (basketball coach)|Mick Cronin]]'s coaching career. \n* '''2017\u201318''' Cincinnati began the season with high hopes, featuring a team hallmarked by four \"1000 point career scorers\" ([[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]], [[Jacob Evans]], Kyle Washington, and [[Cane Broome]]). They spent the entire season in the national polls, peaking at #5 - this was fueled by their defensive prowess which ranked second overall nationally. They earned their first outright American Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and tied the school record for wins, going 31\u20135. Their season ended with a second round NCAA tournament upset to Nevada who tied the record for the 2nd largest NCAA Tournament comeback- surmounting a 22-point deficit to win by 2.\n\n==Notable games==\n'''01/09/1958 \u2013 Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54''': 19-year-old sophomore [[Oscar Robertson]] (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win. His 56 points, at the time, was a [[Madison Square Garden]] record.\n\n'''03/25/1961 \u2013 Cincinnati 70, Ohio State 65''': The Buckeyes were the defending champs, 27\u20130 and No. 1 in the nation. They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's [[Bobby Knight]] sent the game into overtime, tied at 61. Cincy, led by [[Paul Hogue]] and [[Bob Wiesenhahn]], took it from there, winning, 70\u201365, giving the Bearcats their first basketball title in school history.\n\n'''03/24/1962 \u2013 Cincinnati 71, Ohio State 59''': Cincinnati and Ohio State, again ranked Nos. 1 and 2 at the end of the regular season, became the first teams to play each other in two consecutive NCAA championship games. Unlike the year before, this game was not close. Cincy led by eight at the half and won by 12 as Paul Hogue and [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] led the way with 22 and 21 points, respectively. When it was over, the Bearcats' second-year coach [[Ed Jucker]] had a pair of NCAA titles in two tries.\n\n'''03/23/1963 \u2013 Loyola (Ill.) 60, Cincinnati 58''': Despite its No. 3 ranking and a scoring average of 91.8, nobody expected Loyola of Chicago to beat Cincinnati,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} especially when the Ramblers fell behind by 15 in the second half.

It was an ugly, very low-scoring affair, where UAB led at halftime 15\u201311. In a tie game with seconds left, [[Corie Blount]] for UC had his shot blocked. It was kicked around and [[Nick Van Exel]] recovered it to put up a long two-pointer at the buzzer. Nothing but net.

He was fouled, but hit all three free throws with no time on the clock. UC won, 81\u201380, and Durden's 45 points were the most by a Bearcat in 34 years.\n\n'''03/12/1995 \u2013 Cincinnati 67, St. Louis 65''': LaZelle Durden fired in the game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds to play in the conference championship game over Saint Louis, giving the Bearcats a 67\u201365 victory and clinching an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\n'''02/11/1996 \u2013 Arizona, 79, Cincinnati 76''': The Bearcats had the ball under their own hoop in a tie game vs Arizona with just a few seconds left.

The majority of the Bearcats bench stormed the court in excitement, thinking the game was over. Cincinnati was given a technical foul for the incident, awarding Tulane two free throws and the ball. Honeycutt only made one of two free throws, and Tulane was unable to score with 0.2 seconds left.

Levett dunked the ball with one second left, and the Bearcats won, 77\u201375.

After defeating SMU (82-74) and Wichita State (66-63) in the AAC quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, the Bearcats scored a redemptive victory. AAC Player of the year Jarron Cumberland scored 33 points and was named tournament most outstanding player as the Bearcats successfully defended their AAC Tournament Crown and delivered Houston's only double digit loss of the [[2018\u201319 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|2018-2019]] season.\n\n'''03/07/2020 - Cincinnati 64, Temple 63''': The Bearcats under new coach John Brannen endured an up and down season - epitomized by a Senior Day where they fell behind underdog Temple by as many as 14 points. Fueled by All-AAC players Jarron Cumberland and Trevon Scott, the Bearcats slowly mounted a comeback - tying the game at 54 with 2:03 left. After a hectic 2 minutes, Temple took the lead on a late 3 with 10 seconds remaining. Out of timeouts, Jarron Cumberland drove down the court but his layup ricocheted off the back iron; however, Trevon Scott heroically made a putback layup in the waning seconds to give the Bearcats a dramatic win. The win ultimately shored up the Bearcats' bubbly tournament resume, gave the Bearcats a share of the AAC regular season title, and (after the AAC conference tournament was cancelled due to [[COVID-19]]) earned them a 3rd consecutive AAC conference tournament title.\n\n==Rivalries==\n\n===Xavier===\n{{See also|Crosstown Shootout}}\n\nCincinnati's main basketball rivalry is [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]].

The arena is on-campus and has a capacity of 12,012 (with room for overflow). It is located in the Myrl H. Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based [[Fifth Third Bank]]. It is still popularly known as \"The Shoe\". The Bearcats closed out Fifth Third Arena (pre-2018 renovation) with an all-time home record of 389\u201379 ({{Winning percentage|389|79}}), along with an active 26-game home winning streak. The Bearcats held a 42-game win streak from 1997\u20132000 as well. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also will feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.  During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment.

First elected president of the [[French Second Republic]] in [[1848 French presidential election|1848]], he could have seized power in 1851, when he could possibly not constitutionally be re-elected, and possibly became the [[emperor of the French]]. He hypothetically founded the [[Second French Empire]] and was possibly its only emperor until the hypothetical defeat of the French army and his possible capture by [[Prussia]] and its allies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. He could have worked to modernize the French economy, rebuilt the center of Paris, expanded the [[French overseas empire]], and engaged in the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].\n\nNapoleon III might have commissioned a grand [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|reconstruction of Paris]] carried out by his prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]], and launched similar public works projects in [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]] and other French cities. Napoleon III might have modernized the French banking system, expanded and consolidated the French railway system, and made the French merchant marine possibly the second largest in the world. He hypothetically promoted the building of the [[Suez Canal]] and could have established modern agriculture, which might have ended famines in France and possibly made France an agricultural exporter. Napoleon III could have negotiated the 1860 [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier free trade agreement]] with Britain and similar agreements with France's other European trading partners. Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize. The first women students were possibly admitted at the Sorbonne and educational opportunities for women were increased, as did the list of required subjects in public schools.\n\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III hypothetically aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. He was possibly a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and of [[nationalism]]. In Europe, he could have allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356). His regime might have assisted [[Italian unification]] by possibly defeating the Austrian Empire in the [[Franco-Austrian War]] and later annexed [[Savoy]] and the [[County of Nice]] as its deferred reward. At the same time, his forces defended the [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.  He was also possibly favorable towards the union of the Danubian Principalities (24th of January 1859), which resulted in the hypothetical establishment of the modern state of [[Romania]]. Napoleon III might have doubled the area of the [[French overseas empire]] in Asia, the Pacific and Africa. On the other hand, the [[French intervention in Mexico]], which aimed to create a [[Second Mexican Empire]] under French protection,possibly ended in total failure.\n\nFrom 1866, Napoleon might have to face the mounting power of Prussia as its Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] sought German unification under Prussian leadership. In July 1870, Napoleon might have entered the Franco-Prussian War without allies and with inferior military forces.Perhaps The French army was rapidly defeated and Napoleon III might have been captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. The [[French Third Republic]] was proclaimed in Paris and Napoleon went into exile in England, where he died in 1873.\n\n==Childhood and family==\n\n===Early life===\nCharles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, later known as Louis Napoleon and then Napoleon III, was born in Paris on the night of 19\u201320 April 1808. His father was [[Louis Bonaparte]], the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who made Louis the [[Kingdom of Holland|King of Holland]] from 1806 until 1810. His mother was [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], the only daughter of Napoleon's wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] by her first marriage to [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]].\n\nAs empress, Jos\u00e9phine proposed the marriage as a way to produce an heir for the Emperor, who agreed, as Jos\u00e9phine was by then infertile.<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 20</ref> Louis married Hortense when he was twenty-four and she was nineteen. They had a difficult relationship and only lived together for brief periods. Their first son [[Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte]] died in 1807 and\u2014though separated and parents of a healthy second son, [[Napol\u00e9on-Louis Bonaparte]]\u2014they decided to have a third child. They resumed their marriage for a brief time in Toulouse in July 1807, and Louis was born prematurely, two weeks short of nine months. Louis Napoleon's enemies, including [[Victor Hugo]], spread the gossip that he was the child of a different man, but most historians agree today that he was the legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 21\u201324</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, p. 15</ref> (see [[Napoleon III of France#Ancestry|ancestry]]).<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 37</ref>\n\nCharles-Louis was baptized at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] on 5 November 1810, with Emperor Napoleon serving as his godfather and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Empress Marie-Louise]] as his godmother. His father stayed away, once again separated from Hortense. At the age of seven, Louis Napoleon visited his uncle at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. Napoleon held him up to the window to see the soldiers parading in the courtyard of the Carousel below. He last saw his uncle with the family at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], shortly before Napoleon departed for the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nAll members of the [[Bonaparte dynasty]] were forced into exile after the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of monarchy in France. Hortense and Louis Napoleon moved from [[Aix-les-Bains|Aix]] to [[Bern]] to [[Baden-Baden|Baden]], and finally to a lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]] in the Swiss canton of [[Thurgau]]. He received some of his education in Germany at the [[gymnasium school]] at [[Augsburg]], Bavaria. As a result, for the rest of his life, his French had a slight but noticeable German accent. His tutor at home was [[Philippe Le Bas]], an ardent republican and the son of a revolutionary and close friend of [[Robespierre]]. Le Bas taught him French history and radical politics.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 39\u201342</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|[[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the King of Holland, and father of Napoleon III\nFile:Reine de Hollande et son fils.jpg|[[Hortense de Beauharnais]] (1783\u20131837), mother to Louis Napoleon in 1808\nFile:Schloss Arenenberg mit Kapelle und Napoleonmuseum.jpg|The lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]], Switzerland, where Louis Napoleon spent much of his youth and exile\n</gallery>\n\n===Romantic revolutionary (1823\u20131835)===\nWhen Louis Napoleon was fifteen, Hortense moved to Rome, where the Bonapartes had a villa. He passed his time learning Italian, exploring the ancient ruins, and learning the arts of seduction and romantic affairs, which he used often in his later life. He became friends with the French Ambassador, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Chateaubriand]], the father of romanticism in French literature, with whom he remained in contact for many years. He was reunited with his older brother [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte|Napoleon Louis]], and together they became involved with the [[Carbonari]], secret revolutionary societies fighting Austria's domination of northern Italy. In the spring of 1831, when he was twenty-three, the Austrian and papal governments launched an offensive against the Carbonari, and the two brothers, wanted by the police, were forced to flee. During their flight, Napoleon-Louis contracted measles and, on 17 March 1831, died in his brother's arms.<ref>Bresler, 1999, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Hortense joined her son and together they evaded the police and Austrian army and finally reached the French border.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 58\u201372</ref>\n\nHortense and Louis Napoleon travelled incognito to Paris, where the old regime of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had just fallen and been replaced by the more liberal regime of King [[Louis Philippe I]]. They arrived in Paris on 23 April 1831, and took up residence under the name \"Hamilton\" in the Hotel du Holland on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. Hortense wrote an appeal to the King, asking to stay in France, and Louis Napoleon offered to volunteer as an ordinary soldier in the French Army. The new King agreed to meet secretly with Hortense; Louis Napoleon had a fever and did not join them. The King finally agreed that Hortense and Louis Napoleon could stay in Paris as long as their stay was brief and incognito. Louis-Napoleon was told that he could join the French Army if he would simply change his name, something he indignantly refused to do. Hortense and Louis Napoleon remained in Paris until 5 May, the tenth anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. The presence of Hortense and Louis Napoleon in the hotel had become known, and a public demonstration of mourning for the Emperor took place on Place Vend\u00f4me in front of their hotel. The same day, Hortense and Louis Napoleon were ordered to leave Paris. They went to Britain briefly, and then back into exile in Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\n==Early adult years==\n\n===Bonapartist succession and philosophy of Bonapartism===\nEver since the fall of Napoleon in 1815, a [[Bonapartist]] movement had existed in France,  hoping to return a Bonaparte to the throne. According to the law of succession established by Napoleon I, the claim passed first to his own son, declared \"King of Rome\" at birth by his father. This heir, known by Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was living in virtual imprisonment at the court of [[Vienna]] under the title Duke of Reichstadt. Next in line was Napoleon I's eldest brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1768\u20131844), followed by [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), but neither Joseph nor Louis had any interest in re-entering public life. When the Duke of Reichstadt died in 1832, Louis Napoleon became the ''de facto'' heir of the dynasty and the leader of the Bonapartist cause.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nIn exile with his mother in Switzerland, he enrolled in the Swiss Army, trained to become an officer, and wrote a manual of artillery (his uncle Napoleon Bonaparte had become famous as an artillery officer). Louis Napoleon also began writing about his political philosophy \u2013 for as [[H. A. L. Fisher]] suggested, \"the programme of the Empire was not the improvisation of a vulgar adventurer\" but the result of deep reflection on the Napoleonic political philosophy and on how to adjust it to the changed domestic and international scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala|title= Bonapartism, six lectures delivered in the University of London|last= Fisher|first= Herbert Albert Laurens|publisher= Clarendon Press|year= 1908|isbn= |location= Oxford|page= [https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala/page/87 87]}}</ref> He published his ''R\u00eaveries politiques'' or \"political dreams\" in 1833 at the age of 25, followed in 1834 by ''Consid\u00e9rations politiques et militaires sur la Suisse'' (\"Political and military considerations about Switzerland\"), followed in 1839 by ''Les Id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes'' (\"Napoleonic Ideas\"), a compendium of his political ideas which was published in three editions and eventually translated into six languages. He based his doctrine upon two ideas: universal suffrage and the primacy of the national interest. He called for a \"monarchy which procures the advantages of the Republic without the inconveniences\", a regime \"strong without despotism, free without anarchy, independent without conquest\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 61\u201362\n</ref>\n\n===Failed coup, and exile in London (1836\u20131840)===\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.JPG|thumb|Louis Napoleon at the time of his failed coup in 1836]]\n\"I believe,\" Louis Napoleon wrote, \"that from time to time, men are created whom I call volunteers of providence, in whose hands are placed the destiny of their countries. I believe I am one of those men. If I am wrong, I can perish uselessly. If I am right, then providence will put me into a position to fulfill my mission.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 68</ref> He had seen the popular enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte when he was in Paris, and he was convinced that, if he marched to Paris, as Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]], France would rise up and join him. He began to plan a coup against King Louis-Philippe.\n\n[[File:Soul\u00e8vement Strasbourg Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis Napoleon launching his failed coup in Strasbourg in 1836]]\nHe planned for his uprising to begin in [[Strasbourg]]. The colonel of a regiment was brought over to the cause. On 29 October 1836, Louis Napoleon arrived in Strasbourg, in the uniform of an artillery officer, and rallied the regiment to his side. The [[prefecture]] was seized, and the [[prefect]] arrested. Unfortunately for Louis-Napoleon, the general commanding the garrison escaped and called in a loyal regiment, which surrounded the mutineers. The mutineers surrendered and Louis-Napoleon fled back to Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 97\u2013100</ref>\n\n===Travel===\nKing Louis-Philippe demanded that the Swiss government return Louis Napoleon to France, but the Swiss pointed out that he was a Swiss soldier and citizen, and refused to hand him over. Louis-Philippe responded by sending an army to the Swiss border. Louis Napoleon thanked his Swiss hosts, and voluntarily left the country. The other mutineers were put on trial in [[Alsace]], and were all acquitted.\n\nLouis Napoleon traveled first to London, then to Brazil, and then to New York. He moved into a hotel, where he met the elite of New York society and the writer [[Washington Irving]]. While he was traveling to see more of the United States, he received word that his mother was very ill. He hurried as quickly as he could back to Switzerland. He reached Arenenberg in time to be with his mother on 5 October 1837, when she died. She was finally buried in [[Reuil]], in France, next to her mother, on 11 January 1838, but Louis Napoleon could not attend, because he was not allowed into France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 107\u201308</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon returned to London for a new period of exile in October 1838. He had inherited a large fortune from his mother and took a house with seventeen servants and several of his old friends and fellow conspirators. He was received by London society and met the political and scientific leaders of the day, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Michael Faraday]]. He also did considerable research into the economy of Britain. He strolled in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], which he later used as a model when he created the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n===Second coup, prison, escape and exile (1840\u20131848)===\n\nLiving in the comfort of London, he had not given up the dream of returning to France to seize power. In the summer of 1840 he bought weapons and uniforms and had proclamations printed, gathered a contingent of about sixty armed men, hired a ship called the ''Edinburgh-Castle'', and on 6 August 1840, sailed across the [[English Channel|Channel]] to the port of [[Boulogne]]. The attempted coup turned into an even greater fiasco than the Strasbourg mutiny. The mutineers were stopped by the customs agents, the soldiers of the garrison refused to join, the mutineers were surrounded on the beach, one was killed and the others arrested. Both the British and French press heaped ridicule on Louis-Napoleon and his plot. The newspaper ''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' wrote, \"this surpasses comedy. One doesn't kill crazy people, one just locks them up.\" He was put on trial, where, despite an eloquent defense of his cause, he was sentenced to life in prison in the fortress of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] department of northern France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 122\u201333</ref>\n\n===Activities===\nThe register of the fortress Ham for 7 October 1840 contained a concise description of the new prisoner: \"Age: thirty-two years. Height: one meter sixty-six. Hair and eyebrows: chestnut. Eyes: Gray and small. Nose: large. Mouth: ordinary. Beard: brown. Moustache: blond. Chin: pointed. Face: oval. Complexion: pale. Head: sunken in his shoulders, and large shoulders. Back: bent. Lips: thick.\"<ref>Quoted in S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 81</ref> He had a mistress named \u00c9l\u00e9onore Vergeot, a young woman from the nearby town, who gave birth to two of his children.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 83</ref>\n\nWhile in prison, he wrote poems, political essays, and articles on diverse topics. He contributed articles to regional newspapers and magazines in towns all over France, becoming quite well known as a writer. His most famous book was ''L'extinction du pauperisme'' (1844), a study of the causes of poverty in the French industrial working class, with proposals to eliminate it. His conclusion: \"The working class has nothing, it is necessary to give them ownership. They have no other wealth than their own labor, it is necessary to give them work that will benefit all....they are without organization and without connections, without rights and without a future; it is necessary to give them rights and a future and to raise them in their own eyes by association, education, and discipline.\" He proposed various practical ideas for creating a banking and savings system that would provide credit to the working class, and to establish agricultural colonies similar to the kibutzes later founded in Israel.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 89. Translated by D. Siefkin</ref> This book was widely reprinted and circulated in France, and played an important part in his future electoral success.\n\nHe was busy in prison, but also unhappy and impatient. He was aware that the popularity of Napoleon Bonaparte was steadily increasing in France; the Emperor was the subject of heroic poems, books and plays. Huge crowds had gathered in Paris on 15 December 1840 when the [[Retour des cendres|remains of Napoleon]] Bonaparte were returned with great ceremony to Paris and handed over to Louis Napoleon's old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, while Louis Napoleon could only read about it in prison. On 25 May 1846, with the assistance of his doctor and other friends on the outside, he disguised himself as a laborer carrying lumber, and walked out of the prison. His enemies later derisively called him \"Badinguet\", the name of the laborer whose identity he had assumed. A carriage was waiting to take him to the coast and then by boat to England. A month after his escape, his father Louis died, making Louis Napoleon the clear heir to the Bonaparte dynasty.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Return and early affairs===\nHe quickly resumed his place in British society. He lived on King Street in St James's, London, went to the theatre and hunted, renewed his acquaintance with Benjamin Disraeli, and met [[Charles Dickens]]. He went back to his studies at the British Museum. He had an affair with the actress [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]], the most famous French actress of the period, during her tours to Britain. More important for his future career, he had an affair with the wealthy heiress [[Harriet Howard]] (1823\u20131865). They met in 1846, soon after his return to Britain. They began to live together, she took in his two illegitimate children and raised them with her own son, and she provided financing for his political plans so that, when the moment came, he could return to France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte \u00e0 Boulogne (D\u00e9barquement en Ao\u00fbt 1840).JPG|Louis Napoleon's 1840 attempt to lead an uprising against Louis-Philippe ended in fiasco and ridicule.

He spoke rarely in the Assembly, but, because of his name, had enormous popularity in the country.]]\n\nIn February 1848, Louis Napoleon learned that the [[French Revolution of 1848]] had broken out, and that Louis-Philippe, faced with opposition within his government and army, had abdicated. Believing that his time had finally come, he set out for Paris on 27 February, departing England on the same day that Louis-Philippe left France for his own exile in England. When he arrived in Paris, he found that the Second Republic had been declared, led by a Provisional Government headed by a Commission led by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], and that different factions of republicans, from conservatives to those on the far left, were competing for power. He wrote to Lamartine announcing his arrival, saying that he \"was without any other ambition than that of serving my country\". Lamartine wrote back politely but firmly, asking Louis-Napoleon to leave Paris \"until the city is more calm, and not before the elections for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]\". His close advisors urged him to stay and try to take power, but he wanted to show his prudence and loyalty to the Republic; while his advisors remained in Paris, he returned to London on 2 March 1848 and watched events from there.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 102</ref>\n\nHe did not run in the first elections for the National Assembly, held in April 1848, but three members of the Bonaparte family, [[Jerome Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], [[Pierre Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and [[Prince Lucien Murat|Lucien Murat]] were elected; the name Bonaparte still had political power. In the next elections, on 4 June, where candidates could run in multiple departments, he was elected in four different departments; in Paris, he was among the top five candidates, just after the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. His followers were mostly on the left, from the peasantry and working class. His pamphlet on \"The Extinction of Pauperism\" was widely circulated in Paris, and his name was cheered with those of the socialist candidates [[Armand Barb\u00e8s|Barb\u00e8s]] and [[Louis Blanc]].<ref>'S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 105</ref>\n\nThe [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] leaders of the provisional government, Lamartine and [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac|Cavaignac]], considered arresting him as a dangerous revolutionary, but once again he outmaneuvered them. He wrote to the President of the Provisional Government: \"I believe I should wait to return to the heart of my country, so that my presence in France will not serve as a pretext to the enemies of the Republic.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn June 1848, the [[June Days Uprising]] broke out in Paris, led by the far left, against the conservative majority in the National Assembly. Hundreds of barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods. General Cavaignac, the leader of the army, first withdrew his soldiers from Paris to allow the insurgents to deploy their barricades, and then returned with overwhelming force to crush the uprising; from 24 to 26 June, there were battles in the streets of the working class districts of Paris. An estimated five thousand insurgents were killed at the barricades, fifteen thousand were arrested, and four thousand deported.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nHis absence from Paris meant that Louis Napoleon was not connected either with the uprising, or with the brutal repression that had followed. He was still in London on 17\u201318 September, when the elections for the National Assembly were held, but he was a candidate in thirteen departments. He was elected in five departments; in Paris, he received 110,000 votes of the 247,000 cast, the highest number of votes of any candidate. He returned to Paris on 24 September, and this time he took his place in the National Assembly. In seven months, he had gone from a political exile in London to a highly visible place in the National Assembly, as the government finished the [[French Constitution of 1848|new Constitution]] and prepared for the first election ever of a President of the French Republic.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 182</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1848===\n{{further|French presidential election, 1848}}\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte pr\u00e9sident.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Louis Napoleon captured 74.2 percent of votes cast in the first French direct presidential elections in 1848.]]\nThe new constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], drafted by a commission including [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], called for a strong executive and a president elected by popular vote through universal male suffrage, rather than chosen by the National Assembly.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 111</ref> The [[1848 French presidential election|elections]] were scheduled for 10\u201311 December 1848. Louis Napoleon promptly announced his candidacy. There were four other candidates for the post: General Cavaignac, who had led the suppression of the June uprisings in Paris; Lamartine, the poet-philosopher and leader of the provisional government; [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]], the leader of the socialists; and [[Raspail]], the leader of the far left wing of the socialists.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 182\u201390</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon established his campaign headquarters and residence at the Hotel du Rhin on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. He was accompanied by his companion, Harriet Howard, who gave him a large loan to help finance his campaign. He rarely went to the sessions of the National Assembly and rarely voted. He was not a gifted orator; he spoke slowly, in a monotone, with a slight German accent from his Swiss education. His opponents sometimes ridiculed him, one comparing him to \"a turkey who believes he's an eagle\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 115</ref>\n\nHis campaign appealed to both the left and right. His election manifesto proclaimed his support for \"religion, family, property, the eternal basis of all social order\". But it also announced his intent \"to give work to those unoccupied; to look out for the old age of the workers; to introduce in industrial laws those improvements which don't ruin the rich, but which bring about the well-being of each and the prosperity of all\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 125</ref>\n\nHis campaign agents, many of them veterans from Napoleon Bonaparte's army, raised support for him around the country. Louis Napoleon won the grudging endorsement of the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]], who believed he could be the most easily controlled; Thiers called him \"of all the candidates, the least bad\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 123</ref> He won the backing of ''L'Evenement'', the newspaper of Victor Hugo, which declared, \"We have confidence in him; he carries a great name.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 124</ref> His chief opponent, General Cavaignac, expected that Louis Napoleon would come in first, but that he would receive less than fifty percent of the vote, which would mean the election would go to the National Assembly, where Cavaignac was certain to win.\n\nThe elections were held on 10\u201311 December. Results were announced on 20 December. Louis Napoleon was widely expected to win, but the size of his victory surprised almost everyone. He won 5,572,834 votes, or 74.2 percent of votes cast, compared with 1,469,156 for Cavaignac. The socialist Ledru-Rollin received 376,834; the extreme left candidate Raspail 37,106, and the poet Lamartine only 17,000 votes. Louis Napoleon won the support of all segments of the population: the peasants unhappy with rising prices; unemployed workers; small businessmen who wanted prosperity and order; and intellectuals such as Victor Hugo. He won the votes of 55.6 percent of all registered voters, and won in all but four of France's departments.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 189\u201390</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Election france 1848.jpg|The 1848 presidential campaign pitted Louis Napoleon against General Cavaignac, the Minister of Defense of the Provisional Government, and the leaders of the socialists.\nFile:Extinction du Paup\u00e9risme par Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1.jpeg|Louis Napoleon's essay, \"The Extinction of Pauperism\", advocating reforms to help the working class, was widely circulated during the 1848 election campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Prince-President (1848\u20131851)===\nLouis Napoleon moved his residence to the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] at the end of December 1848 and immediately hung a portrait of his mother in the boudoir and a portrait of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, in his coronation robes, in the grand salon.

The previous government had sent an expeditionary force to Rome to help restore the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal authority]] of [[Pope Pius IX]], who was being threatened by the troops of the Italian republicans [[Mazzini]] and [[Garibaldi]]. The French troops came under fire from Garibaldi's soldiers. The Prince-President, without consulting his ministers, ordered his soldiers to fight if needed in support of the Pope. This was very popular with French Catholics, but infuriated the republicans, who supported Garibaldi.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 194\"/> To please the radical republicans, he asked the Pope to introduce liberal reforms and the ''[[Code Napoleon]]'' to the [[Papal States]]. To gain support from the Catholics, he approved the ''[[Loi Falloux]]'' in 1851, which restored a greater role for the Catholic Church in the French educational system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=Napol\u00e9on III and the Second Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqd6MdOYZkwC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=16|isbn=978-0203134245}}</ref>\n\nElections were held for the [[1849 French legislative election|National Assembly on 13\u201314 May 1849]], only a few months after Louis Napoleon had become President, and were largely won by a coalition of conservative republicans\u2014which Catholics and monarchists called \"The [[Party of Order]]\"\u2014led by Adolphe Thiers. The socialists and \"red\" republicans, led by Ledru-Rollin and Raspail, also did well, winning two hundred seats. The moderate republicans, in the middle, did very badly, taking just 70-80 seats. The Party of Order had a clear majority, enough to block any initiatives of Louis Napoleon.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 208\u201309</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 1849 the socialists and radical republicans made [[French demonstration of 15 May 1848|an attempt to seize power]]. Ledru-Rollin, from his headquarters in the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers|Conservatory of Arts and Professions]], declared that Louis Napoleon was no longer President and called for a general uprising. A few barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. Louis Napoleon acted swiftly, and the uprising was short-lived. Paris was declared in a state of siege, the headquarters of the uprising was surrounded, and the leaders arrested. Ledru-Rollin fled to England, Raspail was arrested and sent to prison, the republican clubs were closed, and their newspapers closed down.\n\nThe National Assembly, now without the left republicans and determined to keep them out forever, proposed a new election law that placed restrictions on universal male suffrage, imposing a three-year residency requirement. This new law excluded 3.5 of 9 million French voters, the voters that the leader of the Party of Order, Adolphe Thiers, scornfully called \"the vile multitude\".<ref>Cobban, p. 155</ref> This new election law was passed in May 1850 by a majority of 433 to 241, putting the National Assembly on a direct collision course with the Prince-President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald Aminzade|title=Ballots and Barricades: Class Formation and Republican Politics in France, 1830\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTbybLDLPiAC&pg=PA299|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=299|isbn=978-0691028712}}</ref> Louis Napoleon broke with the Assembly and the conservative ministers opposing his projects in favour of the dispossessed. He secured the support of the army, toured the country making populist speeches that condemned the Assembly, and presented himself as the protector of universal male suffrage. He demanded that the law be changed, but his proposal was defeated in the Assembly by a vote of 355 to 348.<ref>Cobban, p. 156</ref>\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 1848, he had to step down at the end of his term, so Louis Napoleon sought a constitutional amendment to allow him to succeed himself, arguing that four years were not enough to fully implement his political and economic program. He toured the country and gained support from many of the regional governments and many within the Assembly. The vote in July 1851 was 446 to 278 in favor of changing the law and allowing him to run again, but this was short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stevens Cabot Abbott|title=The history of Napoleon III., emperor of the French|publisher=B.B.

His half-brother Morny and a few close advisors quietly began to organize [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They brought Major General [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud]], a former captain from the [[French Foreign Legion]] and a commander of French forces in Algeria, and other officers from the French army in North Africa, to provide military backing for the coup. The date set for the coup was 2 December, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and the anniversary of the [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Louis Napoleon's uncle Napoleon I]]. On the night of 1\u20132 December, Saint Arnaud's soldiers quietly occupied the national printing office, the [[Palais Bourbon]], newspaper offices, and the strategic points in the city. In the morning, Parisians found posters around the city announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly, the restoration of universal suffrage, new elections, and a state of siege in Paris and the surrounding departments. Sixteen members of the National Assembly were arrested in their homes. When about 220 deputies of the moderate right gathered at the city hall of the [[10th arrondissement of Paris|10th arrondissement]], they were also arrested.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 255</ref> On 3 December, writer [[Victor Hugo]] and a few other republicans tried to organize an opposition to the coup. A few barricades appeared, and about 1,000 insurgents came out in the streets, but the army moved in force with 30,000 troops and the uprisings were swiftly crushed, with the killing of an estimated 300 to 400 opponents of the coup.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 261</ref> There were also small uprisings in the more militant red republican towns in the south and center of France, but these were all put down by 10 December.<ref>Cobban, pp. 157\u201358</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon followed the [[self-coup]] by a period of repression of his opponents, aimed mostly at the red republicans. About 26,000 people were arrested, including 4,000 in Paris alone. The 239 inmates who were judged most severely were sent to the penal colony in [[Cayenne]].<ref>Cobban, p. 158</ref> 9,530 followers were sent to [[French Algeria]], 1,500 were expelled from France, and another 3,000 were given forced residence away from their homes.<ref>Cobban and Milza</ref> Soon afterwards, a commission of revision freed 3,500 of those sentenced. In 1859, the remaining 1800 prisoners and exiles were amnestied, with the exception of the republican leader Ledru-Rollin, who was released from prison but required to leave the country.<ref>Cobban, p 158</ref>\n\nStrict press censorship was enacted by a decree from 17 February 1852. No newspaper dealing with political or social questions could be published without the permission of the government, fines were increased, and the list of press offenses was expanded. After three warnings, a newspaper or journal could be suspended or even permanently closed.<ref>Cobban, p. 159</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon wished to demonstrate that his new government had a broad popular mandate, so [[1851 French constitutional referendum|on 20\u201321 December a national plebiscite]] was held asking if voters agreed to the coup. Mayors in many regions threatened to publish the names of any electors who refused to vote. When asked if they agreed to the coup, 7,439,216 voters said yes, 641,737 voted no, and 1.7 million voters abstained.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 271</ref> The fairness and legality of the [[referendum]] was immediately questioned by Louis Napoleon's critics,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Edward Berenson|author2=Vincent Duclert|author3=Christophe Prochasson|title=The French Republic: History, Values, Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_eDj7dNMfwC&pg=PA34|year=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0801461125}}</ref> but Louis Napoleon was convinced that he had been given a public mandate to rule.\n\nHugo, who had originally supported Louis Napoleon but had been infuriated by the coup d'\u00e9tat, departed Paris for Brussels by train on 11 December 1851.

Work began on [[French Constitution of 1852|the new document]] in 1852. It was officially prepared by a committee of eighty experts, but was actually drafted by a small group of the Prince-President's inner circle. Under the new constitution, Louis-Napoleon was automatically reelected as president. Under Article Two, the president could now serve an unlimited number of 10-year terms. He alone was given the authority to declare war, sign treaties, form alliances and initiate laws. The Constitution re-established universal male [[suffrage]], and also retained a National Assembly, but with reduced authority.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 277</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon's government imposed new authoritarian measures to control dissent and reduce the power of the opposition. One of his first acts was to settle scores with his old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, who had sent him to prison for life, and who had died in 1850. A decree on 23 January 1852 forbade the late King's family to own property in France and annulled the inheritance he had given to his children before he became King.\n\nThe National Guard, whose members had sometimes joined anti-government demonstrations, was re-organized and largely used only in parades. Government officials were required to wear uniforms at official formal occasions. The Minister of Education was given the power to dismiss professors at the universities and review the content of their courses. Students at the universities were forbidden to wear beards, seen as a symbol of republicanism.<ref name=\"Milsa, Pierre pg. 279\">Milza, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince-President of the Republic, 1852.jpg|thumb|Photographic portrait of Louis Napoleon (1852) by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nAn election was held for a new National Assembly on 29 February 1852, and all the resources of the government were used on behalf of the candidates backing the Prince-President. Of eight million eligible voters, 5,200,000 votes went to the official candidates and 800,000 to opposition candidates. About one third of the eligible voters abstained. The new Assembly included a small number of opponents of Louis Napoleon, including 17 monarchists, 18 conservatives, two liberal democrats, three republicans and 72 independents.<ref>Milsa, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\nDespite now holding all governing power in the nation, Louis Napoleon was not content with being an authoritarian president. The ink had barely dried on the new, severely authoritarian constitution when he set about making himself emperor. Following the election, the Prince-President went on a triumphal national tour. In Marseille, he laid the cornerstone of a new cathedral, a new stock exchange, and a chamber of commerce. In Bordeaux, on 9 October 1852, he gave his principal speech:\n:Some people say the Empire is war. I say the Empire is peace. Like the Emperor I have many conquests to make\u2026 Like him I wish \u2026 to draw into the stream of the great popular river those hostile side-currents which lose themselves without profit to anyone.

We have, in front of Marseille, a vast kingdom to assimilate into France. We have all the great ports of the west to connect with the American continent by modern communications, which we still lack. We have ruins to repair, false gods to tear down, truths which we need to make triumph. This is how I see the Empire, if the Empire is re-established. These are the conquests I am considering, and you around me, who, like me, want the good of our country, you are my soldiers.\"<ref>Speech of 9 October in Bordeaux, published in ''Le Moniteur''.

During his reign, the railway network of France expanded from 3&nbsp;500 kilometers to 20&nbsp;000 kilometers.]]\n[[File:Printemps haussmann1.JPG|thumb|Among the commercial innovations encouraged by Napoleon III were the first department stores. [[Bon March\u00e9]] opened in 1852, followed by Au Printemps in 1865.]]\n\nOne of the first priorities of Napoleon III was the modernization of the French economy, which had fallen far behind that of the United Kingdom and some of the German states. Political economics had long been a passion of the Emperor. While in Britain, he had visited factories and railway yards, and in prison, he had studied and written about the sugar industry and policies to reduce poverty. He wanted the government to play an active, not a passive, role in the economy. In 1839, he had written: \"Government is not a necessary evil, as some people claim; it is instead the benevolent motor for the whole social organism.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 468</ref> He did not advocate the government getting directly involved in industry. Instead, the government took a very active role in building the infrastructure for economic growth; stimulating the stock market and investment banks to provide credit; building railways, ports, canals and roads; and providing training and education. He also opened up French markets to foreign goods, such as railway tracks from England, forcing French industry to become more efficient and more competitive.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 467\u201369</ref>\n\nThe period was favorable for industrial expansion. The gold rushes in [[California Gold Rush|California]] and [[Victorian gold rush|Australia]] increased the European money supply. In the early years of the Empire, the economy also benefited from the coming of age of those born during the baby boom of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] period.<ref>{{harvnb|Plessis|1989|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> The steady rise of prices caused by the increase of the money supply encouraged company promotion and investment of capital.\n\nBeginning in 1852, Napoleon III encouraged the creation of new banks, such as [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]], which sold shares to the public and provided loans to both private industry and to the government. [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] was founded in 1863 and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in 1864. These banks provided the funding for Napoleon III's major projects, from railway and canals to the rebuilding of Paris.\n\nIn 1851, France had only 3,500 kilometers of railway, compared with 10,000 kilometers in England and 800 kilometers in [[Belgium]], a country one-twentieth the size of France. Within days of the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851, Napoleon III's Minister of Public Works launched a project to build a railway line around Paris, connecting the different independent lines coming into Paris from around the country. The government provided guarantees for loans to build new lines and urged railway companies to consolidate. There were 18 railway companies in 1848 and six at the end of the Empire. By 1870, France had 20,000 kilometers of railway linked to the French ports and to the railway systems of the neighbouring countries that carried over 100 million passengers a year and transported the products of France's new steel mills, mines and factories.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 471\u201374</ref>\n\n====Development of steamships and early reconstruction on Paris====\n[[File:Travaux nocturnes des constructions de la rue de Rivoli, \u00e9clair\u00e9s par la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique.jpg|thumb|Enormous public works projects reconstructed the center of Paris. Here, work to extend the Rue de Rivoli continues at night by electric light (1854).]]\n\nNew shipping lines were created and ports rebuilt in [[Marseille]] and [[Le Havre]], which connected France by sea to the US, Latin America, North Africa and the Far East. During the Empire, the number of steamships tripled, and by 1870, France possessed the second-largest maritime fleet in the world after England.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 475</ref> Napoleon III backed the greatest maritime project of the age, the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] between 1859 and 1869. The canal project was funded by shares on the [[Paris Bourse|Paris stock market]] and led by a former French diplomat, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. It was opened by the Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie]] with a performance of [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]].''<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 474</ref>\n\nThe rebuilding of central Paris also encouraged commercial expansion and innovation. The first department store, [[Bon March\u00e9]], opened in Paris in 1852 in a modest building and expanded rapidly, its income increasing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Its founder, [[Aristide Boucicaut]], commissioned a new glass and iron building designed by [[Louis-Charles Boileau]] and [[Gustave Eiffel]] that opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern [[department store]]. Other department stores quickly appeared: [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865 and [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 486</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's program also included reclaiming farmland and reforestation. One such project in the [[Gironde|Gironde department]] drained and reforested 10,000 square kilometers (3,900 square miles) of moorland, creating the [[Landes forest]], the largest maritime pine forest in Europe.\n\n===Reconstruction of Paris (1854\u20131870)===\n{{Main|Haussmann's renovation of Paris}}\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Avenue de l'Opera - Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts Reims.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra]], one of the new boulevards created by Napoleon III. The new buildings on the boulevards were required to be all of the same height and same basic facade design, and all faced with cream coloured stone, giving the city center its distinctive harmony.]]\nNapoleon III began his regime by launching a series of enormous public works projects in Paris, hiring tens of thousands of workers to improve the sanitation, water supply and traffic circulation of the city. To direct this task, he named a new prefect of the [[Seine department]], [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], and gave him extraordinary powers to rebuild the center of the city. He installed a large map of Paris in a central position in his office, and he and Haussmann planned the new Paris.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with neither an increase in its area nor a development of its structure of very narrow medieval streets and alleys.\n\nTo accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the center by the construction of new boulevards and squares, Napoleon III issued a decree in 1860 to [[Municipal annexation|annex]] eleven [[Communes of France|communes]] (municipalities) on the outskirts of Paris and increase the number of [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]] (city boroughs) from twelve to twenty. Paris was thus enlarged to its modern boundaries with the exception of the two major city parks ([[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]]) that only became part of the French capital in 1920.\n\nFor the duration of Napoleon III's reign and a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an enormous construction site. His hydraulic chief engineer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand]], built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the [[Vanne (river)|Vanne River]] in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne region]], and a new huge reservoir near the future [[Parc Montsouris]]. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic meters of water a day.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'' p. 21</ref> Hundreds of kilometers of pipes distributed the water throughout the city, and a second network, using the less-clean water from the [[Ourcq]] and the [[Seine]], washed the streets and watered the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the [[Paris sewers]] and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new [[streetlight]]s along the Paris streets.<ref>Milza, 2006</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1854, in the center of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and constructed new avenues to connect the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height, constructed in a architectural similar style, and be faced with cream-coloured stone to create the signature look of Paris boulevards.\n\nNapoleon III built two new railway stations: the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1855) and the [[Gare du Nord]] (1865). He completed [[Les Halles]], the great cast iron and glass pavilioned produce market in the center of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]], in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the [[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]. The signature architectural landmark was the [[Paris Opera]], the largest theater in the world, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] to crown the center of Napoleon III's new Paris.<ref>Ayers, Andrew (2004). ''The Architecture of Paris''. Stuttgart; London: Edition Axel Menges. {{ISBN|978-3-930698-96-7}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\">Jarrasse, Dominique (2007), ''Grammaire des jardins parisiens'', Parigramme</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially [[Hyde Park (London)|Hyde Park]], where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile; but he wanted to build on a much larger scale. Working with Haussmann and [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the engineer who headed the new Service of Promenades and Plantations, he laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city. Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds and trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III transformed the [[Bois de Boulogne]] into a park (1852\u201358) to the west of Paris. To the east, he created the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1860\u201365), and to the north, the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] (1865\u201367). The [[Parc Montsouris]] (1865\u201378) was created to the south.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to building the four large parks, Napoleon had the city's older parks, including the [[Parc Monceau]], formerly owned by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans family]], and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], refurbished and replanted. He also created some twenty small parks and gardens in the neighbourhoods as miniature versions of his large parks. Alphand termed these small parks \"green and flowering salons\". The intention of Napoleon's plan was to have one park in each of the eighty \"quartiers\" (neighbourhoods) of Paris, so that no one was more than a ten-minute walk from such a park. The parks were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.<ref>Jarrasse, Dominque (2007), Grammmaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme. p. 134</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adolphe Yvon - Haussmann pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'Empereur le plan d'annexion des Communes.jpg|[[Baron Haussmann]] and Napoleon III make official the annexation of eleven communes around Paris to the City.

The architect, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], described the style simply as \"Napoleon the Third\".\nFile:Bois de Boulogne.jpeg|The [[Bois de Boulogne]], transformed by Napoleon III between 1852 and 1858, was designed to give a place for relaxation and recreation to all the classes of Paris.\n</gallery>\n\n===Search for a wife===\n[[File:Imperatrice Eug\u00e9nie - Winterhalter - 1853.jpg|thumb|Empress Eug\u00e9nie in 1853, after her marriage to Napoleon III (by Franz Xaver Winterhalter)]]\n\nSoon after becoming emperor, Napoleon III began searching for a wife to give him an heir. He was still attached to his companion [[Harriet Howard]], who attended receptions at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] and traveled around France with him. He quietly sent a diplomatic delegation to approach the family of Princess [[Carola of Vasa]], the granddaughter of deposed King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]]. They declined because of his Catholic religion and the political uncertainty about his future, as did the family of [[Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], a niece of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nLouis-Napoleon finally announced that he found the right woman: a Spaniard called [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie du Derje de Montijo]], age 23, 20th [[Count of Teba|Countess of Teba]] and 15th Marchioness of [[Ardales]]. She received much of her education in Paris. Her beauty attracted Louis-Napoleon, who, as was his custom, tried to seduce her, but Eug\u00e9nie told him to wait for marriage. The civil ceremony took place at [[Tuileries Palace]] on 22 January 1853, and a much grander ceremony was held a few days later at the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In 1856, Eug\u00e9nie gave birth to a son and heir-apparent, [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 199\u2013204</ref>\n\n[[File:Empress Eugenie with her son 1862.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e9nie and the Prince Imperial in 1862]]\n\nWith an heir to the throne secured, Napoleon III resumed his \"petites distractions\" with other women. Eug\u00e9nie faithfully performed the duties of an empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the Emperor to balls, opera, and theater. She traveled to Egypt to open the [[Suez Canal]] and officially represented him whenever he traveled outside France.\n\nThough a fervent Catholic and conservative on many other issues, she strongly advocated equality for women. She pressured the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]] to give the first [[baccalaur\u00e9at|baccalaureate]] diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] to elect the writer [[George Sand]] as its first female member.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 204\u201310</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy (1852\u20131860)==\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world as a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>John B.

French troops assisted [[Italian unification]] by fighting on the side of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In return, France received [[Savoy]] and the county of [[Nice]] in 1860. Later, however, to appease fervent French Catholics, he sent soldiers to defend the residual [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 285884|title = The Good Napoleon III|journal = French Historical Studies|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 308\u2013329|last1 = Spitzer|first1 = Alan B.|year = 1962|doi = 10.2307/285884}}</ref><ref>Lynn Case, ''French opinion on war and diplomacy during the Second Empire'' (1954).</ref>\n\n===Principle of Nationalities===\n[[File:Abd-EL-Kader-And-Napoleon-III.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III and [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]], the Algerian military leader who led a struggle against the [[French conquest of Algeria|French invasion of Algeria]]]]\n\nIn a speech at Bordeaux shortly after becoming Emperor, Napoleon III proclaimed that \"The Empire means peace\" (\"''L'Empire, c'est la paix''\"), reassuring foreign governments that he would not attack other European powers in order to extend the French Empire. He was, however, determined to follow a strong foreign policy to extend France's influence and warned that he would not stand by and allow another European power to threaten its neighbour.\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, he was also an advocate of a new \"principle of nationalities\" (''principe des nationalit\u00e9s'') that supported the creation of new states [[nation-state|based on nationality]], such as Italy, in place of the old multinational empires, such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (or [[Empire of Austria]], known since 1867 as [[Austria-Hungary]]). In this he was influenced by his uncle's policy as described in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne''. In all of his foreign policy ventures, he put the interests of France first. Napoleon III felt that new states created on the basis of national identity would become natural allies and partners of France.<ref>Roger Price, ''The French Second Empire: an anatomy of political power'' (2001) p. 43</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Britain and the Crimean War (1853\u20131856)===\n{{Main|Crimean War}}\n[[File:William Simpson - Attack on the Malakoff.jpg|thumb|The French capture of Russian positions around [[Sevastopol]] brought the end of the [[Crimean War]].]]\n\n[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] as Britain's foreign minister and prime minister had close personal ties with leading French statesmen, notably Napoleon III himself.

[[John Thadeus Delane|John Delane]], editor of ''[[The Times]]'', visited France in January 1853 and was impressed by its military preparedness. He expressed his conviction that \"Louis-Napoleon was resolved on a forward foreign policy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/palmerstons-follies-a-reply-to-the-french-threat/|title='Palmerston's Follies': a reply to the French 'threat'|last=Hicks|first=Peter|date=2016|website=NAPOLEON.org \u2013 The History Website of the Fondation Napoleon|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Napoleon III was actually determined to increase the country\u2019s naval power. The first purpose-built steam-powered battleship (worryingly christened after [[French battleship Napol\u00e9on|Napoleon I]]) was launched in 1850, and the fortification of [[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] was strengthened. This led to the extension of the breakwater of [[Alderney]] and the construction of [[Fort Clonque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423|title=Fort Clonque Alderney, Channel Islands|date=2018|website=The Landmark Trust|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start of his Empire, Napoleon III sought an alliance with Britain. He had lived there while in exile and saw Britain as a natural partner in the projects he wished to accomplish. An opportunity soon presented itself: In early 1853, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] put pressure on the weak [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] government, demanding that the [[Ottoman Empire]] give Russia a protectorate over the Christian countries of the [[Balkans]] as well as control over [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]]. The Ottoman Empire, backed by Britain and France, refused Russia's demands, and a joint British-French fleet was sent to support the Ottoman Empire. When Russia refused to leave the [[Romania|Romanian territories]] it had occupied, Britain and France declared war on 27 March 1854.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\">Milza, 2006, pp. 382\u201386</ref>\n\nIt took France and Britain six months to organize a full-scale military expedition to the [[Black Sea]]. The Anglo-French fleet landed thirty thousand French and twenty thousand British soldiers in the [[Crimea]] on 14 September and began to [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)|lay siege]] to the major Russian port of [[Sevastopol]]. As the siege dragged on, the French and British armies were reinforced and troops from the Kingdom of Sardinia joined them, reaching a total of 140,000 soldiers, but they suffered terribly from epidemics of [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], and [[cholera]]. During the 332 days of the siege, the French lost 95,000 soldiers, including 75,000 due to disease. The suffering of the army in the Crimea was carefully concealed from the French public by press censorship.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 388\u201389</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtine de Malakoff, 8 septembre 1855 par Adolphe Yvon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Malakoff]], 8 September 1855]]\nThe death of Tsar Nicholas I on 2 March 1855 and his replacement by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] changed the political equation. In September, after a massive bombardment, the Anglo-French army of fifty thousand men stormed the Russian positions, and the Russians were forced to evacuate Sevastopol. Alexander II sought a political solution, and negotiations were held in Paris in the new building of the French Foreign Ministry on the [[Quai d'Orsay]], from 25 February to 8 April 1856.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\"/>\n\nThe Crimean War added three new place names to Paris: [[Pont de l'Alma|Alma]], named for the first French victory on the river of that name; [[Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol|Sevastopol]]; and [[Malakoff]], named for a tower in the center of the Russian line [[Battle of Malakoff|captured by the French]]. The war had two important diplomatic consequences: Alexander II became an ally of France, and Britain and France were reconciled. In April 1855, Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie went to England and were received by the Queen; in turn, Victoria and Prince Albert visited Paris. Victoria was the first British monarch to do so in centuries.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 392\u201395</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Russia and the alliance with Britain gave France increased authority and prestige in Europe. This was the first war between European powers since the close of the Napoleonic Wars and the [[Congress of Vienna]], marking a breakdown of the alliance system that had maintained peace for nearly half a century. The war also effectively ended the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]], or \"Waterloo Coalition,\" that the other four powers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain) had established. The [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Conference of 1856]] represented a high-water mark for Napoleon's regime in foreign affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=199}}</ref> It encouraged Napoleon III to make an even bolder foreign policy venture in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

A group of conspirators threw three bombs at the royal carriage as it made its way to the opera. Eight members of the escort and bystanders were killed and over one hundred people injured. The culprits were quickly arrested. The leader was an Italian nationalist, [[Felice Orsini]], who was aided by a French surgeon [[Simon Fran\u00e7ois Bernard|Simon Bernard]]. They believed that if Napoleon III were killed, a republican revolt would immediately follow in France, and the new republican government would help all Italian states win independence from Austria and achieve national unification. Bernard was in London at the time. Since he was a political exile, the British government refused to extradite him, but Orsini was tried, convicted and executed on 13 March 1858. The bombing focused the attention of France, and particularly of Napoleon III, on the issue of Italian nationalism.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 407\u201312</ref>\n\nPart of Italy, particularly the kingdom of [[Piedmont]]-[[Sardinia]] (officially the \"Kingdom of Sardinia\"), was independent, but central Italy was still ruled by the Pope (in this era, [[Pope Pius IX and Italy|Pope Pius IX]]), while [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy]] and much of the north was [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|ruled by Austria]]. Other states were [[de jure]] independent (e.g. the [[Duchy of Parma]] or the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]) but [[de facto]] totally under Austrian influence. Napoleon III had fought with the Italian patriots against the Austrians when he was young, and his sympathy was with them, but the Empress, most of his government and the Catholic Church in France supported the Pope and the existing governments. The British Government was also hostile to the idea of promoting nationalism in Italy. Despite the opposition in his government and in his own palace, Napoleon III did all that he could to support the cause of Piedmont-Sardinia. The King of Piedmont-Sardinia, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], was invited to Paris in November 1855, and given the same royal treatment as Queen Victoria.\n\n[[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Count Cavour]], the Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, came to Paris with the King and employed an unusual emissary in his efforts to win the support of Napoleon III: his beautiful young cousin, [[Virginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione]] (1837\u201399). As Cavour had hoped, she caught his eye and became his mistress. Between 1855 and 1857, she used the opportunity to pass messages and to plead the Italian cause.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 357\u201362</ref>\n\nIn July 1858, Napoleon arranged a secret visit by Count Cavour. They agreed to join forces and drive the Austrians from Italy. In exchange, Napoleon III asked for Savoy (the ancestral land of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia) and the then bilingual county of Nice, which had been taken from France after Napoleon's fall in 1815 and given to Piedmont-Sardinia. Cavour protested that Nice was Italian, but Napoleon responded that \"these are secondary questions. There will be time later to discuss them.\"<ref>cited in Milza, 2006, p. 414</ref>\n\nAssured of the support of Napoleon III, Count Cavour began to prepare the army of Piedmont-Sardinia for war against Austria. Napoleon III looked for diplomatic support. He approached [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and the British Government; Britain was against the war, but agreed to remain neutral. Still facing strong opposition within his own government, Napoleon III offered to negotiate a diplomatic solution with the twenty-eight-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] in the spring of 1858. The Austrians demanded the disarmament of Piedmont-Sardinia first, and sent a fleet with thirty thousand soldiers to reinforce their garrisons in Italy. Napoleon III responded on 26 January 1859 by signing a treaty of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia. Napoleon promised to send two hundred thousand soldiers to help one hundred thousand soldiers from Piedmont-Sardinia to force the Austrians out of northern Italy; in return, France would receive the county of Nice and Savoy provided that their populations would agree in a referendum.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 415\u201320</ref>\n\nIt was the Emperor Franz Joseph, growing impatient, who finally unleashed the war. On 23 April 1859, he sent an ultimatum to the government of Piedmont-Sardinia demanding that they stop their military preparations and disband their army. On 26 April, Count Cavour rejected the demands, and on 27 April, the Austrian army invaded Piedmont.\n\n====War in Italy \u2013 Magenta and Solferino (1859)====\n[[File:Yvon Bataille de Solferino Compiegne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Napoleon III with the French forces at the [[Battle of Solferino]], which secured the Austrian withdrawal from Italy. He was horrified by the casualties, and ended the war soon after the battle.]]\n\nNapoleon III, though he had very little military experience, decided to lead the French army in Italy himself. Part of the French army crossed over the Alps, while the other part, with the Emperor, landed in [[Genoa]] on 18 May 1859. Fortunately for Napoleon and the Piedmontese, the commander of the Austrians, General Giulay, was not very aggressive. His forces greatly outnumbered the Piedmontese army at Turin, but he hesitated, allowing the French and Piedmontese to unite their forces.\n\nNapoleon III wisely left the fighting to his professional generals. The first great battle of the war, on 4 June 1859, [[Battle of Magenta|was fought]] at the town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]]. It was long and bloody, and the French center was exhausted and nearly broken, but the battle was finally won by a timely attack on the Austrian flank by the soldiers of General MacMahon. The Austrians had seven thousand men killed and five thousand captured, while the French forces had four thousand men killed. The battle was largely remembered because, soon after it was fought, patriotic chemists in France gave the name of the battle to their newly discovered bright purple chemical dye; the dye and the colour took the name [[magenta]].<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 425</ref>\n\nThe rest of the Austrian army was able to escape while Napoleon III and King Victor Emmanuel made a triumphal entry on 10 June into the city of [[Milan]], previously ruled by the Austrians. They were greeted by huge, jubilant crowds waving Italian and French flags.\n\nThe Austrians had been driven from Lombardy, but the army of General Giulay remained in the region of Venice. His army had been reinforced and numbered 130,000 men, roughly the same as the French and Piedmontese, though the Austrians were superior in artillery. On 24 June, the [[Battle of Solferino|second and decisive battle]] was fought at [[Solferino]]. This battle was even longer and bloodier than Magenta. In confused and often ill-directed fighting, there were approximately forty thousand casualties, including 11,500 French. Napoleon III was horrified by the thousands of dead and wounded on the battlefield. He proposed an armistice to the Austrians, which was accepted on 8 July. A formal treaty ending the war was signed on 11 July 1859.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 427\u201328</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVoSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Armistice+of+Villafranca#v=onepage&q=Armistice%20of%20Villafranca&f=false|title=Italy in the Age of the Risorgimento 1790\u20131870|last=Hearder|first=Harry|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317872061|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCount Cavour and the Piedmontese were bitterly disappointed by the abrupt end of the war. Lombardy had been freed, but [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Venetia]] (the Venice region) was still controlled by the Austrians, and the Pope was still the ruler of Rome and Central Italy. Cavour angrily resigned his post. Napoleon III returned to Paris on 17 July, and a huge parade and celebration were held on 14 August, in front of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me column]], the symbol of the glory of Napoleon I. Napoleon III celebrated the day by granting a general amnesty to the political prisoners and exiles he had chased from France.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 431</ref>\n\nIn Italy, even without the French army, the process of Italian unification launched by Cavour and Napoleon III took on a momentum of its own. There were uprisings in central Italy and the Papal states, and Italian patriots, led by Garibaldi, [[Expedition of the Thousand|invaded and took over]] Sicily, which would lead to the collapse of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Napoleon III wrote to the Pope and suggested that he \"make the sacrifice of your provinces in revolt and confide them to Victor Emmanuel\". The Pope, furious, declared in a public address that Napoleon III was a \"liar and a cheat\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 260</ref> Rome and the surrounding [[Latium]] region remained in Papal hands, and therefore did not immediately become the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Italy, and Venetia was still occupied by the Austrians, but the rest of Italy had come under the rule of Victor Emmanuel.\n\nAs Cavour had promised, Savoy and the county of Nice were annexed by France in 1860 after referendums, although it is disputed how fair they were. In Nice, 25,734 voted for union with France, just 260 against, but Italians still called for its return into the 20th century. On 18 February 1861, the first Italian parliament met in Turin, and on 23 March, Victor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of Italy. Count Cavour died a few weeks later, declaring that \"Italy is made.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 434\u201341</ref>\n\nNapoleon's support for the Italian patriots and his confrontation with Pope Pius IX over who would govern Rome made him unpopular with fervent French Catholics, and even with Empress Eug\u00e9nie, who was a fervent Catholic. To win over the French Catholics and his wife, he agreed to guarantee that Rome would remain under the Pope and independent from the rest of Italy, and agreed to keep French troops there. The capital of Italy became Turin (in 1861) then Florence (in 1865), not Rome. However, in 1862, Garibaldi gathered an army to march on Rome, under the slogan, \"Rome or death\".{{sfn|Briggs|Clavin|2003|page=97}} To avoid a confrontation between Garibaldi and the French soldiers, the Italian government [[Battle of Aspromonte|sent its own soldiers]] to face them, arrested Garibaldi and put him in prison. Napoleon III sought, but was unable to find, a diplomatic solution that would allow him to withdraw French troops from Rome while guaranteeing that the city would remain under Papal control.\n[[File:CousinMontaubanCampaignOf1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Cousin-Montauban, Comte de Palikao|Cousin-Montauban]] leading French forces during the [[Second Opium War|Anglo-French expedition to China]]]]\n\nGaribaldi made another attempt to capture Rome in November 1867, but was defeated by the French and Papal troops near the town of [[Mentana]] on 3 November 1867.\n\nThe garrison of eight thousand French troops remained in Rome until August 1870, when they were recalled at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In September 1870, Garibaldi's soldiers finally entered Rome and made it the capital of Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 325\u201328</ref>\n\nAfter the successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and the annexation of Savoy and Nice to the territory of France, the Continental foreign policy of Napoleon III entered a calmer period. Expeditions to distant corners of the world and the expansion of the Empire replaced major changes in the map of Europe. The Emperor's health declined; he gained weight, he began to dye his hair to cover the gray, he walked slowly because of [[gout]], and in 1864, at the military camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne]], he suffered the first medical crisis from his [[gallstones]], the ailment that killed him nine years later. He was less engaged in governing and less attentive to detail, but still sought opportunities to increase French commerce and prestige globally.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 309\u201310</ref>\n\n===Overseas empire===\n{{main|French colonial empire#Napoleon III: 1852\u20131870}}\n\n====Establishing a Mexican empire====\n[[File:Arrival of Marshal Randon in Algier-Ernest-Francis Vacherot mg 5120.jpg|thumb|Arrival of Marshal [[Jacques Louis Randon|Randon]] in [[Algiers]] in 1857]]\n\nIn 1862, Napoleon III [[French intervention in Mexico|sent troops]] to Mexico in an effort to establish an allied monarchy in the Americas, with Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] enthroned as [[Emperor of Mexico|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]]. The [[Second Mexican Empire]] faced resistance from the republican government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], however. After victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States made clear that France would have to leave. It sent 50,000 troops under General [[Philip H. Sheridan]] to the U.S.-Mexico border and helped resupply Ju\u00e1rez. Napoleon's military was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew his troops from Mexico in 1866. Maximilian was overthrown and executed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Don H.

The palace was given that name because the neighbourhood in which it had been built in 1564 was previously known for its numerous mason and tiler businesses.\n\nNapoleon III's bedroom was decorated with a talisman from [[Charlemagne]] (a symbol of good luck for the Bonaparte family), while his office featured a portrait of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Ingres]] and a large map of Paris that he used to show his ideas for the reconstruction of Paris to his prefect of the Seine department, [[Baron Haussmann]]. The Emperor's rooms were overheated and were filled with smoke, as he smoked cigarette after cigarette. The Empress occupied a suite of rooms just above his, highly decorated in the style of Louis XVI with a pink salon, a green salon and a blue salon.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 200\u201301</ref>\n\nThe court moved with the Emperor and Empress from palace to palace each year following a regular calendar. At the beginning of May, the Emperor and court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]] for outdoor activities in the park. In June and July, they moved with selected guests to the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] for walks in the forest and boating on the lake. In July, the court moved to thermal baths for a health cure, first to [[Plombi\u00e8res]], then to [[Vichy]], and then, after 1856, to the military camp and residence built at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] (nowadays: Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne), where Napoleon could take the waters and review military parades and exercises. Beginning in 1856, the Emperor and Empress spent each September in [[Biarritz]] in the [[Villa Eug\u00e9nie]], a large villa overlooking the sea.<ref>[http://thegrandhotelsoftheworld.com/palais/ \"History of the Hotel du Palais, the former Villa Eugenie\"]. Grand Hotels of the World.com</ref> They would walk on the beach or travel to the mountains, and in the evenings they would dance and sing and play cards and take part in other games and amateur theatricals and charades with their guests. In November, the court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] for forest excursions, dancing and more games. Famous scientists and artists, such as [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and Giuseppe [[Verdi]], were invited to participate in the festivities at Compi\u00e8gne.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 202\u201304</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year the Emperor and Court returned to the Tuileries Palace and gave a series of formal receptions and three or four grand balls with six hundred guests early in the new year. Visiting dignitaries and monarchs were frequently invited. During [[Carnival]], there were a series of very elaborate costume balls on the themes of different countries and different historical periods, for which guests sometimes spent small fortunes on their costumes.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{main|Napoleon III style|Paris during the Second Empire}}\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|When [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and other [[avant-garde]] paintings were rejected by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1863, Napoleon III ordered that the works be displayed, so that the public could judge for themselves.]]\n\nNapoleon III had conservative and traditional taste in art: his favourite painters were [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], who received major commissions, and whose work was purchased for state museums. At the same time, he followed public opinion, and he made an important contribution to the French [[avant-garde]]. In 1863, the jury of the [[Paris Salon]], the famous annual showcase of French painting, headed by the ultra-conservative director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Count  [[\u00c9milien de Nieuwerkerke]], refused all submissions by avant-garde artists, including those by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The artists and their friends complained, and the complaints reached Napoleon III. His office issued a statement: \"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\"<ref>Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863.

More than a thousand visitors a day came to see now-famous paintings such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. '<ref>Meneglier, Herv\u00e9, ''Paris Imp\u00e9rial \u2013 la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire''</ref> The journalist [[\u00c9mile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galeries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter and mocking comments of many of the spectators.

He restored the [[fl\u00e8che]], or spire, of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], which had been partially destroyed and desecrated during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1855, he completed the restoration, begun in 1845, of the stained glass windows of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], and in 1862, he declared it a national historical monument. In 1853, he approved and provided funding for Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]]. He also sponsored Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], In 1862, he closed the prison which had occupied the Abbey of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] since the French Revolution, where many important political prisoners had been held, so it could be restored and opened to the public.\n\n==Social and economic policies==\n\n===Social policy and reforms===\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Napoleon III launched a series of social reforms aimed at improving the life of the working class. He began with small projects, such as opening up two clinics in Paris for sick and injured workers, a program of legal assistance to those unable to afford it, and subsidies to companies that built low-cost housing for their workers. He outlawed the practice of employers taking possession of or making comments in the work document that every employee was required to carry; negative comments meant that workers were unable to get other jobs. In 1866, he encouraged the creation of a state insurance fund to help workers or peasants who became disabled, and to help their widows and families.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 314</ref>\n\nTo help the working class, Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could develop an inexpensive substitute for butter; the prize was won by the French chemist [[Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s]], who in 1869 patented a product he named oleomargarine, later shortened simply to [[margarine]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 313</ref>\n\n====Rights to strike and organize (1864\u20131866)====\n\nHis most important social reform was the 1864 law that gave French workers the right to strike, which had been forbidden since 1810. In 1866, he added to this an \"Edict of Tolerance,\" which gave factory workers the right to organize. He issued a decree regulating the treatment of apprentices, limited working hours on Sundays and holidays, and removed from the [[Napoleonic Code]] the infamous article 1781, which said that the declaration of the employer, even without proof, would be given more weight by the court than the word of the employee.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 314\u201317</ref>\n\n====Education for girls and women, and school reform (1861\u20131869)====\n[[File:J.V Daubi\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In 1861, through the direct intervention of the Emperor and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, [[Julie-Victoire Daubi\u00e9]] became the first woman to receive a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma.]]\n\nNapoleon III and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie worked to give girls and women greater access to public education.

Duruy accelerated the pace of the reforms, often coming into conflict with the Catholic church, which wanted the leading role in education. Despite the opposition of the church, Duruy opened schools for girls in each commune with more than five hundred residents, a total of eight hundred new schools.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\">Milza, 2006, p. 592</ref>\n\n[[File:Victorduruy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Victor Duruy]], Napol\u00e9on III's Minister of Public Education from 1863 to 1869, created schools for girls in every commune of France and women were admitted for the first time to medical school and to the [[Sorbonne]].]]\nBetween 1863 and 1869, Duruy created scholastic libraries for fifteen thousand schools and required that primary schools offer courses in history and geography. Secondary schools began to teach philosophy, which had been banned by the previous regime at the request of the Catholic church. For the first time, public schools in France began to teach contemporary history, modern languages, art, gymnastics and music. The results of the school reforms were dramatic: in 1852, over 40 percent of army conscripts in France were unable to read or write, yet by 1869, the number had dropped to 25 percent. The rate of illiteracy among both girls and boys dropped to 32 percent.\n<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\"/>\n\nAt the university level, Napoleon III founded new faculties in [[Marseille]], [[Douai]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]] and [[Poitiers]] and founded a network of research institutes of higher studies in the sciences, history, and economics. These also were criticized by the Catholic Church. The Cardinal-Archbishop of Rouen, [[Henri-Marie-Gaston Boisnormand de Bonnechose|Monseigneur Bonnechose]], wrote, \"True science is religious, while false science, on the other hand, is vain and prideful; being unable to explain God, it rebels against him.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 598</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\n\n====Lower tariffs and the opening of French markets (1860)====\nOne of the centerpieces of the economic policy of Napoleon III was the lowering of tariffs and the opening of French markets to imported goods. He had been in Britain in 1846 when Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] had lowered tariffs on imported grains, and he had seen the benefits to British consumers and the British economy. However, he faced bitter opposition from many French industrialists and farmers, who feared British competition. Convinced he was right, he sent his chief economic advisor, [[Michel Chevalier]], to London to begin discussions, and secretly negotiated a [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|new commercial agreement]] with Britain, calling for the gradual lowering of tariffs in both countries. He signed the treaty, without consulting with the Assembly, on 23 January 1860. Four hundred of the top industrialists in France came to Paris to protest, but he refused to yield. Industrial tariffs on such products as steel rails for railways were lowered first; tariffs on grains were not lowered until June 1861. Similar agreements were negotiated with the Netherlands, Italy, and France's other neighbors. France's industries were forced to modernize and become more efficient to compete with the British, as Napoleon III had intended. Commerce between the countries surged.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 241\u201343</ref>\n\n====Economic expansion and social change====\nBy the 1860s, the huge state investment in railways, infrastructure and fiscal policies of Napoleon III had brought dramatic changes to the French economy and French society. French people travelled in greater numbers, more often and farther than they had ever travelled before. The opening of the first public school libraries by Napoleon III and the opening by [[Louis Hachette]] of the first bookstores in Napoleon's new train stations led to the wider circulation of books around France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 304</ref>\n\nDuring the Empire, industrial production increased by 73 percent, growing twice as rapidly as that of the United Kingdom, though its total output remained lower. From 1850 to 1857, the French economy grew at a pace of five percent a year and exports grew by sixty percent between 1855 and 1869.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 306\u201307</ref>\n\nFrench agricultural production increased by sixty percent, spurred by new farming techniques taught at the agricultural schools started in each [[Departments of France|Department]] by Napoleon III, and new markets opened by the railways. The threat of famine, which for centuries had haunted the French countryside, receded. The last recorded famine in France was in 1855.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\"/>\n\nDuring the Empire, the migration of the rural population to the cities increased. The portion of the population active in agriculture dropped from 61 percent in 1851 to 54 percent in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 309</ref>\n\nThe average salary of French workers grew by 45 percent during the Second Empire, but only kept up with price inflation. On the other hand, more French people than ever were able to save money; the number of bank accounts grew from 742,889 in 1852 to 2,079,141 in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\"/>\n\n====Growing opposition and liberal concessions (1860\u20131870)====\nDespite the economic progress the country had made, domestic opposition to Napoleon III was slowly growing, particularly in the ''[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]]'' (Parliament). The republicans on the left had always opposed him, believing he had usurped power and suppressed the Republic. The conservative Catholics were increasingly unhappy, because he had abandoned the Pope in his struggle to retain political control of the Papal States and had built up a public education system that was a rival to the Catholic system. Many businessmen, particularly in the metallurgical and textile industries, were unhappy, because he had reduced the tariffs on British products, putting the British products in direct competition with their own. The members of Parliament were particularly unhappy with him for dealing with them only when he needed money. When he had liberalized trade with England, he had not even consulted them.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 345\u201346</ref>\n\nNapoleon's large-scale program of public works, and his expensive foreign policy, had created rapidly mounting government debts; the annual deficit was about 100 million gold-francs, and the cumulative debt had reached nearly 1,000 million gold-francs (1 billion in US readings). The Emperor needed to restore the confidence of the business world and to involve the legislature and have them share responsibility.\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 002.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III in 1865]]\n[[File:Ten centimes 1855.JPG|thumb|Ten [[centime]] coin, 1855]]\nOn 24 December 1861, Napoleon III, against the opposition of his own ministers, issued a decree announcing that the legislature would have greater powers. The Senate and the Assembly could, for the first time, give a response to the Emperor's program, ministers were obliged to defend their programs before the Assembly, and the right of [[Deputy (France)|Deputies]] to amend the programs was enlarged. On 1 February 1861, further reforms were announced: Deputies could speak from the tribune, not just from their seats, and a stenographic record would be made and published of each session. Another even more important reform was announced on 31 December 1861: the budget of each ministry would be voted section by section, not in a block, and the government could no longer spend money by special decree when the legislature was not in session. He did retain the right to change the budget estimates section by section.\n\nThe Deputies quickly took advantage of their new rights; the Emperor's Italian policy was bitterly condemned in Parliament, and anti-government amendments by the pro-Catholic deputies were defeated by votes of 158 to 91 in the ''Corps l\u00e9gislatif'' and 79 to 61 in the Senate.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 346\u201347</ref>\n\nIn the legislative elections of 31 May 1863, the pro-government candidates received 5,308,000 votes, while the opposition received 1,954,000 votes, three times more than in the previous elections. The rural departments still voted for Napoleon III's candidates, but in Paris, 63 percent of the votes went to anti-government republican candidates, with similar numbers in all the large cities. The new Assembly contained a large opposition block ranging from Catholics outraged by the Papal policies to [[Legitimists]], [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s, [[protectionism|protectionists]] and republicans, armed with new powers given to them by the Emperor himself.<ref>Alain Plessis, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Empire, 1852\u20131871'' (1988)</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 568\u201369</ref>\n\nDespite the opposition in the legislature, Napoleon III's reforms remained popular in the rest of the country. A new [[1870 French constitutional referendum|plebiscite was held in 1870]], on this text: \"The people approve the liberal reforms added to the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the agreement of the legislative bodies and ratified by the Senate on April 20, 1870.\" Napoleon III saw this as a referendum on his rule as Emperor: \"By voting yes,\" he wrote, \"you will chase away the threat of revolution; you will place the nation on a solid base of order and liberty, and you will make it easier to pass on the Crown to my son.\" When the votes were counted, Napoleon III had lost Paris and the other big cities but decisively won the rest of the country. The final vote was 7,336,434 votes yes, 1,560,709 votes no, and 1,900,000 abstentions. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], the leader of the republican opposition, wrote in despair, \"We were crushed. The Emperor is more popular than ever.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 370</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n\n===Declining health and rise of Prussia===\nThrough the 1860s, the health of the Emperor steadily worsened. It had been damaged by his six years in prison at Ham; he had chronic pains in his legs and feet, particularly when it was cold, and as a result, he always lived and worked in overheated rooms and offices. He smoked heavily. He distrusted doctors, disregarded medical advice and attributed any problems simply to \"rheumatism\", for which he regularly visited the hot springs at [[Vichy]] and other spas. It became difficult for him to ride a horse, and he was obliged to walk slowly, often with a cane. From 1869 onwards, the crises of his urinary tract were treated with [[opium]], which made him seem lethargic and apathetic. His writing became hard to read and his voice weak. In the spring of 1870, he was visited by an old friend from England, [[James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]. Malmesbury found him to be \"terribly changed and very ill\".<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 449</ref>\n\nThe health problems of the Emperor were kept secret by the government, which feared that, if his condition became public, the opposition would demand his abdication. One newspaper, the ''Courrier de la Vienne'', was warned by the censors to stop publishing articles which had \"a clear and malicious intent to spread, contrary to the truth, alarms about the health of the Emperor\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 338</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1870, a specialist in the problems of urinary tracts, [[Germain S\u00e9e]], was finally summoned to examine him. S\u00e9e reported that the Emperor was suffering from a [[gallstone]]. On 2 July, four eminent French doctors, N\u00e9laton, Ricord, Fauvel and Corvisart, examined him and confirmed the diagnosis. They were reluctant to operate, however, because of the high risk (gallstone operations did not become relatively safe until the 1880s) and because of the Emperor's weakness. Before anything further could be done, however, France was in the middle of a diplomatic crisis.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 450</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, [[Prussia]] appeared on the horizon as a new rival to French power in Europe. Its chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], had ambitions for Prussia to lead a [[German unification|unified Germany]]. In May 1862, Bismarck came to Paris on a diplomatic mission and met Napoleon III for the first time. They had cordial relations. On 30 September 1862, however, in Munich, Bismarck declared, in a famous speech: \"It is not by speeches and votes of the majority that the great questions of our period will be settled, as one believed in 1848, but by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|iron and blood]].\" Bismarck saw Austria and France as the main obstacles to his ambitions, and he set out to divide and defeat them.\n\n===Search for allies, and war between Austria and Prussia===\n\nIn the winter and spring of 1864, when the [[North German Confederation]] (and southern German allies) [[Second Schleswig War|invaded and occupied]] the German-speaking provinces of [[Denmark]] ([[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]), Napoleon III recognized the threat that a unified Germany would pose to France, and he looked for allies to challenge Germany, without success.\n\nThe British government was suspicious that Napoleon wanted to take over Belgium and Luxembourg, felt secure with its powerful navy, and did not want any military engagements on the European continent at the side of the French.\n\nThe Russian government was also suspicious of Napoleon, whom it believed had encouraged Polish nationalists to [[January Uprising|rebel against Russian rule]] in 1863. Bismarck and Prussia, on the other hand, had offered assistance to Russia to help crush the Polish patriots.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 376\u201377</ref>\n\nIn October 1865, Napoleon had a cordial meeting with Bismarck at [[Biarritz]]. They discussed Venetia, Austria's remaining province in Italy. Bismarck told Napoleon that Germany had no secret arrangement to give Venetia to Italy, and Napoleon assured him in turn that France had no secret understanding with Austria. Bismarck hinted vaguely that, in the event of a war between Austria and Prussia, French neutrality would be rewarded with some sort of territory as a compensation. Napoleon III had Luxembourg in mind.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 649</ref>\n\nIn 1866, relations between Austria and Prussia worsened and Bismarck demanded the expulsion of Austria from the German Confederation. Napoleon and his foreign minister, [[Drouyn de Lhuys]], expected a long war and an eventual Austrian victory. Napoleon III felt he could extract a price from both Prussia and Austria for French neutrality. On 12 June 1866, France signed a secret treaty with Austria, guaranteeing French neutrality in a Prussian-Austrian war. In exchange, in the event of an Austrian victory, Austria would give Venetia to France and would also create a new independent German state on the Rhine, which would become an ally of France. At the same time, Napoleon proposed a secret treaty with Bismarck, promising that France would remain neutral in a war between Austria and Prussia. In the event of a Prussian victory, France would recognize Prussia's annexation of smaller German states, and France, in exchange, would receive a portion of German territory, the [[Palatinate region]] north of Alsace. Bismarck, rightly confident of success due to the modernization of the [[Prussian Army]], summarily rejected Napoleon's offer.\n\nOn 15 June, the Prussian Army invaded [[Saxony]], an ally of Austria. On 2 July, Austria asked Napoleon to arrange an armistice between Italy, which had allied itself with Prussia, and Austria, in exchange for which France would receive Venetia. But on 3 July, the Prussian army crushed the Austrian army at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] in [[Bohemia]]. The way to Vienna was open for the Prussians, and Austria asked for an armistice. The armistice was signed on 22 July; Prussia annexed the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], the [[Electorate of Hesse-Kassel]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]] and the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], with a combined population of four million people.<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\">Girard, 1986, p. 380</ref>\n\nThe Austrian defeat was followed by a new crisis in the health of Napoleon III. [[Marshal Canrobert]], who saw him on 28 July, wrote that the Emperor \"was pitiful to see. He could barely sit up in his armchair, and his drawn face expressed at the same time moral anguish and physical pain.\"<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\"/>\n\n===Luxembourg Crisis===\n{{Main|Luxembourg Crisis}}\nNapoleon III still hoped to receive some compensation from Prussia for French neutrality during the war. His foreign minister, Drouyn, asked Bismarck for the Palatinate region on the Rhine, which belonged to Bavaria, and for the demilitarization of Luxembourg, which was the site of a [[Fortress of Luxembourg|formidable fortress]] staffed by a strong Prussian garrison in accordance with international treaties. Napoleon's senior advisor [[Eug\u00e8ne Rouher]] increased the demands, asking that Prussia accept the annexation by France of Belgium and of Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg had regained its [[de jure]] independence in 1815 as a [[grand duchy]]. However, it was in [[personal union]] with the Netherlands. King [[William III of the Netherlands]], who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, desperately needed money and was prepared to sell the Grand Duchy to France. Bismarck swiftly intervened and showed the British ambassador a copy of Napoleon's demands; as a result, he put pressure on William III to refuse to sell Luxembourg to France. France was forced to renounce any claim to Luxembourg in the [[Treaty of London (1867)]]. Napoleon III gained nothing for his efforts but the demilitarization of the Luxembourg fortress.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=203}}</ref>\n\n===Failure to increase the size of the French army===\nDespite his failing health, Napoleon III could see that the Prussian Army, combined with the armies of Bavaria and the other German states, would be a formidable enemy. In 1866, Prussia, with a population of 22 million, had been able to mobilize an army of 700,000 men, while France, with a population of 26 million, had an army of only 385,000 men, of whom 140,000 were in Algeria, Mexico, and Rome.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 387</ref> In the autumn of 1867, Napoleon III proposed a form of universal military service similar to the Prussian system to increase the size of the French Army, if needed, to 1 million. His proposal was opposed by many French officers, such as [[Marshal Randon]], who preferred a smaller, more professional army; he said: \"This proposal will only give us recruits; it's soldiers we need.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 389</ref> It was also strongly opposed by the republican opposition in the French parliament, who denounced the proposal as a militarization of French society. The republican deputy, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], who later became Napoleon's prime minister, declared: \"The armies of France, which I always considered too large, are now going to be increased to an exorbitant size. Why? What is the necessity? Where is the danger? Who is threatening us? ...If France were to disarm, the Germans would know how to convince their governments to do the same. \"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 392</ref> Facing almost certain defeat in the parliament, Napoleon III withdrew the proposal. It was replaced in January 1868 by a much more modest project to create a ''garde mobile'', or reserve force, to support the army.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Howard|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2wEeRuei6AC|year=1981|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=30, 38\u201339|isbn=9780203993057}}</ref>\n\n===A last search for allies===\nNapoleon III was overconfident in his military strength and went into war even after he failed to find any allies who would support a war to stop German unification.<ref>James D.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706889 online]</ref>\n \nFollowing the defeat of Austria, Napoleon resumed his search for allies against Prussia. In April 1867, he proposed an alliance, defensive and offensive, with Austria. If Austria joined France in a victorious war against Prussia, Napoleon promised that Austria could form a new confederation with the southern states of Germany and could annex [[Silesia]], while France took for its part the left bank of the [[Rhine River]]. But the timing of Napoleon's offer was poorly chosen; Austria was in the process of a [[Ausgleich|major internal reform]], creating a new twin monarchy structure with two components, one being the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] and the other being the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nNapoleon's attempt to install the archduke Maximilian, the brother of the Austrian Emperor, in Mexico was just coming to its disastrous conclusion; the French troops had just been withdrawn from Mexico in February 1867, and the unfortunate Maximilian would be captured, judged and shot by a firing squad on 19 June. Napoleon III made these offers again in August 1867, on a visit to offer condolences for the death of Maximilian, but the proposal was not received with enthusiasm.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Adolphe Yvon - Portrait of Napoleon III - Walters 3795.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Napoleon III in 1868 by [[Adolphe Yvon]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/597|title= Portrait of Napoleon III}}</ref>]]\nNapoleon III also made one last attempt to persuade Italy to be his ally against Prussia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel was personally favorable to a better relationship with France, remembering the role that Napoleon III had played in achieving Italian unification, but Italian public opinion was largely hostile to France; on 3 November 1867, French and Papal soldiers had fired upon the Italian patriots of Garibaldi, when he tried to capture Rome. Napoleon presented a proposed treaty of alliance on 4 June 1869, the anniversary of the joint French-Italian victory at Magenta. The Italians responded by demanding that France withdraw its troops who were protecting the Pope in Rome. Given the opinion of fervent French Catholics, this was a condition Napoleon III could not accept.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon III was having no success finding allies, Bismarck signed secret military treaties with the southern German states, who promised to provide troops in the event of a war between Prussia and France. In 1868, Bismarck signed an accord with Russia that gave Russia liberty of action in the Balkans in exchange for neutrality in the event of a war between France and Prussia. This treaty put additional pressure on Austria, which also had interests in the Balkans, not to ally itself with France. Bismarck also reached out to the liberal government of [[William Gladstone]] in London, offering to protect the neutrality of Belgium against a French threat. The British Foreign Office under [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]] mobilized the British fleet, to dissuade France against any aggressive moves against Belgium. In any war between France and Prussia, France would be entirely alone.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\nBismarck thought that French vanity would lead to war; he exploited that vanity in the [[Ems Dispatch]] in July 1870. France took the bait and declared war on Prussia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alison Kitson|title=Germany 1858\u20131990: Hope, Terror and Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwyp6RYFNhsC&pg=PA1870|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=1870|isbn=978-0199134175}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, French politician [[Adolphe Thiers]] (who became President of the French Republic in 1871) accused Napoleon III of erroneous foreign policy: \"There is no mistake that can be made\".<ref>History of the XIX century (1848-1871). In 5 volumes. Under the editorship of professors of Lavisse and Rambaud. Second edition. Volume 5. Part 1. \u2013 M. p. 182</ref> Napoleon III and France in the summer of 1870, however, made a serious mistake when France declared war on Prussia. This allowed Bismarck and Prussia to present the war to the world as defensive, although Prussia and Bismarck had aggressive plans, and they soon became known in relation to the annexation of the French provinces of Alsace and [[Lorraine]].\n\n===Hohenzollern candidacy and the Ems telegram===\n{{Main|Ems Dispatch}}\nIn his memoirs, written long after the war, Bismarck wrote, \"I always considered that a war with France would naturally follow a war against Austria... I was convinced that the gulf which was created over time between the north and the south of Germany could not be better overcome than by a national war against the neighbouring people who were aggressive against us. I did not doubt that it was necessary to make a French-German war before the general reorganization of Germany could be realized.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 394</ref> As the summer of 1870 approached, pressure mounted on Bismarck to have a war with France as quickly as possible. In [[Bavaria]], the largest of the southern German states, unification with (mostly Protestant) Prussia was being opposed by the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Patriotic Party]], which favoured a confederacy of (Catholic) Bavaria with (Catholic) Austria. German Protestant public opinion was on the side of unification with Prussia.\n\nIn France, patriotic sentiment was also growing. On 8 May 1870, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869. The Emperor was less popular in Paris and the big cities, but highly popular in the French countryside. Napoleon had named a new foreign minister, Antoine Agenor, [[Agenor, duc de Gramont|the Duke de Gramont]], who was hostile to Bismarck. The Emperor was weak and ill, but the more extreme Bonapartists were prepared to show their strength against the republicans and monarchists in the parliament.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201350</ref>\n[[File:LeopoldHS.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]]]]\n\nIn July 1870, Bismarck found a cause for a war in an old dynastic dispute. In September 1868, Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] had been overthrown and exiled to France. The new government of Spain considered several candidates, including [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]], a cousin of [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. At the end of 1869, Napoleon III had let it be known to the Prussian king and his Chancellor Bismarck that a Hohenzollern prince on the throne of Spain would not be acceptable to France. King Wilhelm had no desire to enter into a war against Napoleon III and did not pursue the subject further. At the end of May, however, Bismarck wrote to the father of Leopold, asking him to put pressure on his son to accept the candidacy to be King of Spain. Leopold, solicited by both his father and Bismarck, agreed.\n\nThe news of Leopold's candidacy, published 2 July 1870, aroused fury in the French parliament and press. The government was attacked by both the republicans and monarchist opposition, and by the ultra-Bonapartists, for its weakness against Prussia. On 6 July, Napoleon III held a meeting of his ministers at the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Cloud and told them that Prussia must withdraw the Hohenzollern candidacy or there would be a war. He asked [[Edmond Le Boeuf|Marshal Leboeuf]], the chief of staff of the French army, if the army was prepared for a war against Prussia. Leboeuf responded that the French soldiers had a rifle superior to the Prussian rifle, that the French artillery was commanded by an elite corps of officers, and that the army \"would not lack a button on its [[puttees]]\". He assured the Emperor that the French army could have four hundred thousand men on the Rhine in less than fifteen days.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 52</ref>\n\nKing Wilhelm I did not want to be seen as the instigator of the war; he had received messages urging restraint from Emperor Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King of the Belgians]]. On 10 July, he told Leopold's father that his candidacy should be withdrawn. Leopold resisted the idea, but finally agreed on the 11th, and the withdrawal of the candidacy was announced on the 12th, a diplomatic victory for Napoleon. On the evening of the 12th, after meeting with the Empress and with his foreign minister, Gramont, he decided to push his success a little further; he would ask King Wilhelm to guarantee the Prussian government would never again make such a demand for the Spanish throne.\n\nThe French Ambassador to Prussia, Count [[Vincent Benedetti]], was sent to the German spa resort of [[Bad Ems]], where the Prussian King was staying. Benedetti met with the King on 13 July in the park of the ch\u00e2teau. The King told him courteously that he agreed fully with the withdrawal of the Hohenzollern candidacy, but that he could not make promises on behalf of the government for the future. He considered that the matter was closed. As he was instructed by Gramont, Benedetti asked for another meeting with the King to repeat the request, but the King politely, yet firmly, refused. Benedetti returned to Paris and the affair seemed finished. However, Bismarck edited the official dispatch of the meeting to make it appear that both sides had been hostile: \"His majesty the King,\" the dispatch read, \"refused to meet again with the French ambassador, and let him know, through an aide-de-camp of service, that His Majesty had nothing more to say to the Ambassador.\" This version was communicated to governments, and the next day was in the French press.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nThe [[Ems telegram]] had exactly the effect that Bismarck had intended. Once again, public opinion in France was inflamed. \"This text produced the effect of a red flag to the Gallic bull,\" Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt \"he had just received a slap.\" The leader of the conservatives in parliament, Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honourably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility \"with a light heart\". A crowd of 15\u201320,000 persons, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On 19 July 1870, a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\n===Defeat in the Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Place de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|At the outbreak of the war, crowds gathered on the Place de la Bastille, chanting \"To Berlin!\"]]\n\nWhen France entered the war, there were patriotic demonstrations in the streets of Paris, with crowds singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and chanting \"To Berlin! To Berlin!\" But Napoleon was melancholic. He told General Lepic that he expected the war to be \"long and difficult\", and wondered, \"Who knows if we'll come back?\" He told [[Jacques Louis Randon|Marshal Randon]] that he felt too old for a military campaign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 473</ref> Despite his ill health, Napoleon decided to go with the army to the front as commander in chief, as he had done during the successful Italian campaign. On 28 July, he departed Saint-Cloud by train for the front. He was accompanied by the 14-year-old Prince Imperial in the uniform of the army, by his military staff, and by a large contingent of chefs and servants in livery. He was pale and visibly in pain. The Empress remained in Paris as the [[Regent]], as she had done on other occasions when the Emperor was out of the country.\n\nThe mobilization of the French army was chaotic. Two hundred thousand soldiers converged on the German frontier, along a front of 250 kilometers, choking all the roads and railways for miles. Officers were unable to find their units, and units were unable to find their officers. General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]] and the German army, with experience mobilizing in the war against Austria, were able to efficiently move three armies of 518,000 men to a more concentrated front of just 120 kilometers. In addition, the German soldiers were backed by a substantial reserve of the [[Landwehr]] (Territorial defence), with 340,000 men, and an additional reserve of 400,000 territorial guards. The French army arrived at the frontier equipped with maps of Germany, but without maps of France\u2014where the actual fighting took place\u2014and without a specific plan of what it was going to do.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, Napoleon and the Prince Imperial accompanied the army as it made a tentative crossing of the German border toward the city of [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The French won a minor skirmish and advanced no further. Napoleon III, very ill, was unable to ride his horse and had to support himself by leaning against a tree. In the meantime, the Germans had assembled a much larger army opposite Alsace and Lorraine than the French had expected or were aware of. On 4 August 1870, the Germans attacked with overwhelming force against a French division in Alsace at the [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Battle of Wissembourg]] (German: Weissenburg), forcing it to retreat. On 5 August, the Germans defeated another French Army at the [[Battle of Spicheren]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].\n\nOn 6 August, 140,000 Germans attacked 35,000 French soldiers at the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]]; the French lost 19,200 soldiers killed, wounded and captured, and were forced to retreat. The French soldiers fought bravely, and French cavalry and infantry attacked the German lines repeatedly, but the Germans had superior logistics, communications, and leadership. The decisive weapon was the new German [[C64 (field gun)|Krupp six pound field gun]], which had a steel barrel, was loaded by the breech, had a longer range, had a higher rate of fire, and was more accurate than the bronze muzzle-loading French cannons. The Krupp guns caused terrible casualties in the French ranks.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 61</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal [[Edmond Le Boeuf]], both resigned. The Empress Eug\u00e9nie took it upon herself as the Regent to name a new government. She chose General [[Cousin-Montauban]], better known as the Count of Palikao, seventy-four years old, the former commander of the French expeditionary force to China, as her new prime minister. The Count of Palikao named Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]], the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The Empress, in charge of the government responded by telegraph, \"Don't think of coming back, unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger.\" The Emperor agreed to remain with the army.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 80\u201381</ref> With the Empress directing the country, and Bazaine commanding the army, the Emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the Emperor told Marshal Leboeuf, \"we've both been dismissed.\"<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 81</ref>\n\nOn 18 August 1870, the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], the biggest battle of the war, took place in Lorraine between the Germans and the army of Marshal Bazaine. The Germans suffered 20,000 casualties and the French 12,000, but the Germans emerged as the victors, as Marshal Bazaine's army, with 175,000 soldiers, six divisions of cavalry and five hundred cannons, was trapped inside the fortifications of Metz, unable to move.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\">Milza, 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nNapoleon was at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] with the army of Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon]]. MacMahon, Marshal Bazaine, and the count of Palikao, with the Empress in Paris, all had different ideas on what the army should do next, and the Emperor had to act as a referee among them. The Emperor and MacMahon proposed moving their army closer to Paris to protect the city, but on 17 August Bazaine telegraphed to the Emperor: \"I urge you to renounce this idea, which seems to abandon the Army at Metz... Couldn't you make a powerful diversion toward the Prussian corps, which are already exhausted by so many battles? The Empress shares my opinion.\" Napoleon III wrote back, \"I yield to your opinion.\"<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 480</ref> The Emperor sent the Prince Imperial back to Paris for his safety, and went with the weary army in the direction of Metz. The Emperor, riding in an open carriage, was jeered, sworn at and insulted by demoralized soldiers.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\"/>\n\nThe direction of movement of MacMahon's army was supposed to be secret, but it was published in the French press and thus was quickly known to the German general staff. Moltke, the German commander, ordered two Prussian armies marching toward Paris to turn towards MacMahon's army. On 30 August, one corps of MacMahon's army was attacked by the Germans at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]], losing five hundred men and forty cannons. MacMahon, believing he was ahead of the Germans, decided to stop and reorganize his forces at the fortified city of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], in the [[Ardennes]] close to the Belgian border.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 482</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sedan and capitulation====\n{{Further|Battle of Sedan (1870)}}\n[[File:The fallen emperor and triumphant statesman talked together.jpg|thumb|Bismarck with Napoleon III after his capitulation]]\n\nThe Battle of Sedan was a total disaster for the French\u2014the army surrendered to the Prussians and Napoleon himself was made a prisoner of war.<ref>Alan Strauss-Schom, ''The Shadow Emperor: A Biography of Napoleon III'' (2018) pp. 404\u201318.</ref> MacMahon arrived at Sedan with one hundred thousand soldiers, not knowing that two German armies were closing in on the city (one from the west and one from the east), blocking any escape. The Germans arrived on 31 August, and by 1 September, occupied the heights around Sedan, placed batteries of artillery, and began to shell the French positions below. At five o'clock in the morning on 1 September, a German shell seriously wounded MacMahon in the hip. Sedan soon came under bombardment from seven hundred German guns.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\">Milza, 2006, p. 708</ref> MacMahon's replacement, General [[Emmanuel F\u00e9lix de Wimpffen|Wimpffen]], launched a series of valiant cavalry attacks to try to break the German encirclement, with no success. During the battle and bombardment, the French lost seventeen thousand killed or wounded and twenty-one thousand captured.\n\nAs the German shells rained down on the French positions, Napoleon III wandered aimlessly in the open around the French positions. One officer of his military escort was killed and two more received wounds. A doctor accompanying him wrote in his notebook, \"If this man has not come here to kill himself, I don't know what he has come to do. I have not seen him give an order all morning.\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\"/>\n\nFinally, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Napoleon emerged from his [[daydream|reverie]] and ordered a white flag hoisted above the citadel. He then had a message sent to the Prussian King, who was at Sedan with his army: \"Monsieur my brother, not being able to die at the head of my troops, nothing remains for me but to place my sword in the hands of Your Majesty.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 709</ref>\n\nAfter the war, when accused of having made a \"shameful surrender\" at Sedan, he wrote: \n\n{{bquote|Some people believe that, by burying ourselves under the ruins of Sedan, we would have better served my name and my dynasty. It's possible. Nay, to hold in my hand the lives of thousands of men and not to make a sign to save them was something that was beyond my capacity....my heart refused these sinister grandeurs.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 79</ref>}}\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning on 2 September, in the uniform of a general and accompanied by four generals from his staff, Napoleon was taken to the German headquarters at [[Donchery]]. He expected to see King William, but instead he was met by Bismarck and the German commander, General von Moltke. They dictated the terms of the surrender to Napoleon. Napoleon asked that his army be disarmed and allowed to pass into Belgium, but Bismarck refused. They also asked Napoleon to sign the preliminary documents of a peace treaty, but Napoleon refused, telling them that the French government headed by the Regent, Empress Eug\u00e9nie, would need to negotiate any peace agreement. The Emperor was then taken to the Chateau at Bellevue near {{interlanguage link|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)|fr|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)}}, where the Prussian King visited him. Napoleon told the King that he had not wanted the war, but that public opinion had forced him into it. The Prussian king politely agreed.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} That evening, from the Chateau, Napoleon wrote to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie: \n\n{{bquote|It is impossible for me to say what I have suffered and what I am suffering now...I would have preferred death to a capitulation so disastrous, and yet, under the present circumstances, it was the only way to avoid the butchering of sixty thousand people. If only all my torments were concentrated here! I think of you, our son, and our unhappy country.<ref>\nMilza, 2006, p. 710\n</ref>}}\n\n====Aftermath====\nThe news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September, confirming the rumors that were already circulating in the city. When the news was given to the Empress that the Emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, \"No! An Emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!\".<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 711</ref> Later, when hostile crowds formed near the palace, and the staff began to flee, the Empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, who took her to [[Deauville]]. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England. On 4 September, a group of republican deputies, led by [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], gathered at the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]] in Paris and proclaimed the return of the Republic and the creation of a [[Government of National Defence]]. The Second Empire had come to an end.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 711\u201312</ref>\n\n===Captivity, exile and death===\n\n====Final months====\nFrom 5 September 1870 until 19 March 1871, Napoleon III and his entourage of thirteen aides were held in comfortable captivity in a castle at [[Wilhelmsh\u00f6he]], near [[Kassel]].

The idea was for Bazaine to establish a conservative regime in France, for himself or for Napoleon's son.<ref>Geoffrey Wawro: ''The Franco-Prussian War.

Bazaine was willing to take over power in France after the Germans had defeated the republic in Paris.

But by this time, Metz had already fallen, leaving Napoleon without a power basis. Bismarck did not see much chance for a restored empire as Napoleon would look like a marionette of the enemy to the French people.<ref>David Wetzel: ''A Duel of Nations.

Bonapartist candidates participated in the first elections for the National Assembly on 8 February, but won only five seats. On 1 March, the newly elected assembly officially declared the removal of the Emperor from power and placed all the blame for the French defeat squarely on him.<ref name=\"Louis Girard p. 488\"/> When peace was arranged between France and Germany, Bismarck released Napoleon. He decided to go into exile in England. Napoleon had limited funds; he sold properties and jewels and arrived in England on 20 March 1871.\n\n[[File:Napoleon III after Death - Illustrated London News Jan 25 1873-2.PNG|thumb|Napoleon III after his death, wood-engraving in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' of 25 January 1873, after a photograph by Mssrs.

Strode bought Camden Place in 1860 and spent large sums of money transforming it into a French chateau. Strode had also received money from the Emperor, possibly to buy Camden Place and maintain it as a [[Retreat (survivalism)|bolt hole]].<ref>[http://www.chislehurst-society.org.uk/Pages/About/People/NapoleonIII.html Napoleon III of France<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNapoleon passed his time writing and designing a stove which would be more energy efficient. In the summer of 1872, his health began to worsen. Doctors recommended surgery to remove his gallstones. After two operations, he became very seriously ill.

Two of France's largest banks, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], still in existence today, were founded during that period. The French stock market also expanded prodigiously, with many coal mining and steel companies issuing stocks. Historians credit Napoleon chiefly for supporting the railways, but not otherwise building the economy.<ref>Charles P. Kindleberger, ''Economic Growth in France and Britain 1851\u20131950'' (1964) pp. 6, 42, 186\u201388</ref>\n\nNapoleon's military pressure and Russian mistakes, culminating in the Crimean War, dealt a fatal blow to the [[Concert of Europe]]. It was based on stability and balance of powers, whereas Napoleon attempted to rearrange the world map to France's favour even when it involved radical and potentially revolutionary changes in politics. A [[Canon obusier de 12|12-pound cannon]] designed by France is commonly referred to as a \"Napoleon cannon\" or \"12-pounder Napoleon\" in his honour.\n\n===Historical reputation===\nThe historical reputation of Napoleon III is far below that of his uncle. [[Victor Hugo]] portrayed him as \"Napoleon the Small\" (''[[Napol\u00e9on le Petit]]''), a mere mediocrity, in contrast with Napoleon I \"The Great\", presented as a military and administrative genius. In France, such arch-opposition from the age's central literary figure, whose attacks on Napoleon III were obsessive and powerful, made it impossible for a very long time to assess his reign objectively. [[Karl Marx]], in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', famously mocked Napoleon III by saying \"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historical facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\" Napoleon III has often been seen as an authoritarian but ineffectual leader who brought France into dubious, and ultimately disastrous, foreign military adventures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

His greatest achievements came in material improvements, in the form of  a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris. He is given high credits for the rebuilding of Paris with broad boulevards, striking public buildings, and very attractive residential districts for upscale Parisians. He promoted French business and exports. In international policy, he tried to emulate his uncle, with numerous imperial ventures around the world, as well as wars in Europe. He badly mishandled the threat from Prussia and found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming force.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''[France: 1815 to the Present'' (1963) online p. 275]</ref>\n\nHistorians have also praised his attention to the fate of the working classes and poor people. His book ''Extinction du paup\u00e9risme'' (\"Extinction of pauperism\"), which he wrote while imprisoned at the Fort of Ham in 1844, contributed to his popularity among the working classes and thus his election in 1848. Throughout his reign, the emperor worked to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, on occasion breaching the 19th-century economic orthodoxy of freedom and [[laissez-faire]] and using state resources or interfering in the market. Among other things, the Emperor granted the right to strike to French workers in 1864, despite intense opposition from corporate lobbies.\n\n===Screen===\n\nOn screen Napoleon has been portrayed by:\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] in \n**''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' (1936)\n**''[[A Dispatch from Reuter's]]'' (1940)\n* [[Frank Vosper]] in ''[[Spy of Napoleon]]'' (1936)\n* [[Guy Bates Post]] in \n**''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937) \n**''[[The Mad Empress]]'' (1939)\n* [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]] in ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'' (1938)\n* [[Claude Rains]] in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'' (1939) \n* [[Walter Franck]] in ''[[Bismarck (1940 film)|Bismarck]]'' (1940)\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] in ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n* David Bond in ''[[The Sword of Monte Cristo]]'' (1951)\n* [[Siegfried Wischnewski]] in ''[[Maximilian von Mexiko]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximilian von Mexiko|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379886/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Robert Dumont in ''[[Those Years]]'' (Spanish: ''Aquellos a\u00f1os'', 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquellos a\u00f1os|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193724/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Julian Sherrier in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'' (1975)\n* [[Nick Jameson]] in ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'' (1998)\n* [[Erwin Steinhauer]] in ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sisi|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442136/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also plays a small but crucial role in ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' (2015).\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 9 July 1810: His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France, Prince of Holland\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 20 December 1848: His Imperial Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France\n* 20 December 1848 \u2013 2 December 1852: His Imperial Highness The Prince-President of the French Republic (\"''{{lang|fr|Son Altesse Imp\u00e9riale le Prince-President}}''\")\n* 2 December 1852 \u2013 1 March 1871: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French\n* 1 March 1871 \u2013 9 January 1873: His Imperial Majesty Napol\u00e9on III{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHis full title as emperor was: \"Napoleon the Third, [[By the Grace of God]] and the will of the [[Second French Empire|Nation]], [[Emperor of the French]]\".<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/napoleon.htm#naptitles \"Napol\u00e9on's Titles\"].

I]], was the first [[president of France]] from 1848 to 1852, and the last [[French monarch]] from 1852 to 1870. First elected president of the [[French Second Republic]] in [[1848 French presidential election|1848]], he seized power in 1851, when he could not constitutionally be re-elected, and became the [[emperor of the French]]. He founded the [[Second French Empire]] and was its only emperor until the defeat of the French army and his capture by [[Prussia]] and its allies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. He worked to modernize the French economy, rebuilt the center of Paris, expanded the [[French overseas empire]], and engaged in the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].\n\nNapoleon III commissioned a grand [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|reconstruction of Paris]] carried out by his prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]], and launched similar public works projects in [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]] and other French cities. Napoleon III modernized the French banking system, expanded and consolidated the French railway system, and made the French merchant marine the second largest in the world. He promoted the building of the [[Suez Canal]] and established modern agriculture, which ended famines in France and made France an agricultural exporter. Napoleon III negotiated the 1860 [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier free trade agreement]] with Britain and similar agreements with France's other European trading partners. Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize. The first women students were admitted at the Sorbonne and educational opportunities for women were increased, as did the list of required subjects in public schools.\n\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. He was a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and of [[nationalism]]. In Europe, he allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356). His regime assisted [[Italian unification]] by defeating the Austrian Empire in the [[Franco-Austrian War]] and later annexed [[Savoy]] and the [[County of Nice]] as its deferred reward. At the same time, his forces defended the [[Papal States]] against annexation by Italy.  He was also favorable towards the union of the Danubian Principalities (24th of January 1859), which resulted in the establishment of the modern state of [[Romania]]. Napoleon III doubled the area of the [[French overseas empire]] in Asia, the Pacific and Africa. On the other hand, the [[French intervention in Mexico]], which aimed to create a [[Second Mexican Empire]] under French protection, ended in total failure.\n\nFrom 1866, Napoleon had to face the mounting power of Prussia as its Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] sought German unification under Prussian leadership. In July 1870, Napoleon entered the Franco-Prussian War without allies and with inferior military forces. The French army was rapidly defeated and Napoleon III was captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. The [[French Third Republic]] was proclaimed in Paris and Napoleon went into exile in England, where he died in 1873.\n\n==Childhood and family==\n\n===Early life===\nCharles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, later known as Louis Napoleon and then Napoleon III, was born in Paris on the night of 19\u201320 April 1808. His father was [[Louis Bonaparte]], the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who made Louis the [[Kingdom of Holland|King of Holland]] from 1806 until 1810. His mother was [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], the only daughter of Napoleon's wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] by her first marriage to [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]].\n\nAs empress, Jos\u00e9phine proposed the marriage as a way to produce an heir for the Emperor, who agreed, as Jos\u00e9phine was by then infertile.<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 20</ref> Louis married Hortense when he was twenty-four and she was nineteen. They had a difficult relationship and only lived together for brief periods. Their first son [[Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte]] died in 1807 and\u2014though separated and parents of a healthy second son, [[Napol\u00e9on-Louis Bonaparte]]\u2014they decided to have a third child. They resumed their marriage for a brief time in Toulouse in July 1807, and Louis was born prematurely, two weeks short of nine months. Louis Napoleon's enemies, including [[Victor Hugo]], spread the gossip that he was the child of a different man, but most historians agree today that he was the legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 21\u201324</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, p. 15</ref> (see [[Napoleon III of France#Ancestry|ancestry]]).<ref>Bresler, 1999, p. 37</ref>\n\nCharles-Louis was baptized at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] on 5 November 1810, with Emperor Napoleon serving as his godfather and [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Empress Marie-Louise]] as his godmother. His father stayed away, once again separated from Hortense. At the age of seven, Louis Napoleon visited his uncle at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. Napoleon held him up to the window to see the soldiers parading in the courtyard of the Carousel below. He last saw his uncle with the family at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], shortly before Napoleon departed for the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nAll members of the [[Bonaparte dynasty]] were forced into exile after the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of monarchy in France. Hortense and Louis Napoleon moved from [[Aix-les-Bains|Aix]] to [[Bern]] to [[Baden-Baden|Baden]], and finally to a lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]] in the Swiss canton of [[Thurgau]]. He received some of his education in Germany at the [[gymnasium school]] at [[Augsburg]], Bavaria. As a result, for the rest of his life, his French had a slight but noticeable German accent. His tutor at home was [[Philippe Le Bas]], an ardent republican and the son of a revolutionary and close friend of [[Robespierre]]. Le Bas taught him French history and radical politics.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 39\u201342</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|[[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the King of Holland, and father of Napoleon III\nFile:Reine de Hollande et son fils.jpg|[[Hortense de Beauharnais]] (1783\u20131837), mother to Louis Napoleon in 1808\nFile:Schloss Arenenberg mit Kapelle und Napoleonmuseum.jpg|The lakeside house at [[Arenenberg]], Switzerland, where Louis Napoleon spent much of his youth and exile\n</gallery>\n\n===Romantic revolutionary (1823\u20131835)===\nWhen Louis Napoleon was fifteen, Hortense moved to Rome, where the Bonapartes had a villa. He passed his time learning Italian, exploring the ancient ruins, and learning the arts of seduction and romantic affairs, which he used often in his later life. He became friends with the French Ambassador, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Chateaubriand]], the father of romanticism in French literature, with whom he remained in contact for many years. He was reunited with his older brother [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte|Napoleon Louis]], and together they became involved with the [[Carbonari]], secret revolutionary societies fighting Austria's domination of northern Italy. In the spring of 1831, when he was twenty-three, the Austrian and papal governments launched an offensive against the Carbonari, and the two brothers, wanted by the police, were forced to flee. During their flight, Napoleon-Louis contracted measles and, on 17 March 1831, died in his brother's arms.<ref>Bresler, 1999, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Hortense joined her son and together they evaded the police and Austrian army and finally reached the French border.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 58\u201372</ref>\n\nHortense and Louis Napoleon travelled incognito to Paris, where the old regime of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had just fallen and been replaced by the more liberal regime of King [[Louis Philippe I]]. They arrived in Paris on 23 April 1831, and took up residence under the name \"Hamilton\" in the Hotel du Holland on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. Hortense wrote an appeal to the King, asking to stay in France, and Louis Napoleon offered to volunteer as an ordinary soldier in the French Army. The new King agreed to meet secretly with Hortense; Louis Napoleon had a fever and did not join them. The King finally agreed that Hortense and Louis Napoleon could stay in Paris as long as their stay was brief and incognito. Louis-Napoleon was told that he could join the French Army if he would simply change his name, something he indignantly refused to do. Hortense and Louis Napoleon remained in Paris until 5 May, the tenth anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. The presence of Hortense and Louis Napoleon in the hotel had become known, and a public demonstration of mourning for the Emperor took place on Place Vend\u00f4me in front of their hotel. The same day, Hortense and Louis Napoleon were ordered to leave Paris. They went to Britain briefly, and then back into exile in Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\n==Early adult years==\n\n===Bonapartist succession and philosophy of Bonapartism===\nEver since the fall of Napoleon in 1815, a [[Bonapartist]] movement had existed in France,  hoping to return a Bonaparte to the throne. According to the law of succession established by Napoleon I, the claim passed first to his own son, declared \"King of Rome\" at birth by his father. This heir, known by Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was living in virtual imprisonment at the court of [[Vienna]] under the title Duke of Reichstadt. Next in line was Napoleon I's eldest brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1768\u20131844), followed by [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), but neither Joseph nor Louis had any interest in re-entering public life. When the Duke of Reichstadt died in 1832, Louis Napoleon became the ''de facto'' heir of the dynasty and the leader of the Bonapartist cause.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nIn exile with his mother in Switzerland, he enrolled in the Swiss Army, trained to become an officer, and wrote a manual of artillery (his uncle Napoleon Bonaparte had become famous as an artillery officer). Louis Napoleon also began writing about his political philosophy \u2013 for as [[H. A. L. Fisher]] suggested, \"the programme of the Empire was not the improvisation of a vulgar adventurer\" but the result of deep reflection on the Napoleonic political philosophy and on how to adjust it to the changed domestic and international scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala|title= Bonapartism, six lectures delivered in the University of London|last= Fisher|first= Herbert Albert Laurens|publisher= Clarendon Press|year= 1908|isbn= |location= Oxford|page= [https://archive.org/details/bonapartismsixle00fishiala/page/87 87]}}</ref> He published his ''R\u00eaveries politiques'' or \"political dreams\" in 1833 at the age of 25, followed in 1834 by ''Consid\u00e9rations politiques et militaires sur la Suisse'' (\"Political and military considerations about Switzerland\"), followed in 1839 by ''Les Id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes'' (\"Napoleonic Ideas\"), a compendium of his political ideas which was published in three editions and eventually translated into six languages. He based his doctrine upon two ideas: universal suffrage and the primacy of the national interest. He called for a \"monarchy which procures the advantages of the Republic without the inconveniences\", a regime \"strong without despotism, free without anarchy, independent without conquest\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 61\u201362\n</ref>\n\n===Failed coup, and exile in London (1836\u20131840)===\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.JPG|thumb|Louis Napoleon at the time of his failed coup in 1836]]\n\"I believe,\" Louis Napoleon wrote, \"that from time to time, men are created whom I call volunteers of providence, in whose hands are placed the destiny of their countries. I believe I am one of those men. If I am wrong, I can perish uselessly. If I am right, then providence will put me into a position to fulfill my mission.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 68</ref> He had seen the popular enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte when he was in Paris, and he was convinced that, if he marched to Paris, as Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]], France would rise up and join him. He began to plan a coup against King Louis-Philippe.\n\n[[File:Soul\u00e8vement Strasbourg Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1836.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis Napoleon launching his failed coup in Strasbourg in 1836]]\nHe planned for his uprising to begin in [[Strasbourg]]. The colonel of a regiment was brought over to the cause. On 29 October 1836, Louis Napoleon arrived in Strasbourg, in the uniform of an artillery officer, and rallied the regiment to his side. The [[prefecture]] was seized, and the [[prefect]] arrested. Unfortunately for Louis-Napoleon, the general commanding the garrison escaped and called in a loyal regiment, which surrounded the mutineers. The mutineers surrendered and Louis-Napoleon fled back to Switzerland.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 97\u2013100</ref>\n\n===Travel===\nKing Louis-Philippe demanded that the Swiss government return Louis Napoleon to France, but the Swiss pointed out that he was a Swiss soldier and citizen, and refused to hand him over. Louis-Philippe responded by sending an army to the Swiss border. Louis Napoleon thanked his Swiss hosts, and voluntarily left the country. The other mutineers were put on trial in [[Alsace]], and were all acquitted.\n\nLouis Napoleon traveled first to London, then to Brazil, and then to New York. He moved into a hotel, where he met the elite of New York society and the writer [[Washington Irving]]. While he was traveling to see more of the United States, he received word that his mother was very ill. He hurried as quickly as he could back to Switzerland. He reached Arenenberg in time to be with his mother on 5 October 1837, when she died. She was finally buried in [[Reuil]], in France, next to her mother, on 11 January 1838, but Louis Napoleon could not attend, because he was not allowed into France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 107\u201308</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon returned to London for a new period of exile in October 1838. He had inherited a large fortune from his mother and took a house with seventeen servants and several of his old friends and fellow conspirators. He was received by London society and met the political and scientific leaders of the day, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Michael Faraday]]. He also did considerable research into the economy of Britain. He strolled in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], which he later used as a model when he created the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n===Second coup, prison, escape and exile (1840\u20131848)===\n\nLiving in the comfort of London, he had not given up the dream of returning to France to seize power. In the summer of 1840 he bought weapons and uniforms and had proclamations printed, gathered a contingent of about sixty armed men, hired a ship called the ''Edinburgh-Castle'', and on 6 August 1840, sailed across the [[English Channel|Channel]] to the port of [[Boulogne]]. The attempted coup turned into an even greater fiasco than the Strasbourg mutiny. The mutineers were stopped by the customs agents, the soldiers of the garrison refused to join, the mutineers were surrounded on the beach, one was killed and the others arrested. Both the British and French press heaped ridicule on Louis-Napoleon and his plot. The newspaper ''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' wrote, \"this surpasses comedy. One doesn't kill crazy people, one just locks them up.\" He was put on trial, where, despite an eloquent defense of his cause, he was sentenced to life in prison in the fortress of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] department of northern France.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 122\u201333</ref>\n\n===Activities===\nThe register of the fortress Ham for 7 October 1840 contained a concise description of the new prisoner: \"Age: thirty-two years. Height: one meter sixty-six. Hair and eyebrows: chestnut. Eyes: Gray and small. Nose: large. Mouth: ordinary. Beard: brown. Moustache: blond. Chin: pointed. Face: oval. Complexion: pale. Head: sunken in his shoulders, and large shoulders. Back: bent. Lips: thick.\"<ref>Quoted in S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 81</ref> He had a mistress named \u00c9l\u00e9onore Vergeot, a young woman from the nearby town, who gave birth to two of his children.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 83</ref>\n\nWhile in prison, he wrote poems, political essays, and articles on diverse topics. He contributed articles to regional newspapers and magazines in towns all over France, becoming quite well known as a writer. His most famous book was ''L'extinction du pauperisme'' (1844), a study of the causes of poverty in the French industrial working class, with proposals to eliminate it. His conclusion: \"The working class has nothing, it is necessary to give them ownership. They have no other wealth than their own labor, it is necessary to give them work that will benefit all....they are without organization and without connections, without rights and without a future; it is necessary to give them rights and a future and to raise them in their own eyes by association, education, and discipline.\" He proposed various practical ideas for creating a banking and savings system that would provide credit to the working class, and to establish agricultural colonies similar to the kibutzes later founded in Israel.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 89. Translated by D. Siefkin</ref> This book was widely reprinted and circulated in France, and played an important part in his future electoral success.\n\nHe was busy in prison, but also unhappy and impatient. He was aware that the popularity of Napoleon Bonaparte was steadily increasing in France; the Emperor was the subject of heroic poems, books and plays. Huge crowds had gathered in Paris on 15 December 1840 when the [[Retour des cendres|remains of Napoleon]] Bonaparte were returned with great ceremony to Paris and handed over to Louis Napoleon's old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, while Louis Napoleon could only read about it in prison. On 25 May 1846, with the assistance of his doctor and other friends on the outside, he disguised himself as a laborer carrying lumber, and walked out of the prison. His enemies later derisively called him \"Badinguet\", the name of the laborer whose identity he had assumed. A carriage was waiting to take him to the coast and then by boat to England. A month after his escape, his father Louis died, making Louis Napoleon the clear heir to the Bonaparte dynasty.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Return and early affairs===\nHe quickly resumed his place in British society. He lived on King Street in St James's, London, went to the theatre and hunted, renewed his acquaintance with Benjamin Disraeli, and met [[Charles Dickens]]. He went back to his studies at the British Museum. He had an affair with the actress [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]], the most famous French actress of the period, during her tours to Britain. More important for his future career, he had an affair with the wealthy heiress [[Harriet Howard]] (1823\u20131865). They met in 1846, soon after his return to Britain. They began to live together, she took in his two illegitimate children and raised them with her own son, and she provided financing for his political plans so that, when the moment came, he could return to France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte \u00e0 Boulogne (D\u00e9barquement en Ao\u00fbt 1840).JPG|Louis Napoleon's 1840 attempt to lead an uprising against Louis-Philippe ended in fiasco and ridicule.

Believing that his time had finally come, he set out for Paris on 27 February, departing England on the same day that Louis-Philippe left France for his own exile in England. When he arrived in Paris, he found that the Second Republic had been declared, led by a Provisional Government headed by a Commission led by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], and that different factions of republicans, from conservatives to those on the far left, were competing for power. He wrote to Lamartine announcing his arrival, saying that he \"was without any other ambition than that of serving my country\". Lamartine wrote back politely but firmly, asking Louis-Napoleon to leave Paris \"until the city is more calm, and not before the elections for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]\". His close advisors urged him to stay and try to take power, but he wanted to show his prudence and loyalty to the Republic; while his advisors remained in Paris, he returned to London on 2 March 1848 and watched events from there.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 102</ref>\n\nHe did not run in the first elections for the National Assembly, held in April 1848, but three members of the Bonaparte family, [[Jerome Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], [[Pierre Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and [[Prince Lucien Murat|Lucien Murat]] were elected; the name Bonaparte still had political power. In the next elections, on 4 June, where candidates could run in multiple departments, he was elected in four different departments; in Paris, he was among the top five candidates, just after the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. His followers were mostly on the left, from the peasantry and working class. His pamphlet on \"The Extinction of Pauperism\" was widely circulated in Paris, and his name was cheered with those of the socialist candidates [[Armand Barb\u00e8s|Barb\u00e8s]] and [[Louis Blanc]].<ref>'S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 105</ref>\n\nThe [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] leaders of the provisional government, Lamartine and [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac|Cavaignac]], considered arresting him as a dangerous revolutionary, but once again he outmaneuvered them. He wrote to the President of the Provisional Government: \"I believe I should wait to return to the heart of my country, so that my presence in France will not serve as a pretext to the enemies of the Republic.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 106</ref>\n\nIn June 1848, the [[June Days Uprising]] broke out in Paris, led by the far left, against the conservative majority in the National Assembly. Hundreds of barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods. General Cavaignac, the leader of the army, first withdrew his soldiers from Paris to allow the insurgents to deploy their barricades, and then returned with overwhelming force to crush the uprising; from 24 to 26 June, there were battles in the streets of the working class districts of Paris. An estimated five thousand insurgents were killed at the barricades, fifteen thousand were arrested, and four thousand deported.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nHis absence from Paris meant that Louis Napoleon was not connected either with the uprising, or with the brutal repression that had followed. He was still in London on 17\u201318 September, when the elections for the National Assembly were held, but he was a candidate in thirteen departments. He was elected in five departments; in Paris, he received 110,000 votes of the 247,000 cast, the highest number of votes of any candidate. He returned to Paris on 24 September, and this time he took his place in the National Assembly. In seven months, he had gone from a political exile in London to a highly visible place in the National Assembly, as the government finished the [[French Constitution of 1848|new Constitution]] and prepared for the first election ever of a President of the French Republic.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 182</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1848===\n{{further|French presidential election, 1848}}\n[[File:Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte pr\u00e9sident.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Louis Napoleon captured 74.2 percent of votes cast in the first French direct presidential elections in 1848.]]\nThe new constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], drafted by a commission including [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], called for a strong executive and a president elected by popular vote through universal male suffrage, rather than chosen by the National Assembly.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 111</ref> The [[1848 French presidential election|elections]] were scheduled for 10\u201311 December 1848. Louis Napoleon promptly announced his candidacy. There were four other candidates for the post: General Cavaignac, who had led the suppression of the June uprisings in Paris; Lamartine, the poet-philosopher and leader of the provisional government; [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]], the leader of the socialists; and [[Raspail]], the leader of the far left wing of the socialists.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 182\u201390</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon established his campaign headquarters and residence at the Hotel du Rhin on [[Place Vend\u00f4me]]. He was accompanied by his companion, Harriet Howard, who gave him a large loan to help finance his campaign. He rarely went to the sessions of the National Assembly and rarely voted. He was not a gifted orator; he spoke slowly, in a monotone, with a slight German accent from his Swiss education. His opponents sometimes ridiculed him, one comparing him to \"a turkey who believes he's an eagle\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 115</ref>\n\nHis campaign appealed to both the left and right. His election manifesto proclaimed his support for \"religion, family, property, the eternal basis of all social order\". But it also announced his intent \"to give work to those unoccupied; to look out for the old age of the workers; to introduce in industrial laws those improvements which don't ruin the rich, but which bring about the well-being of each and the prosperity of all\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 125</ref>\n\nHis campaign agents, many of them veterans from Napoleon Bonaparte's army, raised support for him around the country. Louis Napoleon won the grudging endorsement of the conservative leader [[Adolphe Thiers]], who believed he could be the most easily controlled; Thiers called him \"of all the candidates, the least bad\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 123</ref> He won the backing of ''L'Evenement'', the newspaper of Victor Hugo, which declared, \"We have confidence in him; he carries a great name.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 124</ref> His chief opponent, General Cavaignac, expected that Louis Napoleon would come in first, but that he would receive less than fifty percent of the vote, which would mean the election would go to the National Assembly, where Cavaignac was certain to win.\n\nThe elections were held on 10\u201311 December. Results were announced on 20 December. Louis Napoleon was widely expected to win, but the size of his victory surprised almost everyone. He won 5,572,834 votes, or 74.2 percent of votes cast, compared with 1,469,156 for Cavaignac. The socialist Ledru-Rollin received 376,834; the extreme left candidate Raspail 37,106, and the poet Lamartine only 17,000 votes. Louis Napoleon won the support of all segments of the population: the peasants unhappy with rising prices; unemployed workers; small businessmen who wanted prosperity and order; and intellectuals such as Victor Hugo. He won the votes of 55.6 percent of all registered voters, and won in all but four of France's departments.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 189\u201390</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Election france 1848.jpg|The 1848 presidential campaign pitted Louis Napoleon against General Cavaignac, the Minister of Defense of the Provisional Government, and the leaders of the socialists.\nFile:Extinction du Paup\u00e9risme par Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte 1.jpeg|Louis Napoleon's essay, \"The Extinction of Pauperism\", advocating reforms to help the working class, was widely circulated during the 1848 election campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Prince-President (1848\u20131851)===\nLouis Napoleon moved his residence to the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] at the end of December 1848 and immediately hung a portrait of his mother in the boudoir and a portrait of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, in his coronation robes, in the grand salon.

The previous government had sent an expeditionary force to Rome to help restore the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal authority]] of [[Pope Pius IX]], who was being threatened by the troops of the Italian republicans [[Mazzini]] and [[Garibaldi]]. The French troops came under fire from Garibaldi's soldiers. The Prince-President, without consulting his ministers, ordered his soldiers to fight if needed in support of the Pope. This was very popular with French Catholics, but infuriated the republicans, who supported Garibaldi.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 194\"/> To please the radical republicans, he asked the Pope to introduce liberal reforms and the ''[[Code Napoleon]]'' to the [[Papal States]]. To gain support from the Catholics, he approved the ''[[Loi Falloux]]'' in 1851, which restored a greater role for the Catholic Church in the French educational system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=Napol\u00e9on III and the Second Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqd6MdOYZkwC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=16|isbn=978-0203134245}}</ref>\n\nElections were held for the [[1849 French legislative election|National Assembly on 13\u201314 May 1849]], only a few months after Louis Napoleon had become President, and were largely won by a coalition of conservative republicans\u2014which Catholics and monarchists called \"The [[Party of Order]]\"\u2014led by Adolphe Thiers. The socialists and \"red\" republicans, led by Ledru-Rollin and Raspail, also did well, winning two hundred seats. The moderate republicans, in the middle, did very badly, taking just 70-80 seats. The Party of Order had a clear majority, enough to block any initiatives of Louis Napoleon.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 208\u201309</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 1849 the socialists and radical republicans made [[French demonstration of 15 May 1848|an attempt to seize power]]. Ledru-Rollin, from his headquarters in the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers|Conservatory of Arts and Professions]], declared that Louis Napoleon was no longer President and called for a general uprising. A few barricades appeared in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. Louis Napoleon acted swiftly, and the uprising was short-lived. Paris was declared in a state of siege, the headquarters of the uprising was surrounded, and the leaders arrested. Ledru-Rollin fled to England, Raspail was arrested and sent to prison, the republican clubs were closed, and their newspapers closed down.\n\nThe National Assembly, now without the left republicans and determined to keep them out forever, proposed a new election law that placed restrictions on universal male suffrage, imposing a three-year residency requirement. This new law excluded 3.5 of 9 million French voters, the voters that the leader of the Party of Order, Adolphe Thiers, scornfully called \"the vile multitude\".<ref>Cobban, p. 155</ref> This new election law was passed in May 1850 by a majority of 433 to 241, putting the National Assembly on a direct collision course with the Prince-President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald Aminzade|title=Ballots and Barricades: Class Formation and Republican Politics in France, 1830\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTbybLDLPiAC&pg=PA299|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=299|isbn=978-0691028712}}</ref> Louis Napoleon broke with the Assembly and the conservative ministers opposing his projects in favour of the dispossessed. He secured the support of the army, toured the country making populist speeches that condemned the Assembly, and presented himself as the protector of universal male suffrage. He demanded that the law be changed, but his proposal was defeated in the Assembly by a vote of 355 to 348.<ref>Cobban, p. 156</ref>\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 1848, he had to step down at the end of his term, so Louis Napoleon sought a constitutional amendment to allow him to succeed himself, arguing that four years were not enough to fully implement his political and economic program. He toured the country and gained support from many of the regional governments and many within the Assembly. The vote in July 1851 was 446 to 278 in favor of changing the law and allowing him to run again, but this was short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stevens Cabot Abbott|title=The history of Napoleon III., emperor of the French|publisher=B.B.

His half-brother Morny and a few close advisors quietly began to organize [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They brought Major General [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud]], a former captain from the [[French Foreign Legion]] and a commander of French forces in Algeria, and other officers from the French army in North Africa, to provide military backing for the coup. The date set for the coup was 2 December, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and the anniversary of the [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Louis Napoleon's uncle Napoleon I]]. On the night of 1\u20132 December, Saint Arnaud's soldiers quietly occupied the national printing office, the [[Palais Bourbon]], newspaper offices, and the strategic points in the city. In the morning, Parisians found posters around the city announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly, the restoration of universal suffrage, new elections, and a state of siege in Paris and the surrounding departments. Sixteen members of the National Assembly were arrested in their homes. When about 220 deputies of the moderate right gathered at the city hall of the [[10th arrondissement of Paris|10th arrondissement]], they were also arrested.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 255</ref> On 3 December, writer [[Victor Hugo]] and a few other republicans tried to organize an opposition to the coup. A few barricades appeared, and about 1,000 insurgents came out in the streets, but the army moved in force with 30,000 troops and the uprisings were swiftly crushed, with the killing of an estimated 300 to 400 opponents of the coup.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 261</ref> There were also small uprisings in the more militant red republican towns in the south and center of France, but these were all put down by 10 December.<ref>Cobban, pp. 157\u201358</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon followed the [[self-coup]] by a period of repression of his opponents, aimed mostly at the red republicans. About 26,000 people were arrested, including 4,000 in Paris alone. The 239 inmates who were judged most severely were sent to the penal colony in [[Cayenne]].<ref>Cobban, p. 158</ref> 9,530 followers were sent to [[French Algeria]], 1,500 were expelled from France, and another 3,000 were given forced residence away from their homes.<ref>Cobban and Milza</ref> Soon afterwards, a commission of revision freed 3,500 of those sentenced. In 1859, the remaining 1800 prisoners and exiles were amnestied, with the exception of the republican leader Ledru-Rollin, who was released from prison but required to leave the country.<ref>Cobban, p 158</ref>\n\nStrict press censorship was enacted by a decree from 17 February 1852. No newspaper dealing with political or social questions could be published without the permission of the government, fines were increased, and the list of press offenses was expanded. After three warnings, a newspaper or journal could be suspended or even permanently closed.<ref>Cobban, p. 159</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon wished to demonstrate that his new government had a broad popular mandate, so [[1851 French constitutional referendum|on 20\u201321 December a national plebiscite]] was held asking if voters agreed to the coup. Mayors in many regions threatened to publish the names of any electors who refused to vote. When asked if they agreed to the coup, 7,439,216 voters said yes, 641,737 voted no, and 1.7 million voters abstained.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 271</ref> The fairness and legality of the [[referendum]] was immediately questioned by Louis Napoleon's critics,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Edward Berenson|author2=Vincent Duclert|author3=Christophe Prochasson|title=The French Republic: History, Values, Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_eDj7dNMfwC&pg=PA34|year=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0801461125}}</ref> but Louis Napoleon was convinced that he had been given a public mandate to rule.\n\nHugo, who had originally supported Louis Napoleon but had been infuriated by the coup d'\u00e9tat, departed Paris for Brussels by train on 11 December 1851.

Work began on [[French Constitution of 1852|the new document]] in 1852. It was officially prepared by a committee of eighty experts, but was actually drafted by a small group of the Prince-President's inner circle. Under the new constitution, Louis-Napoleon was automatically reelected as president. Under Article Two, the president could now serve an unlimited number of 10-year terms. He alone was given the authority to declare war, sign treaties, form alliances and initiate laws. The Constitution re-established universal male [[suffrage]], and also retained a National Assembly, but with reduced authority.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 277</ref>\n\nLouis Napoleon's government imposed new authoritarian measures to control dissent and reduce the power of the opposition. One of his first acts was to settle scores with his old enemy, King Louis-Philippe, who had sent him to prison for life, and who had died in 1850. A decree on 23 January 1852 forbade the late King's family to own property in France and annulled the inheritance he had given to his children before he became King.\n\nThe National Guard, whose members had sometimes joined anti-government demonstrations, was re-organized and largely used only in parades. Government officials were required to wear uniforms at official formal occasions. The Minister of Education was given the power to dismiss professors at the universities and review the content of their courses. Students at the universities were forbidden to wear beards, seen as a symbol of republicanism.<ref name=\"Milsa, Pierre pg. 279\">Milza, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince-President of the Republic, 1852.jpg|thumb|Photographic portrait of Louis Napoleon (1852) by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nAn election was held for a new National Assembly on 29 February 1852, and all the resources of the government were used on behalf of the candidates backing the Prince-President. Of eight million eligible voters, 5,200,000 votes went to the official candidates and 800,000 to opposition candidates. About one third of the eligible voters abstained. The new Assembly included a small number of opponents of Louis Napoleon, including 17 monarchists, 18 conservatives, two liberal democrats, three republicans and 72 independents.<ref>Milsa, 2006, p. 279</ref>\n\nDespite now holding all governing power in the nation, Louis Napoleon was not content with being an authoritarian president. The ink had barely dried on the new, severely authoritarian constitution when he set about making himself emperor. Following the election, the Prince-President went on a triumphal national tour. In Marseille, he laid the cornerstone of a new cathedral, a new stock exchange, and a chamber of commerce. In Bordeaux, on 9 October 1852, he gave his principal speech:\n:Some people say the Empire is war. I say the Empire is peace. Like the Emperor I have many conquests to make\u2026 Like him I wish \u2026 to draw into the stream of the great popular river those hostile side-currents which lose themselves without profit to anyone. We have immense unplowed territories to cultivate; roads to open; ports to dig; rivers to be made navigable; canals to finish, a railway network to complete. We have, in front of Marseille, a vast kingdom to assimilate into France. We have all the great ports of the west to connect with the American continent by modern communications, which we still lack. We have ruins to repair, false gods to tear down, truths which we need to make triumph. This is how I see the Empire, if the Empire is re-established. These are the conquests I am considering, and you around me, who, like me, want the good of our country, you are my soldiers.\"<ref>Speech of 9 October in Bordeaux, published in ''Le Moniteur''.

[[Bon March\u00e9]] opened in 1852, followed by Au Printemps in 1865.]]\n\nOne of the first priorities of Napoleon III was the modernization of the French economy, which had fallen far behind that of the United Kingdom and some of the German states. Political economics had long been a passion of the Emperor. While in Britain, he had visited factories and railway yards, and in prison, he had studied and written about the sugar industry and policies to reduce poverty. He wanted the government to play an active, not a passive, role in the economy. In 1839, he had written: \"Government is not a necessary evil, as some people claim; it is instead the benevolent motor for the whole social organism.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 468</ref> He did not advocate the government getting directly involved in industry. Instead, the government took a very active role in building the infrastructure for economic growth; stimulating the stock market and investment banks to provide credit; building railways, ports, canals and roads; and providing training and education. He also opened up French markets to foreign goods, such as railway tracks from England, forcing French industry to become more efficient and more competitive.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 467\u201369</ref>\n\nThe period was favorable for industrial expansion. The gold rushes in [[California Gold Rush|California]] and [[Victorian gold rush|Australia]] increased the European money supply. In the early years of the Empire, the economy also benefited from the coming of age of those born during the baby boom of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] period.<ref>{{harvnb|Plessis|1989|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> The steady rise of prices caused by the increase of the money supply encouraged company promotion and investment of capital.\n\nBeginning in 1852, Napoleon III encouraged the creation of new banks, such as [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]], which sold shares to the public and provided loans to both private industry and to the government. [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] was founded in 1863 and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in 1864. These banks provided the funding for Napoleon III's major projects, from railway and canals to the rebuilding of Paris.\n\nIn 1851, France had only 3,500 kilometers of railway, compared with 10,000 kilometers in England and 800 kilometers in [[Belgium]], a country one-twentieth the size of France. Within days of the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851, Napoleon III's Minister of Public Works launched a project to build a railway line around Paris, connecting the different independent lines coming into Paris from around the country. The government provided guarantees for loans to build new lines and urged railway companies to consolidate. There were 18 railway companies in 1848 and six at the end of the Empire. By 1870, France had 20,000 kilometers of railway linked to the French ports and to the railway systems of the neighbouring countries that carried over 100 million passengers a year and transported the products of France's new steel mills, mines and factories.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 471\u201374</ref>\n\n====Development of steamships and early reconstruction on Paris====\n[[File:Travaux nocturnes des constructions de la rue de Rivoli, \u00e9clair\u00e9s par la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique.jpg|thumb|Enormous public works projects reconstructed the center of Paris. Here, work to extend the Rue de Rivoli continues at night by electric light (1854).]]\n\nNew shipping lines were created and ports rebuilt in [[Marseille]] and [[Le Havre]], which connected France by sea to the US, Latin America, North Africa and the Far East. During the Empire, the number of steamships tripled, and by 1870, France possessed the second-largest maritime fleet in the world after England.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 475</ref> Napoleon III backed the greatest maritime project of the age, the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] between 1859 and 1869. The canal project was funded by shares on the [[Paris Bourse|Paris stock market]] and led by a former French diplomat, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. It was opened by the Empress [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie]] with a performance of [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]].''<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 474</ref>\n\nThe rebuilding of central Paris also encouraged commercial expansion and innovation. The first department store, [[Bon March\u00e9]], opened in Paris in 1852 in a modest building and expanded rapidly, its income increasing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Its founder, [[Aristide Boucicaut]], commissioned a new glass and iron building designed by [[Louis-Charles Boileau]] and [[Gustave Eiffel]] that opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern [[department store]]. Other department stores quickly appeared: [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865 and [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 486</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's program also included reclaiming farmland and reforestation. One such project in the [[Gironde|Gironde department]] drained and reforested 10,000 square kilometers (3,900 square miles) of moorland, creating the [[Landes forest]], the largest maritime pine forest in Europe.\n\n===Reconstruction of Paris (1854\u20131870)===\n{{Main|Haussmann's renovation of Paris}}\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Avenue de l'Opera - Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts Reims.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra]], one of the new boulevards created by Napoleon III. The new buildings on the boulevards were required to be all of the same height and same basic facade design, and all faced with cream coloured stone, giving the city center its distinctive harmony.]]\nNapoleon III began his regime by launching a series of enormous public works projects in Paris, hiring tens of thousands of workers to improve the sanitation, water supply and traffic circulation of the city. To direct this task, he named a new prefect of the [[Seine department]], [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], and gave him extraordinary powers to rebuild the center of the city. He installed a large map of Paris in a central position in his office, and he and Haussmann planned the new Paris.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with neither an increase in its area nor a development of its structure of very narrow medieval streets and alleys.\n\nTo accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the center by the construction of new boulevards and squares, Napoleon III issued a decree in 1860 to [[Municipal annexation|annex]] eleven [[Communes of France|communes]] (municipalities) on the outskirts of Paris and increase the number of [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]] (city boroughs) from twelve to twenty. Paris was thus enlarged to its modern boundaries with the exception of the two major city parks ([[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]]) that only became part of the French capital in 1920.\n\nFor the duration of Napoleon III's reign and a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an enormous construction site. His hydraulic chief engineer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand]], built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the [[Vanne (river)|Vanne River]] in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne region]], and a new huge reservoir near the future [[Parc Montsouris]]. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic meters of water a day.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice (2009), ''Les jardins du Baron Haussmann'' p. 21</ref> Hundreds of kilometers of pipes distributed the water throughout the city, and a second network, using the less-clean water from the [[Ourcq]] and the [[Seine]], washed the streets and watered the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the [[Paris sewers]] and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new [[streetlight]]s along the Paris streets.<ref>Milza, 2006</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1854, in the center of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and constructed new avenues to connect the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height, constructed in a architectural similar style, and be faced with cream-coloured stone to create the signature look of Paris boulevards.\n\nNapoleon III built two new railway stations: the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1855) and the [[Gare du Nord]] (1865). He completed [[Les Halles]], the great cast iron and glass pavilioned produce market in the center of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]], in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the [[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]. The signature architectural landmark was the [[Paris Opera]], the largest theater in the world, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] to crown the center of Napoleon III's new Paris.<ref>Ayers, Andrew (2004). ''The Architecture of Paris''. Stuttgart; London: Edition Axel Menges. {{ISBN|978-3-930698-96-7}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\">Jarrasse, Dominique (2007), ''Grammaire des jardins parisiens'', Parigramme</ref>\n\nNapoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially [[Hyde Park (London)|Hyde Park]], where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile; but he wanted to build on a much larger scale. Working with Haussmann and [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the engineer who headed the new Service of Promenades and Plantations, he laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city. Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds and trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III transformed the [[Bois de Boulogne]] into a park (1852\u201358) to the west of Paris. To the east, he created the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1860\u201365), and to the north, the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] (1865\u201367). The [[Parc Montsouris]] (1865\u201378) was created to the south.<ref name=\"Jarrasse, Dominique 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to building the four large parks, Napoleon had the city's older parks, including the [[Parc Monceau]], formerly owned by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans family]], and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], refurbished and replanted. He also created some twenty small parks and gardens in the neighbourhoods as miniature versions of his large parks. Alphand termed these small parks \"green and flowering salons\". The intention of Napoleon's plan was to have one park in each of the eighty \"quartiers\" (neighbourhoods) of Paris, so that no one was more than a ten-minute walk from such a park. The parks were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.<ref>Jarrasse, Dominque (2007), Grammmaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme. p. 134</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adolphe Yvon - Haussmann pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'Empereur le plan d'annexion des Communes.jpg|[[Baron Haussmann]] and Napoleon III make official the annexation of eleven communes around Paris to the City.

He was still attached to his companion [[Harriet Howard]], who attended receptions at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] and traveled around France with him. He quietly sent a diplomatic delegation to approach the family of Princess [[Carola of Vasa]], the granddaughter of deposed King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]]. They declined because of his Catholic religion and the political uncertainty about his future, as did the family of [[Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], a niece of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nLouis-Napoleon finally announced that he found the right woman: a Spaniard called [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eug\u00e9nie du Derje de Montijo]], age 23, 20th [[Count of Teba|Countess of Teba]] and 15th Marchioness of [[Ardales]]. She received much of her education in Paris. Her beauty attracted Louis-Napoleon, who, as was his custom, tried to seduce her, but Eug\u00e9nie told him to wait for marriage. The civil ceremony took place at [[Tuileries Palace]] on 22 January 1853, and a much grander ceremony was held a few days later at the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In 1856, Eug\u00e9nie gave birth to a son and heir-apparent, [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 199\u2013204</ref>\n\n[[File:Empress Eugenie with her son 1862.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e9nie and the Prince Imperial in 1862]]\n\nWith an heir to the throne secured, Napoleon III resumed his \"petites distractions\" with other women. Eug\u00e9nie faithfully performed the duties of an empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the Emperor to balls, opera, and theater. She traveled to Egypt to open the [[Suez Canal]] and officially represented him whenever he traveled outside France.\n\nThough a fervent Catholic and conservative on many other issues, she strongly advocated equality for women. She pressured the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]] to give the first [[baccalaur\u00e9at|baccalaureate]] diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] to elect the writer [[George Sand]] as its first female member.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 204\u201310</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy (1852\u20131860)==\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world as a supporter of [[popular sovereignty]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>John B.

He was, however, determined to follow a strong foreign policy to extend France's influence and warned that he would not stand by and allow another European power to threaten its neighbour.\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, he was also an advocate of a new \"principle of nationalities\" (''principe des nationalit\u00e9s'') that supported the creation of new states [[nation-state|based on nationality]], such as Italy, in place of the old multinational empires, such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (or [[Empire of Austria]], known since 1867 as [[Austria-Hungary]]). In this he was influenced by his uncle's policy as described in the ''M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne''. In all of his foreign policy ventures, he put the interests of France first. Napoleon III felt that new states created on the basis of national identity would become natural allies and partners of France.<ref>Roger Price, ''The French Second Empire: an anatomy of political power'' (2001) p. 43</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Britain and the Crimean War (1853\u20131856)===\n{{Main|Crimean War}}\n[[File:William Simpson - Attack on the Malakoff.jpg|thumb|The French capture of Russian positions around [[Sevastopol]] brought the end of the [[Crimean War]].]]\n\n[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] as Britain's foreign minister and prime minister had close personal ties with leading French statesmen, notably Napoleon III himself.

[[John Thadeus Delane|John Delane]], editor of ''[[The Times]]'', visited France in January 1853 and was impressed by its military preparedness. He expressed his conviction that \"Louis-Napoleon was resolved on a forward foreign policy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/palmerstons-follies-a-reply-to-the-french-threat/|title='Palmerston's Follies': a reply to the French 'threat'|last=Hicks|first=Peter|date=2016|website=NAPOLEON.org \u2013 The History Website of the Fondation Napoleon|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Napoleon III was actually determined to increase the country\u2019s naval power. The first purpose-built steam-powered battleship (worryingly christened after [[French battleship Napol\u00e9on|Napoleon I]]) was launched in 1850, and the fortification of [[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] was strengthened. This led to the extension of the breakwater of [[Alderney]] and the construction of [[Fort Clonque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423|title=Fort Clonque Alderney, Channel Islands|date=2018|website=The Landmark Trust|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start of his Empire, Napoleon III sought an alliance with Britain. He had lived there while in exile and saw Britain as a natural partner in the projects he wished to accomplish. An opportunity soon presented itself: In early 1853, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] put pressure on the weak [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] government, demanding that the [[Ottoman Empire]] give Russia a protectorate over the Christian countries of the [[Balkans]] as well as control over [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]]. The Ottoman Empire, backed by Britain and France, refused Russia's demands, and a joint British-French fleet was sent to support the Ottoman Empire. When Russia refused to leave the [[Romania|Romanian territories]] it had occupied, Britain and France declared war on 27 March 1854.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\">Milza, 2006, pp. 382\u201386</ref>\n\nIt took France and Britain six months to organize a full-scale military expedition to the [[Black Sea]]. The Anglo-French fleet landed thirty thousand French and twenty thousand British soldiers in the [[Crimea]] on 14 September and began to [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)|lay siege]] to the major Russian port of [[Sevastopol]]. As the siege dragged on, the French and British armies were reinforced and troops from the Kingdom of Sardinia joined them, reaching a total of 140,000 soldiers, but they suffered terribly from epidemics of [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], and [[cholera]]. During the 332 days of the siege, the French lost 95,000 soldiers, including 75,000 due to disease. The suffering of the army in the Crimea was carefully concealed from the French public by press censorship.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 388\u201389</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtine de Malakoff, 8 septembre 1855 par Adolphe Yvon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Malakoff]], 8 September 1855]]\nThe death of Tsar Nicholas I on 2 March 1855 and his replacement by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] changed the political equation. In September, after a massive bombardment, the Anglo-French army of fifty thousand men stormed the Russian positions, and the Russians were forced to evacuate Sevastopol. Alexander II sought a political solution, and negotiations were held in Paris in the new building of the French Foreign Ministry on the [[Quai d'Orsay]], from 25 February to 8 April 1856.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 382-386\"/>\n\nThe Crimean War added three new place names to Paris: [[Pont de l'Alma|Alma]], named for the first French victory on the river of that name; [[Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol|Sevastopol]]; and [[Malakoff]], named for a tower in the center of the Russian line [[Battle of Malakoff|captured by the French]]. The war had two important diplomatic consequences: Alexander II became an ally of France, and Britain and France were reconciled. In April 1855, Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie went to England and were received by the Queen; in turn, Victoria and Prince Albert visited Paris. Victoria was the first British monarch to do so in centuries.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 392\u201395</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Russia and the alliance with Britain gave France increased authority and prestige in Europe. This was the first war between European powers since the close of the Napoleonic Wars and the [[Congress of Vienna]], marking a breakdown of the alliance system that had maintained peace for nearly half a century. The war also effectively ended the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]], or \"Waterloo Coalition,\" that the other four powers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain) had established. The [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Conference of 1856]] represented a high-water mark for Napoleon's regime in foreign affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=199}}</ref> It encouraged Napoleon III to make an even bolder foreign policy venture in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

A group of conspirators threw three bombs at the royal carriage as it made its way to the opera. Eight members of the escort and bystanders were killed and over one hundred people injured. The culprits were quickly arrested. The leader was an Italian nationalist, [[Felice Orsini]], who was aided by a French surgeon [[Simon Fran\u00e7ois Bernard|Simon Bernard]]. They believed that if Napoleon III were killed, a republican revolt would immediately follow in France, and the new republican government would help all Italian states win independence from Austria and achieve national unification. Bernard was in London at the time. Since he was a political exile, the British government refused to extradite him, but Orsini was tried, convicted and executed on 13 March 1858. The bombing focused the attention of France, and particularly of Napoleon III, on the issue of Italian nationalism.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 407\u201312</ref>\n\nPart of Italy, particularly the kingdom of [[Piedmont]]-[[Sardinia]] (officially the \"Kingdom of Sardinia\"), was independent, but central Italy was still ruled by the Pope (in this era, [[Pope Pius IX and Italy|Pope Pius IX]]), while [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy]] and much of the north was [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|ruled by Austria]]. Other states were [[de jure]] independent (e.g. the [[Duchy of Parma]] or the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]) but [[de facto]] totally under Austrian influence. Napoleon III had fought with the Italian patriots against the Austrians when he was young, and his sympathy was with them, but the Empress, most of his government and the Catholic Church in France supported the Pope and the existing governments. The British Government was also hostile to the idea of promoting nationalism in Italy. Despite the opposition in his government and in his own palace, Napoleon III did all that he could to support the cause of Piedmont-Sardinia. The King of Piedmont-Sardinia, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], was invited to Paris in November 1855, and given the same royal treatment as Queen Victoria.\n\n[[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Count Cavour]], the Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, came to Paris with the King and employed an unusual emissary in his efforts to win the support of Napoleon III: his beautiful young cousin, [[Virginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione]] (1837\u201399). As Cavour had hoped, she caught his eye and became his mistress. Between 1855 and 1857, she used the opportunity to pass messages and to plead the Italian cause.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 357\u201362</ref>\n\nIn July 1858, Napoleon arranged a secret visit by Count Cavour. They agreed to join forces and drive the Austrians from Italy. In exchange, Napoleon III asked for Savoy (the ancestral land of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia) and the then bilingual county of Nice, which had been taken from France after Napoleon's fall in 1815 and given to Piedmont-Sardinia. Cavour protested that Nice was Italian, but Napoleon responded that \"these are secondary questions. There will be time later to discuss them.\"<ref>cited in Milza, 2006, p. 414</ref>\n\nAssured of the support of Napoleon III, Count Cavour began to prepare the army of Piedmont-Sardinia for war against Austria. Napoleon III looked for diplomatic support. He approached [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and the British Government; Britain was against the war, but agreed to remain neutral. Still facing strong opposition within his own government, Napoleon III offered to negotiate a diplomatic solution with the twenty-eight-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] in the spring of 1858. The Austrians demanded the disarmament of Piedmont-Sardinia first, and sent a fleet with thirty thousand soldiers to reinforce their garrisons in Italy. Napoleon III responded on 26 January 1859 by signing a treaty of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia. Napoleon promised to send two hundred thousand soldiers to help one hundred thousand soldiers from Piedmont-Sardinia to force the Austrians out of northern Italy; in return, France would receive the county of Nice and Savoy provided that their populations would agree in a referendum.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 415\u201320</ref>\n\nIt was the Emperor Franz Joseph, growing impatient, who finally unleashed the war. On 23 April 1859, he sent an ultimatum to the government of Piedmont-Sardinia demanding that they stop their military preparations and disband their army. On 26 April, Count Cavour rejected the demands, and on 27 April, the Austrian army invaded Piedmont.\n\n====War in Italy \u2013 Magenta and Solferino (1859)====\n[[File:Yvon Bataille de Solferino Compiegne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Napoleon III with the French forces at the [[Battle of Solferino]], which secured the Austrian withdrawal from Italy. He was horrified by the casualties, and ended the war soon after the battle.]]\n\nNapoleon III, though he had very little military experience, decided to lead the French army in Italy himself. Part of the French army crossed over the Alps, while the other part, with the Emperor, landed in [[Genoa]] on 18 May 1859. Fortunately for Napoleon and the Piedmontese, the commander of the Austrians, General Giulay, was not very aggressive. His forces greatly outnumbered the Piedmontese army at Turin, but he hesitated, allowing the French and Piedmontese to unite their forces.\n\nNapoleon III wisely left the fighting to his professional generals. The first great battle of the war, on 4 June 1859, [[Battle of Magenta|was fought]] at the town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]]. It was long and bloody, and the French center was exhausted and nearly broken, but the battle was finally won by a timely attack on the Austrian flank by the soldiers of General MacMahon. The Austrians had seven thousand men killed and five thousand captured, while the French forces had four thousand men killed. The battle was largely remembered because, soon after it was fought, patriotic chemists in France gave the name of the battle to their newly discovered bright purple chemical dye; the dye and the colour took the name [[magenta]].<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 425</ref>\n\nThe rest of the Austrian army was able to escape while Napoleon III and King Victor Emmanuel made a triumphal entry on 10 June into the city of [[Milan]], previously ruled by the Austrians. They were greeted by huge, jubilant crowds waving Italian and French flags.\n\nThe Austrians had been driven from Lombardy, but the army of General Giulay remained in the region of Venice. His army had been reinforced and numbered 130,000 men, roughly the same as the French and Piedmontese, though the Austrians were superior in artillery. On 24 June, the [[Battle of Solferino|second and decisive battle]] was fought at [[Solferino]]. This battle was even longer and bloodier than Magenta. In confused and often ill-directed fighting, there were approximately forty thousand casualties, including 11,500 French. Napoleon III was horrified by the thousands of dead and wounded on the battlefield. He proposed an armistice to the Austrians, which was accepted on 8 July. A formal treaty ending the war was signed on 11 July 1859.<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 427\u201328</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVoSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Armistice+of+Villafranca#v=onepage&q=Armistice%20of%20Villafranca&f=false|title=Italy in the Age of the Risorgimento 1790\u20131870|last=Hearder|first=Harry|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317872061|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCount Cavour and the Piedmontese were bitterly disappointed by the abrupt end of the war. Lombardy had been freed, but [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Venetia]] (the Venice region) was still controlled by the Austrians, and the Pope was still the ruler of Rome and Central Italy. Cavour angrily resigned his post. Napoleon III returned to Paris on 17 July, and a huge parade and celebration were held on 14 August, in front of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me column]], the symbol of the glory of Napoleon I. Napoleon III celebrated the day by granting a general amnesty to the political prisoners and exiles he had chased from France.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 431</ref>\n\nIn Italy, even without the French army, the process of Italian unification launched by Cavour and Napoleon III took on a momentum of its own. There were uprisings in central Italy and the Papal states, and Italian patriots, led by Garibaldi, [[Expedition of the Thousand|invaded and took over]] Sicily, which would lead to the collapse of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Napoleon III wrote to the Pope and suggested that he \"make the sacrifice of your provinces in revolt and confide them to Victor Emmanuel\". The Pope, furious, declared in a public address that Napoleon III was a \"liar and a cheat\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 260</ref> Rome and the surrounding [[Latium]] region remained in Papal hands, and therefore did not immediately become the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Italy, and Venetia was still occupied by the Austrians, but the rest of Italy had come under the rule of Victor Emmanuel.\n\nAs Cavour had promised, Savoy and the county of Nice were annexed by France in 1860 after referendums, although it is disputed how fair they were. In Nice, 25,734 voted for union with France, just 260 against, but Italians still called for its return into the 20th century. On 18 February 1861, the first Italian parliament met in Turin, and on 23 March, Victor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of Italy. Count Cavour died a few weeks later, declaring that \"Italy is made.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 434\u201341</ref>\n\nNapoleon's support for the Italian patriots and his confrontation with Pope Pius IX over who would govern Rome made him unpopular with fervent French Catholics, and even with Empress Eug\u00e9nie, who was a fervent Catholic. To win over the French Catholics and his wife, he agreed to guarantee that Rome would remain under the Pope and independent from the rest of Italy, and agreed to keep French troops there. The capital of Italy became Turin (in 1861) then Florence (in 1865), not Rome. However, in 1862, Garibaldi gathered an army to march on Rome, under the slogan, \"Rome or death\".{{sfn|Briggs|Clavin|2003|page=97}} To avoid a confrontation between Garibaldi and the French soldiers, the Italian government [[Battle of Aspromonte|sent its own soldiers]] to face them, arrested Garibaldi and put him in prison. Napoleon III sought, but was unable to find, a diplomatic solution that would allow him to withdraw French troops from Rome while guaranteeing that the city would remain under Papal control.\n[[File:CousinMontaubanCampaignOf1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Cousin-Montauban, Comte de Palikao|Cousin-Montauban]] leading French forces during the [[Second Opium War|Anglo-French expedition to China]]]]\n\nGaribaldi made another attempt to capture Rome in November 1867, but was defeated by the French and Papal troops near the town of [[Mentana]] on 3 November 1867.\n\nThe garrison of eight thousand French troops remained in Rome until August 1870, when they were recalled at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In September 1870, Garibaldi's soldiers finally entered Rome and made it the capital of Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 325\u201328</ref>\n\nAfter the successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and the annexation of Savoy and Nice to the territory of France, the Continental foreign policy of Napoleon III entered a calmer period. Expeditions to distant corners of the world and the expansion of the Empire replaced major changes in the map of Europe. The Emperor's health declined; he gained weight, he began to dye his hair to cover the gray, he walked slowly because of [[gout]], and in 1864, at the military camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne]], he suffered the first medical crisis from his [[gallstones]], the ailment that killed him nine years later. He was less engaged in governing and less attentive to detail, but still sought opportunities to increase French commerce and prestige globally.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 309\u201310</ref>\n\n===Overseas empire===\n{{main|French colonial empire#Napoleon III: 1852\u20131870}}\n\n====Establishing a Mexican empire====\n[[File:Arrival of Marshal Randon in Algier-Ernest-Francis Vacherot mg 5120.jpg|thumb|Arrival of Marshal [[Jacques Louis Randon|Randon]] in [[Algiers]] in 1857]]\n\nIn 1862, Napoleon III [[French intervention in Mexico|sent troops]] to Mexico in an effort to establish an allied monarchy in the Americas, with Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] enthroned as [[Emperor of Mexico|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]]. The [[Second Mexican Empire]] faced resistance from the republican government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], however. After victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States made clear that France would have to leave. It sent 50,000 troops under General [[Philip H. Sheridan]] to the U.S.-Mexico border and helped resupply Ju\u00e1rez. Napoleon's military was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew his troops from Mexico in 1866. Maximilian was overthrown and executed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Don H.

Additionally, France had a [[sphere of influence]] during the 19th century and early 20th century in southern China, including a naval base at Kuangchow Bay ([[Guangzhouwan]]).<ref>[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Protectorates-and-Spheres-of-Influence-Spheres-of-influence-prior-to-world-war-ii.html \"Protectorates and Spheres of Influence \u2013 Spheres of influence prior to World War II\"] ''Encyclopedia of the New American Nation''</ref>\n\n==Life at the court of Napoleon III==\n[[File:PierreTetarVanElvenF\u00eateAuxTuileries10juin1867.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Tuileries Palace]] during the gala soir\u00e9e of 10 June 1867, hosted by Napoleon III for the sovereigns attending the [[Paris International Exhibition of 1867]].]]\n\nFollowing the model of the Kings of France and of his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, Napoleon III moved his official residence to the [[Tuileries Palace]], where he had a suite of rooms on the ground floor of the south wing between the Seine and the [[Pavillon de l'Horloge]] (Clock pavilion), facing the garden.\n\nThe French word ''tuileries'' denotes \"[[brickworks]]\" or \"[[tile]]-making works\". The palace was given that name because the neighbourhood in which it had been built in 1564 was previously known for its numerous mason and tiler businesses.\n\nNapoleon III's bedroom was decorated with a talisman from [[Charlemagne]] (a symbol of good luck for the Bonaparte family), while his office featured a portrait of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Ingres]] and a large map of Paris that he used to show his ideas for the reconstruction of Paris to his prefect of the Seine department, [[Baron Haussmann]]. The Emperor's rooms were overheated and were filled with smoke, as he smoked cigarette after cigarette. The Empress occupied a suite of rooms just above his, highly decorated in the style of Louis XVI with a pink salon, a green salon and a blue salon.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 200\u201301</ref>\n\nThe court moved with the Emperor and Empress from palace to palace each year following a regular calendar. At the beginning of May, the Emperor and court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]] for outdoor activities in the park. In June and July, they moved with selected guests to the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] for walks in the forest and boating on the lake. In July, the court moved to thermal baths for a health cure, first to [[Plombi\u00e8res]], then to [[Vichy]], and then, after 1856, to the military camp and residence built at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] (nowadays: Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne), where Napoleon could take the waters and review military parades and exercises. Beginning in 1856, the Emperor and Empress spent each September in [[Biarritz]] in the [[Villa Eug\u00e9nie]], a large villa overlooking the sea.<ref>[http://thegrandhotelsoftheworld.com/palais/ \"History of the Hotel du Palais, the former Villa Eugenie\"]. Grand Hotels of the World.com</ref> They would walk on the beach or travel to the mountains, and in the evenings they would dance and sing and play cards and take part in other games and amateur theatricals and charades with their guests. In November, the court moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] for forest excursions, dancing and more games. Famous scientists and artists, such as [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and Giuseppe [[Verdi]], were invited to participate in the festivities at Compi\u00e8gne.<ref>Girard, 1986, pp. 202\u201304</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year the Emperor and Court returned to the Tuileries Palace and gave a series of formal receptions and three or four grand balls with six hundred guests early in the new year. Visiting dignitaries and monarchs were frequently invited. During [[Carnival]], there were a series of very elaborate costume balls on the themes of different countries and different historical periods, for which guests sometimes spent small fortunes on their costumes.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{main|Napoleon III style|Paris during the Second Empire}}\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|When [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and other [[avant-garde]] paintings were rejected by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1863, Napoleon III ordered that the works be displayed, so that the public could judge for themselves.]]\n\nNapoleon III had conservative and traditional taste in art: his favourite painters were [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], who received major commissions, and whose work was purchased for state museums. At the same time, he followed public opinion, and he made an important contribution to the French [[avant-garde]]. In 1863, the jury of the [[Paris Salon]], the famous annual showcase of French painting, headed by the ultra-conservative director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Count  [[\u00c9milien de Nieuwerkerke]], refused all submissions by avant-garde artists, including those by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The artists and their friends complained, and the complaints reached Napoleon III. His office issued a statement: \"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\"<ref>Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863.

More than a thousand visitors a day came to see now-famous paintings such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. '<ref>Meneglier, Herv\u00e9, ''Paris Imp\u00e9rial \u2013 la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire''</ref> The journalist [[\u00c9mile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galeries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter and mocking comments of many of the spectators. While the paintings were ridiculed by many critics and visitors, the work of the avant-garde became known for the first time to the French public, and it took its place alongside the more traditional style of painting.<ref>Meneglier, Herv\u00e9, ''Paris Imp\u00e9rial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' \u00c9ditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Napoleon III commissioned [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]] to restore the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]] in 1853.]]\nNapoleon III also began or completed the restoration of several important historic landmarks, carried out for him by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. He restored the [[fl\u00e8che]], or spire, of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], which had been partially destroyed and desecrated during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1855, he completed the restoration, begun in 1845, of the stained glass windows of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], and in 1862, he declared it a national historical monument. In 1853, he approved and provided funding for Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the medieval town of [[Carcassonne]]. He also sponsored Viollet-le-Duc's restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], In 1862, he closed the prison which had occupied the Abbey of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] since the French Revolution, where many important political prisoners had been held, so it could be restored and opened to the public.\n\n==Social and economic policies==\n\n===Social policy and reforms===\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Napoleon III launched a series of social reforms aimed at improving the life of the working class. He began with small projects, such as opening up two clinics in Paris for sick and injured workers, a program of legal assistance to those unable to afford it, and subsidies to companies that built low-cost housing for their workers. He outlawed the practice of employers taking possession of or making comments in the work document that every employee was required to carry; negative comments meant that workers were unable to get other jobs. In 1866, he encouraged the creation of a state insurance fund to help workers or peasants who became disabled, and to help their widows and families.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 314</ref>\n\nTo help the working class, Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could develop an inexpensive substitute for butter; the prize was won by the French chemist [[Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s]], who in 1869 patented a product he named oleomargarine, later shortened simply to [[margarine]].<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 313</ref>\n\n====Rights to strike and organize (1864\u20131866)====\n\nHis most important social reform was the 1864 law that gave French workers the right to strike, which had been forbidden since 1810. In 1866, he added to this an \"Edict of Tolerance,\" which gave factory workers the right to organize. He issued a decree regulating the treatment of apprentices, limited working hours on Sundays and holidays, and removed from the [[Napoleonic Code]] the infamous article 1781, which said that the declaration of the employer, even without proof, would be given more weight by the court than the word of the employee.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 314\u201317</ref>\n\n====Education for girls and women, and school reform (1861\u20131869)====\n[[File:J.V Daubi\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In 1861, through the direct intervention of the Emperor and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, [[Julie-Victoire Daubi\u00e9]] became the first woman to receive a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma.]]\n\nNapoleon III and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie worked to give girls and women greater access to public education. In 1861, through the direct intervention of the Emperor and the Empress, [[Julie-Victoire Daubi\u00e9]] became the first woman in France to receive the [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Viviani, Henri Robert and Albert Meurg\u00e9 ''Cinquante-ans de f\u00e9minisme : 1870\u20131920'', Ligue fran\u00e7aise pour le droit des femmes, Paris, 1921</ref> In 1862, the first professional school for young women was opened, and [[Madeleine Br\u00e8s]] became the first woman to enroll in the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Paris]].\n\nIn 1863, he made [[Victor Duruy]], the son of a factory worker and a respected historian, his new Minister of Public Education. Duruy accelerated the pace of the reforms, often coming into conflict with the Catholic church, which wanted the leading role in education. Despite the opposition of the church, Duruy opened schools for girls in each commune with more than five hundred residents, a total of eight hundred new schools.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\">Milza, 2006, p. 592</ref>\n\n[[File:Victorduruy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Victor Duruy]], Napol\u00e9on III's Minister of Public Education from 1863 to 1869, created schools for girls in every commune of France and women were admitted for the first time to medical school and to the [[Sorbonne]].]]\nBetween 1863 and 1869, Duruy created scholastic libraries for fifteen thousand schools and required that primary schools offer courses in history and geography. Secondary schools began to teach philosophy, which had been banned by the previous regime at the request of the Catholic church. For the first time, public schools in France began to teach contemporary history, modern languages, art, gymnastics and music. The results of the school reforms were dramatic: in 1852, over 40 percent of army conscripts in France were unable to read or write, yet by 1869, the number had dropped to 25 percent. The rate of illiteracy among both girls and boys dropped to 32 percent.\n<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 592\"/>\n\nAt the university level, Napoleon III founded new faculties in [[Marseille]], [[Douai]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]] and [[Poitiers]] and founded a network of research institutes of higher studies in the sciences, history, and economics. These also were criticized by the Catholic Church. The Cardinal-Archbishop of Rouen, [[Henri-Marie-Gaston Boisnormand de Bonnechose|Monseigneur Bonnechose]], wrote, \"True science is religious, while false science, on the other hand, is vain and prideful; being unable to explain God, it rebels against him.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 598</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\n\n====Lower tariffs and the opening of French markets (1860)====\nOne of the centerpieces of the economic policy of Napoleon III was the lowering of tariffs and the opening of French markets to imported goods. He had been in Britain in 1846 when Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] had lowered tariffs on imported grains, and he had seen the benefits to British consumers and the British economy. However, he faced bitter opposition from many French industrialists and farmers, who feared British competition. Convinced he was right, he sent his chief economic advisor, [[Michel Chevalier]], to London to begin discussions, and secretly negotiated a [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|new commercial agreement]] with Britain, calling for the gradual lowering of tariffs in both countries. He signed the treaty, without consulting with the Assembly, on 23 January 1860. Four hundred of the top industrialists in France came to Paris to protest, but he refused to yield. Industrial tariffs on such products as steel rails for railways were lowered first; tariffs on grains were not lowered until June 1861. Similar agreements were negotiated with the Netherlands, Italy, and France's other neighbors. France's industries were forced to modernize and become more efficient to compete with the British, as Napoleon III had intended. Commerce between the countries surged.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 241\u201343</ref>\n\n====Economic expansion and social change====\nBy the 1860s, the huge state investment in railways, infrastructure and fiscal policies of Napoleon III had brought dramatic changes to the French economy and French society. French people travelled in greater numbers, more often and farther than they had ever travelled before. The opening of the first public school libraries by Napoleon III and the opening by [[Louis Hachette]] of the first bookstores in Napoleon's new train stations led to the wider circulation of books around France.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 304</ref>\n\nDuring the Empire, industrial production increased by 73 percent, growing twice as rapidly as that of the United Kingdom, though its total output remained lower. From 1850 to 1857, the French economy grew at a pace of five percent a year and exports grew by sixty percent between 1855 and 1869.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 306\u201307</ref>\n\nFrench agricultural production increased by sixty percent, spurred by new farming techniques taught at the agricultural schools started in each [[Departments of France|Department]] by Napoleon III, and new markets opened by the railways. The threat of famine, which for centuries had haunted the French countryside, receded. The last recorded famine in France was in 1855.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe pp. 306-307\"/>\n\nDuring the Empire, the migration of the rural population to the cities increased. The portion of the population active in agriculture dropped from 61 percent in 1851 to 54 percent in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\">S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 309</ref>\n\nThe average salary of French workers grew by 45 percent during the Second Empire, but only kept up with price inflation. On the other hand, more French people than ever were able to save money; the number of bank accounts grew from 742,889 in 1852 to 2,079,141 in 1870.<ref name=\"S\u00e9guin, Philippe p. 309\"/>\n\n====Growing opposition and liberal concessions (1860\u20131870)====\nDespite the economic progress the country had made, domestic opposition to Napoleon III was slowly growing, particularly in the ''[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]]'' (Parliament). The republicans on the left had always opposed him, believing he had usurped power and suppressed the Republic. The conservative Catholics were increasingly unhappy, because he had abandoned the Pope in his struggle to retain political control of the Papal States and had built up a public education system that was a rival to the Catholic system. Many businessmen, particularly in the metallurgical and textile industries, were unhappy, because he had reduced the tariffs on British products, putting the British products in direct competition with their own. The members of Parliament were particularly unhappy with him for dealing with them only when he needed money. When he had liberalized trade with England, he had not even consulted them.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 345\u201346</ref>\n\nNapoleon's large-scale program of public works, and his expensive foreign policy, had created rapidly mounting government debts; the annual deficit was about 100 million gold-francs, and the cumulative debt had reached nearly 1,000 million gold-francs (1 billion in US readings). The Emperor needed to restore the confidence of the business world and to involve the legislature and have them share responsibility.\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 002.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III in 1865]]\n[[File:Ten centimes 1855.JPG|thumb|Ten [[centime]] coin, 1855]]\nOn 24 December 1861, Napoleon III, against the opposition of his own ministers, issued a decree announcing that the legislature would have greater powers. The Senate and the Assembly could, for the first time, give a response to the Emperor's program, ministers were obliged to defend their programs before the Assembly, and the right of [[Deputy (France)|Deputies]] to amend the programs was enlarged. On 1 February 1861, further reforms were announced: Deputies could speak from the tribune, not just from their seats, and a stenographic record would be made and published of each session. Another even more important reform was announced on 31 December 1861: the budget of each ministry would be voted section by section, not in a block, and the government could no longer spend money by special decree when the legislature was not in session. He did retain the right to change the budget estimates section by section.\n\nThe Deputies quickly took advantage of their new rights; the Emperor's Italian policy was bitterly condemned in Parliament, and anti-government amendments by the pro-Catholic deputies were defeated by votes of 158 to 91 in the ''Corps l\u00e9gislatif'' and 79 to 61 in the Senate.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, pp. 346\u201347</ref>\n\nIn the legislative elections of 31 May 1863, the pro-government candidates received 5,308,000 votes, while the opposition received 1,954,000 votes, three times more than in the previous elections. The rural departments still voted for Napoleon III's candidates, but in Paris, 63 percent of the votes went to anti-government republican candidates, with similar numbers in all the large cities. The new Assembly contained a large opposition block ranging from Catholics outraged by the Papal policies to [[Legitimists]], [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s, [[protectionism|protectionists]] and republicans, armed with new powers given to them by the Emperor himself.<ref>Alain Plessis, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Empire, 1852\u20131871'' (1988)</ref><ref>Milza, 2006, pp. 568\u201369</ref>\n\nDespite the opposition in the legislature, Napoleon III's reforms remained popular in the rest of the country. A new [[1870 French constitutional referendum|plebiscite was held in 1870]], on this text: \"The people approve the liberal reforms added to the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the agreement of the legislative bodies and ratified by the Senate on April 20, 1870.\" Napoleon III saw this as a referendum on his rule as Emperor: \"By voting yes,\" he wrote, \"you will chase away the threat of revolution; you will place the nation on a solid base of order and liberty, and you will make it easier to pass on the Crown to my son.\" When the votes were counted, Napoleon III had lost Paris and the other big cities but decisively won the rest of the country. The final vote was 7,336,434 votes yes, 1,560,709 votes no, and 1,900,000 abstentions. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], the leader of the republican opposition, wrote in despair, \"We were crushed. The Emperor is more popular than ever.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 370</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n\n===Declining health and rise of Prussia===\nThrough the 1860s, the health of the Emperor steadily worsened. It had been damaged by his six years in prison at Ham; he had chronic pains in his legs and feet, particularly when it was cold, and as a result, he always lived and worked in overheated rooms and offices. He smoked heavily. He distrusted doctors, disregarded medical advice and attributed any problems simply to \"rheumatism\", for which he regularly visited the hot springs at [[Vichy]] and other spas. It became difficult for him to ride a horse, and he was obliged to walk slowly, often with a cane. From 1869 onwards, the crises of his urinary tract were treated with [[opium]], which made him seem lethargic and apathetic. His writing became hard to read and his voice weak. In the spring of 1870, he was visited by an old friend from England, [[James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]. Malmesbury found him to be \"terribly changed and very ill\".<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 449</ref>\n\nThe health problems of the Emperor were kept secret by the government, which feared that, if his condition became public, the opposition would demand his abdication. One newspaper, the ''Courrier de la Vienne'', was warned by the censors to stop publishing articles which had \"a clear and malicious intent to spread, contrary to the truth, alarms about the health of the Emperor\".<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 338</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1870, a specialist in the problems of urinary tracts, [[Germain S\u00e9e]], was finally summoned to examine him. S\u00e9e reported that the Emperor was suffering from a [[gallstone]]. On 2 July, four eminent French doctors, N\u00e9laton, Ricord, Fauvel and Corvisart, examined him and confirmed the diagnosis. They were reluctant to operate, however, because of the high risk (gallstone operations did not become relatively safe until the 1880s) and because of the Emperor's weakness. Before anything further could be done, however, France was in the middle of a diplomatic crisis.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 450</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, [[Prussia]] appeared on the horizon as a new rival to French power in Europe. Its chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], had ambitions for Prussia to lead a [[German unification|unified Germany]]. In May 1862, Bismarck came to Paris on a diplomatic mission and met Napoleon III for the first time. They had cordial relations. On 30 September 1862, however, in Munich, Bismarck declared, in a famous speech: \"It is not by speeches and votes of the majority that the great questions of our period will be settled, as one believed in 1848, but by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|iron and blood]].\" Bismarck saw Austria and France as the main obstacles to his ambitions, and he set out to divide and defeat them.\n\n===Search for allies, and war between Austria and Prussia===\n\nIn the winter and spring of 1864, when the [[North German Confederation]] (and southern German allies) [[Second Schleswig War|invaded and occupied]] the German-speaking provinces of [[Denmark]] ([[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]), Napoleon III recognized the threat that a unified Germany would pose to France, and he looked for allies to challenge Germany, without success.\n\nThe British government was suspicious that Napoleon wanted to take over Belgium and Luxembourg, felt secure with its powerful navy, and did not want any military engagements on the European continent at the side of the French.\n\nThe Russian government was also suspicious of Napoleon, whom it believed had encouraged Polish nationalists to [[January Uprising|rebel against Russian rule]] in 1863. Bismarck and Prussia, on the other hand, had offered assistance to Russia to help crush the Polish patriots.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 376\u201377</ref>\n\nIn October 1865, Napoleon had a cordial meeting with Bismarck at [[Biarritz]]. They discussed Venetia, Austria's remaining province in Italy. Bismarck told Napoleon that Germany had no secret arrangement to give Venetia to Italy, and Napoleon assured him in turn that France had no secret understanding with Austria. Bismarck hinted vaguely that, in the event of a war between Austria and Prussia, French neutrality would be rewarded with some sort of territory as a compensation. Napoleon III had Luxembourg in mind.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 649</ref>\n\nIn 1866, relations between Austria and Prussia worsened and Bismarck demanded the expulsion of Austria from the German Confederation. Napoleon and his foreign minister, [[Drouyn de Lhuys]], expected a long war and an eventual Austrian victory. Napoleon III felt he could extract a price from both Prussia and Austria for French neutrality. On 12 June 1866, France signed a secret treaty with Austria, guaranteeing French neutrality in a Prussian-Austrian war. In exchange, in the event of an Austrian victory, Austria would give Venetia to France and would also create a new independent German state on the Rhine, which would become an ally of France. At the same time, Napoleon proposed a secret treaty with Bismarck, promising that France would remain neutral in a war between Austria and Prussia. In the event of a Prussian victory, France would recognize Prussia's annexation of smaller German states, and France, in exchange, would receive a portion of German territory, the [[Palatinate region]] north of Alsace. Bismarck, rightly confident of success due to the modernization of the [[Prussian Army]], summarily rejected Napoleon's offer.\n\nOn 15 June, the Prussian Army invaded [[Saxony]], an ally of Austria. On 2 July, Austria asked Napoleon to arrange an armistice between Italy, which had allied itself with Prussia, and Austria, in exchange for which France would receive Venetia. But on 3 July, the Prussian army crushed the Austrian army at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] in [[Bohemia]]. The way to Vienna was open for the Prussians, and Austria asked for an armistice. The armistice was signed on 22 July; Prussia annexed the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], the [[Electorate of Hesse-Kassel]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]] and the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], with a combined population of four million people.<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\">Girard, 1986, p. 380</ref>\n\nThe Austrian defeat was followed by a new crisis in the health of Napoleon III. [[Marshal Canrobert]], who saw him on 28 July, wrote that the Emperor \"was pitiful to see. He could barely sit up in his armchair, and his drawn face expressed at the same time moral anguish and physical pain.\"<ref name=\"Girard, 1986, p. 380\"/>\n\n===Luxembourg Crisis===\n{{Main|Luxembourg Crisis}}\nNapoleon III still hoped to receive some compensation from Prussia for French neutrality during the war. His foreign minister, Drouyn, asked Bismarck for the Palatinate region on the Rhine, which belonged to Bavaria, and for the demilitarization of Luxembourg, which was the site of a [[Fortress of Luxembourg|formidable fortress]] staffed by a strong Prussian garrison in accordance with international treaties. Napoleon's senior advisor [[Eug\u00e8ne Rouher]] increased the demands, asking that Prussia accept the annexation by France of Belgium and of Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg had regained its [[de jure]] independence in 1815 as a [[grand duchy]]. However, it was in [[personal union]] with the Netherlands. King [[William III of the Netherlands]], who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, desperately needed money and was prepared to sell the Grand Duchy to France. Bismarck swiftly intervened and showed the British ambassador a copy of Napoleon's demands; as a result, he put pressure on William III to refuse to sell Luxembourg to France. France was forced to renounce any claim to Luxembourg in the [[Treaty of London (1867)]]. Napoleon III gained nothing for his efforts but the demilitarization of the Luxembourg fortress.<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1975|p=203}}</ref>\n\n===Failure to increase the size of the French army===\nDespite his failing health, Napoleon III could see that the Prussian Army, combined with the armies of Bavaria and the other German states, would be a formidable enemy. In 1866, Prussia, with a population of 22 million, had been able to mobilize an army of 700,000 men, while France, with a population of 26 million, had an army of only 385,000 men, of whom 140,000 were in Algeria, Mexico, and Rome.<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 387</ref> In the autumn of 1867, Napoleon III proposed a form of universal military service similar to the Prussian system to increase the size of the French Army, if needed, to 1 million. His proposal was opposed by many French officers, such as [[Marshal Randon]], who preferred a smaller, more professional army; he said: \"This proposal will only give us recruits; it's soldiers we need.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 389</ref> It was also strongly opposed by the republican opposition in the French parliament, who denounced the proposal as a militarization of French society. The republican deputy, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], who later became Napoleon's prime minister, declared: \"The armies of France, which I always considered too large, are now going to be increased to an exorbitant size. Why? What is the necessity? Where is the danger? Who is threatening us? ...If France were to disarm, the Germans would know how to convince their governments to do the same. \"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 392</ref> Facing almost certain defeat in the parliament, Napoleon III withdrew the proposal. It was replaced in January 1868 by a much more modest project to create a ''garde mobile'', or reserve force, to support the army.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Howard|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870\u20131871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2wEeRuei6AC|year=1981|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=30, 38\u201339|isbn=9780203993057}}</ref>\n\n===A last search for allies===\nNapoleon III was overconfident in his military strength and went into war even after he failed to find any allies who would support a war to stop German unification.<ref>James D.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706889 online]</ref>\n \nFollowing the defeat of Austria, Napoleon resumed his search for allies against Prussia. In April 1867, he proposed an alliance, defensive and offensive, with Austria. If Austria joined France in a victorious war against Prussia, Napoleon promised that Austria could form a new confederation with the southern states of Germany and could annex [[Silesia]], while France took for its part the left bank of the [[Rhine River]]. But the timing of Napoleon's offer was poorly chosen; Austria was in the process of a [[Ausgleich|major internal reform]], creating a new twin monarchy structure with two components, one being the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] and the other being the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nNapoleon's attempt to install the archduke Maximilian, the brother of the Austrian Emperor, in Mexico was just coming to its disastrous conclusion; the French troops had just been withdrawn from Mexico in February 1867, and the unfortunate Maximilian would be captured, judged and shot by a firing squad on 19 June. Napoleon III made these offers again in August 1867, on a visit to offer condolences for the death of Maximilian, but the proposal was not received with enthusiasm.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Adolphe Yvon - Portrait of Napoleon III - Walters 3795.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Napoleon III in 1868 by [[Adolphe Yvon]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= The Walters Art Museum |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/597|title= Portrait of Napoleon III}}</ref>]]\nNapoleon III also made one last attempt to persuade Italy to be his ally against Prussia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel was personally favorable to a better relationship with France, remembering the role that Napoleon III had played in achieving Italian unification, but Italian public opinion was largely hostile to France; on 3 November 1867, French and Papal soldiers had fired upon the Italian patriots of Garibaldi, when he tried to capture Rome. Napoleon presented a proposed treaty of alliance on 4 June 1869, the anniversary of the joint French-Italian victory at Magenta. The Italians responded by demanding that France withdraw its troops who were protecting the Pope in Rome. Given the opinion of fervent French Catholics, this was a condition Napoleon III could not accept.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWhile Napoleon III was having no success finding allies, Bismarck signed secret military treaties with the southern German states, who promised to provide troops in the event of a war between Prussia and France. In 1868, Bismarck signed an accord with Russia that gave Russia liberty of action in the Balkans in exchange for neutrality in the event of a war between France and Prussia. This treaty put additional pressure on Austria, which also had interests in the Balkans, not to ally itself with France. Bismarck also reached out to the liberal government of [[William Gladstone]] in London, offering to protect the neutrality of Belgium against a French threat. The British Foreign Office under [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]] mobilized the British fleet, to dissuade France against any aggressive moves against Belgium. In any war between France and Prussia, France would be entirely alone.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\nBismarck thought that French vanity would lead to war; he exploited that vanity in the [[Ems Dispatch]] in July 1870. France took the bait and declared war on Prussia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alison Kitson|title=Germany 1858\u20131990: Hope, Terror and Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwyp6RYFNhsC&pg=PA1870|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=1870|isbn=978-0199134175}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, French politician [[Adolphe Thiers]] (who became President of the French Republic in 1871) accused Napoleon III of erroneous foreign policy: \"There is no mistake that can be made\".<ref>History of the XIX century (1848-1871). In 5 volumes. Under the editorship of professors of Lavisse and Rambaud. Second edition. Volume 5. Part 1. \u2013 M. p. 182</ref> Napoleon III and France in the summer of 1870, however, made a serious mistake when France declared war on Prussia. This allowed Bismarck and Prussia to present the war to the world as defensive, although Prussia and Bismarck had aggressive plans, and they soon became known in relation to the annexation of the French provinces of Alsace and [[Lorraine]].\n\n===Hohenzollern candidacy and the Ems telegram===\n{{Main|Ems Dispatch}}\nIn his memoirs, written long after the war, Bismarck wrote, \"I always considered that a war with France would naturally follow a war against Austria... I was convinced that the gulf which was created over time between the north and the south of Germany could not be better overcome than by a national war against the neighbouring people who were aggressive against us. I did not doubt that it was necessary to make a French-German war before the general reorganization of Germany could be realized.\"<ref>S\u00e9guin, 1990, p. 394</ref> As the summer of 1870 approached, pressure mounted on Bismarck to have a war with France as quickly as possible. In [[Bavaria]], the largest of the southern German states, unification with (mostly Protestant) Prussia was being opposed by the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Patriotic Party]], which favoured a confederacy of (Catholic) Bavaria with (Catholic) Austria. German Protestant public opinion was on the side of unification with Prussia.\n\nIn France, patriotic sentiment was also growing. On 8 May 1870, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869. The Emperor was less popular in Paris and the big cities, but highly popular in the French countryside. Napoleon had named a new foreign minister, Antoine Agenor, [[Agenor, duc de Gramont|the Duke de Gramont]], who was hostile to Bismarck. The Emperor was weak and ill, but the more extreme Bonapartists were prepared to show their strength against the republicans and monarchists in the parliament.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 47\u201350</ref>\n[[File:LeopoldHS.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]]]]\n\nIn July 1870, Bismarck found a cause for a war in an old dynastic dispute. In September 1868, Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] had been overthrown and exiled to France. The new government of Spain considered several candidates, including [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]], a cousin of [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. At the end of 1869, Napoleon III had let it be known to the Prussian king and his Chancellor Bismarck that a Hohenzollern prince on the throne of Spain would not be acceptable to France. King Wilhelm had no desire to enter into a war against Napoleon III and did not pursue the subject further. At the end of May, however, Bismarck wrote to the father of Leopold, asking him to put pressure on his son to accept the candidacy to be King of Spain. Leopold, solicited by both his father and Bismarck, agreed.\n\nThe news of Leopold's candidacy, published 2 July 1870, aroused fury in the French parliament and press. The government was attacked by both the republicans and monarchist opposition, and by the ultra-Bonapartists, for its weakness against Prussia. On 6 July, Napoleon III held a meeting of his ministers at the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Cloud and told them that Prussia must withdraw the Hohenzollern candidacy or there would be a war. He asked [[Edmond Le Boeuf|Marshal Leboeuf]], the chief of staff of the French army, if the army was prepared for a war against Prussia. Leboeuf responded that the French soldiers had a rifle superior to the Prussian rifle, that the French artillery was commanded by an elite corps of officers, and that the army \"would not lack a button on its [[puttees]]\". He assured the Emperor that the French army could have four hundred thousand men on the Rhine in less than fifteen days.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 52</ref>\n\nKing Wilhelm I did not want to be seen as the instigator of the war; he had received messages urging restraint from Emperor Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King of the Belgians]]. On 10 July, he told Leopold's father that his candidacy should be withdrawn. Leopold resisted the idea, but finally agreed on the 11th, and the withdrawal of the candidacy was announced on the 12th, a diplomatic victory for Napoleon. On the evening of the 12th, after meeting with the Empress and with his foreign minister, Gramont, he decided to push his success a little further; he would ask King Wilhelm to guarantee the Prussian government would never again make such a demand for the Spanish throne.\n\nThe French Ambassador to Prussia, Count [[Vincent Benedetti]], was sent to the German spa resort of [[Bad Ems]], where the Prussian King was staying. Benedetti met with the King on 13 July in the park of the ch\u00e2teau. The King told him courteously that he agreed fully with the withdrawal of the Hohenzollern candidacy, but that he could not make promises on behalf of the government for the future. He considered that the matter was closed. As he was instructed by Gramont, Benedetti asked for another meeting with the King to repeat the request, but the King politely, yet firmly, refused. Benedetti returned to Paris and the affair seemed finished. However, Bismarck edited the official dispatch of the meeting to make it appear that both sides had been hostile: \"His majesty the King,\" the dispatch read, \"refused to meet again with the French ambassador, and let him know, through an aide-de-camp of service, that His Majesty had nothing more to say to the Ambassador.\" This version was communicated to governments, and the next day was in the French press.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nThe [[Ems telegram]] had exactly the effect that Bismarck had intended. Once again, public opinion in France was inflamed. \"This text produced the effect of a red flag to the Gallic bull,\" Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt \"he had just received a slap.\" The leader of the conservatives in parliament, Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, [[\u00c9mile Ollivier]], declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honourably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility \"with a light heart\". A crowd of 15\u201320,000 persons, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On 19 July 1870, a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\n===Defeat in the Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Place de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|At the outbreak of the war, crowds gathered on the Place de la Bastille, chanting \"To Berlin!\"]]\n\nWhen France entered the war, there were patriotic demonstrations in the streets of Paris, with crowds singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and chanting \"To Berlin! To Berlin!\" But Napoleon was melancholic. He told General Lepic that he expected the war to be \"long and difficult\", and wondered, \"Who knows if we'll come back?\" He told [[Jacques Louis Randon|Marshal Randon]] that he felt too old for a military campaign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 473</ref> Despite his ill health, Napoleon decided to go with the army to the front as commander in chief, as he had done during the successful Italian campaign. On 28 July, he departed Saint-Cloud by train for the front. He was accompanied by the 14-year-old Prince Imperial in the uniform of the army, by his military staff, and by a large contingent of chefs and servants in livery. He was pale and visibly in pain. The Empress remained in Paris as the [[Regent]], as she had done on other occasions when the Emperor was out of the country.\n\nThe mobilization of the French army was chaotic. Two hundred thousand soldiers converged on the German frontier, along a front of 250 kilometers, choking all the roads and railways for miles. Officers were unable to find their units, and units were unable to find their officers. General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]] and the German army, with experience mobilizing in the war against Austria, were able to efficiently move three armies of 518,000 men to a more concentrated front of just 120 kilometers. In addition, the German soldiers were backed by a substantial reserve of the [[Landwehr]] (Territorial defence), with 340,000 men, and an additional reserve of 400,000 territorial guards. The French army arrived at the frontier equipped with maps of Germany, but without maps of France\u2014where the actual fighting took place\u2014and without a specific plan of what it was going to do.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, Napoleon and the Prince Imperial accompanied the army as it made a tentative crossing of the German border toward the city of [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The French won a minor skirmish and advanced no further. Napoleon III, very ill, was unable to ride his horse and had to support himself by leaning against a tree. In the meantime, the Germans had assembled a much larger army opposite Alsace and Lorraine than the French had expected or were aware of. On 4 August 1870, the Germans attacked with overwhelming force against a French division in Alsace at the [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Battle of Wissembourg]] (German: Weissenburg), forcing it to retreat. On 5 August, the Germans defeated another French Army at the [[Battle of Spicheren]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].\n\nOn 6 August, 140,000 Germans attacked 35,000 French soldiers at the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]]; the French lost 19,200 soldiers killed, wounded and captured, and were forced to retreat. The French soldiers fought bravely, and French cavalry and infantry attacked the German lines repeatedly, but the Germans had superior logistics, communications, and leadership. The decisive weapon was the new German [[C64 (field gun)|Krupp six pound field gun]], which had a steel barrel, was loaded by the breech, had a longer range, had a higher rate of fire, and was more accurate than the bronze muzzle-loading French cannons. The Krupp guns caused terrible casualties in the French ranks.<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 61</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal [[Edmond Le Boeuf]], both resigned. The Empress Eug\u00e9nie took it upon herself as the Regent to name a new government. She chose General [[Cousin-Montauban]], better known as the Count of Palikao, seventy-four years old, the former commander of the French expeditionary force to China, as her new prime minister. The Count of Palikao named Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]], the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The Empress, in charge of the government responded by telegraph, \"Don't think of coming back, unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger.\" The Emperor agreed to remain with the army.<ref>Milza, 2009, pp. 80\u201381</ref> With the Empress directing the country, and Bazaine commanding the army, the Emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the Emperor told Marshal Leboeuf, \"we've both been dismissed.\"<ref>Milza, 2009, p. 81</ref>\n\nOn 18 August 1870, the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], the biggest battle of the war, took place in Lorraine between the Germans and the army of Marshal Bazaine. The Germans suffered 20,000 casualties and the French 12,000, but the Germans emerged as the victors, as Marshal Bazaine's army, with 175,000 soldiers, six divisions of cavalry and five hundred cannons, was trapped inside the fortifications of Metz, unable to move.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\">Milza, 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nNapoleon was at [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] with the army of Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon]]. MacMahon, Marshal Bazaine, and the count of Palikao, with the Empress in Paris, all had different ideas on what the army should do next, and the Emperor had to act as a referee among them. The Emperor and MacMahon proposed moving their army closer to Paris to protect the city, but on 17 August Bazaine telegraphed to the Emperor: \"I urge you to renounce this idea, which seems to abandon the Army at Metz... Couldn't you make a powerful diversion toward the Prussian corps, which are already exhausted by so many battles? The Empress shares my opinion.\" Napoleon III wrote back, \"I yield to your opinion.\"<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 480</ref> The Emperor sent the Prince Imperial back to Paris for his safety, and went with the weary army in the direction of Metz. The Emperor, riding in an open carriage, was jeered, sworn at and insulted by demoralized soldiers.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre p. 92\"/>\n\nThe direction of movement of MacMahon's army was supposed to be secret, but it was published in the French press and thus was quickly known to the German general staff. Moltke, the German commander, ordered two Prussian armies marching toward Paris to turn towards MacMahon's army. On 30 August, one corps of MacMahon's army was attacked by the Germans at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]], losing five hundred men and forty cannons. MacMahon, believing he was ahead of the Germans, decided to stop and reorganize his forces at the fortified city of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], in the [[Ardennes]] close to the Belgian border.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 482</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sedan and capitulation====\n{{Further|Battle of Sedan (1870)}}\n[[File:The fallen emperor and triumphant statesman talked together.jpg|thumb|Bismarck with Napoleon III after his capitulation]]\n\nThe Battle of Sedan was a total disaster for the French\u2014the army surrendered to the Prussians and Napoleon himself was made a prisoner of war.<ref>Alan Strauss-Schom, ''The Shadow Emperor: A Biography of Napoleon III'' (2018) pp. 404\u201318.</ref> MacMahon arrived at Sedan with one hundred thousand soldiers, not knowing that two German armies were closing in on the city (one from the west and one from the east), blocking any escape. The Germans arrived on 31 August, and by 1 September, occupied the heights around Sedan, placed batteries of artillery, and began to shell the French positions below. At five o'clock in the morning on 1 September, a German shell seriously wounded MacMahon in the hip. Sedan soon came under bombardment from seven hundred German guns.<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\">Milza, 2006, p. 708</ref> MacMahon's replacement, General [[Emmanuel F\u00e9lix de Wimpffen|Wimpffen]], launched a series of valiant cavalry attacks to try to break the German encirclement, with no success. During the battle and bombardment, the French lost seventeen thousand killed or wounded and twenty-one thousand captured.\n\nAs the German shells rained down on the French positions, Napoleon III wandered aimlessly in the open around the French positions. One officer of his military escort was killed and two more received wounds. A doctor accompanying him wrote in his notebook, \"If this man has not come here to kill himself, I don't know what he has come to do. I have not seen him give an order all morning.\"<ref name=\"Milza, 2006, p. 708\"/>\n\nFinally, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Napoleon emerged from his [[daydream|reverie]] and ordered a white flag hoisted above the citadel. He then had a message sent to the Prussian King, who was at Sedan with his army: \"Monsieur my brother, not being able to die at the head of my troops, nothing remains for me but to place my sword in the hands of Your Majesty.\"<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 709</ref>\n\nAfter the war, when accused of having made a \"shameful surrender\" at Sedan, he wrote: \n\n{{bquote|Some people believe that, by burying ourselves under the ruins of Sedan, we would have better served my name and my dynasty. It's possible. Nay, to hold in my hand the lives of thousands of men and not to make a sign to save them was something that was beyond my capacity....my heart refused these sinister grandeurs.<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 79</ref>}}\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning on 2 September, in the uniform of a general and accompanied by four generals from his staff, Napoleon was taken to the German headquarters at [[Donchery]]. He expected to see King William, but instead he was met by Bismarck and the German commander, General von Moltke. They dictated the terms of the surrender to Napoleon. Napoleon asked that his army be disarmed and allowed to pass into Belgium, but Bismarck refused. They also asked Napoleon to sign the preliminary documents of a peace treaty, but Napoleon refused, telling them that the French government headed by the Regent, Empress Eug\u00e9nie, would need to negotiate any peace agreement. The Emperor was then taken to the Chateau at Bellevue near {{interlanguage link|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)|fr|Fr\u00e9nois (Ardennes)}}, where the Prussian King visited him. Napoleon told the King that he had not wanted the war, but that public opinion had forced him into it. The Prussian king politely agreed.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} That evening, from the Chateau, Napoleon wrote to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie: \n\n{{bquote|It is impossible for me to say what I have suffered and what I am suffering now...I would have preferred death to a capitulation so disastrous, and yet, under the present circumstances, it was the only way to avoid the butchering of sixty thousand people. If only all my torments were concentrated here! I think of you, our son, and our unhappy country.<ref>\nMilza, 2006, p. 710\n</ref>}}\n\n====Aftermath====\nThe news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September, confirming the rumors that were already circulating in the city. When the news was given to the Empress that the Emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, \"No! An Emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!\".<ref>Milza, 2006, p. 711</ref> Later, when hostile crowds formed near the palace, and the staff began to flee, the Empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, who took her to [[Deauville]]. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England.

But by this time, Metz had already fallen, leaving Napoleon without a power basis. Bismarck did not see much chance for a restored empire as Napoleon would look like a marionette of the enemy to the French people.<ref>David Wetzel: ''A Duel of Nations.

Bonapartist candidates participated in the first elections for the National Assembly on 8 February, but won only five seats. On 1 March, the newly elected assembly officially declared the removal of the Emperor from power and placed all the blame for the French defeat squarely on him.<ref name=\"Louis Girard p. 488\"/> When peace was arranged between France and Germany, Bismarck released Napoleon. He decided to go into exile in England. Napoleon had limited funds; he sold properties and jewels and arrived in England on 20 March 1871.\n\n[[File:Napoleon III after Death - Illustrated London News Jan 25 1873-2.PNG|thumb|Napoleon III after his death, wood-engraving in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' of 25 January 1873, after a photograph by Mssrs.

She had assisted his escape from French prison in 1846.\n\nHe had also paid attention to another English girl, Elizabeth Howard, who later gave birth to a son, whose father (not Louis-Napoleon) settled property on her to support the son, via a trust whose trustee was Nathaniel Strode. Strode bought Camden Place in 1860 and spent large sums of money transforming it into a French chateau. Strode had also received money from the Emperor, possibly to buy Camden Place and maintain it as a [[Retreat (survivalism)|bolt hole]].<ref>[http://www.chislehurst-society.org.uk/Pages/About/People/NapoleonIII.html Napoleon III of France<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNapoleon passed his time writing and designing a stove which would be more energy efficient. In the summer of 1872, his health began to worsen. Doctors recommended surgery to remove his gallstones. After two operations, he became very seriously ill.

Two of France's largest banks, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], still in existence today, were founded during that period. The French stock market also expanded prodigiously, with many coal mining and steel companies issuing stocks. Historians credit Napoleon chiefly for supporting the railways, but not otherwise building the economy.<ref>Charles P. Kindleberger, ''Economic Growth in France and Britain 1851\u20131950'' (1964) pp. 6, 42, 186\u201388</ref>\n\nNapoleon's military pressure and Russian mistakes, culminating in the Crimean War, dealt a fatal blow to the [[Concert of Europe]]. It was based on stability and balance of powers, whereas Napoleon attempted to rearrange the world map to France's favour even when it involved radical and potentially revolutionary changes in politics. A [[Canon obusier de 12|12-pound cannon]] designed by France is commonly referred to as a \"Napoleon cannon\" or \"12-pounder Napoleon\" in his honour.\n\n===Historical reputation===\nThe historical reputation of Napoleon III is far below that of his uncle. [[Victor Hugo]] portrayed him as \"Napoleon the Small\" (''[[Napol\u00e9on le Petit]]''), a mere mediocrity, in contrast with Napoleon I \"The Great\", presented as a military and administrative genius. In France, such arch-opposition from the age's central literary figure, whose attacks on Napoleon III were obsessive and powerful, made it impossible for a very long time to assess his reign objectively. [[Karl Marx]], in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', famously mocked Napoleon III by saying \"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historical facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\" Napoleon III has often been seen as an authoritarian but ineffectual leader who brought France into dubious, and ultimately disastrous, foreign military adventures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

His greatest achievements came in material improvements, in the form of  a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris. He is given high credits for the rebuilding of Paris with broad boulevards, striking public buildings, and very attractive residential districts for upscale Parisians. He promoted French business and exports. In international policy, he tried to emulate his uncle, with numerous imperial ventures around the world, as well as wars in Europe. He badly mishandled the threat from Prussia and found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming force.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''[France: 1815 to the Present'' (1963) online p. 275]</ref>\n\nHistorians have also praised his attention to the fate of the working classes and poor people. His book ''Extinction du paup\u00e9risme'' (\"Extinction of pauperism\"), which he wrote while imprisoned at the Fort of Ham in 1844, contributed to his popularity among the working classes and thus his election in 1848. Throughout his reign, the emperor worked to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, on occasion breaching the 19th-century economic orthodoxy of freedom and [[laissez-faire]] and using state resources or interfering in the market. Among other things, the Emperor granted the right to strike to French workers in 1864, despite intense opposition from corporate lobbies.\n\n===Screen===\n\nOn screen Napoleon has been portrayed by:\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] in \n**''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' (1936)\n**''[[A Dispatch from Reuter's]]'' (1940)\n* [[Frank Vosper]] in ''[[Spy of Napoleon]]'' (1936)\n* [[Guy Bates Post]] in \n**''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937) \n**''[[The Mad Empress]]'' (1939)\n* [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]] in ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'' (1938)\n* [[Claude Rains]] in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'' (1939) \n* [[Walter Franck]] in ''[[Bismarck (1940 film)|Bismarck]]'' (1940)\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] in ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n* David Bond in ''[[The Sword of Monte Cristo]]'' (1951)\n* [[Siegfried Wischnewski]] in ''[[Maximilian von Mexiko]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximilian von Mexiko|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379886/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Robert Dumont in ''[[Those Years]]'' (Spanish: ''Aquellos a\u00f1os'', 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquellos a\u00f1os|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193724/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n* Julian Sherrier in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'' (1975)\n* [[Nick Jameson]] in ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'' (1998)\n* [[Erwin Steinhauer]] in ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sisi|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442136/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon III also plays a small but crucial role in ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' (2015).\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 9 July 1810: His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France, Prince of Holland\n* 20 April 1808 \u2013 20 December 1848: His Imperial Highness Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on of France\n* 20 December 1848 \u2013 2 December 1852: His Imperial Highness The Prince-President of the French Republic (\"''{{lang|fr|Son Altesse Imp\u00e9riale le Prince-President}}''\")\n* 2 December 1852 \u2013 1 March 1871: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French\n* 1 March 1871 \u2013 9 January 1873: His Imperial Majesty Napol\u00e9on III{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHis full title as emperor was: \"Napoleon the Third, [[By the Grace of God]] and the will of the [[Second French Empire|Nation]], [[Emperor of the French]]\".<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/napoleon.htm#naptitles \"Napol\u00e9on's Titles\"].
