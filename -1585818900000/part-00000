His writing revolves around the [[Telugu language]], peppered with puns and social and political issues. It is clean and devoid of any references to child-unsafe topics. Therefore, Amrutham has audience ranging from kids to senior citizens and has always been No.1 when it was telecast. Even to date, it has the highest number of views compared to any Telugu serial ever produced.

His writing revolves around the [[Telugu language]], peppered with puns and social and political issues. It is clean and devoid of any references to child-unsafe topics. Therefore, Amrutham has audience ranging from kids to senior citizens and has always been No.1 when it was telecast. Even to date, it has the highest number of views compared to any Telugu serial ever produced. Though it has been almost two decades that the first episode of the sitcom was telecast, the huge fan base kept on increasing through the years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/telugu/a-trip-down-memory-lane-on-the-anniversary-of-the-hit-tv-series-amrutham/articleshow/61700737.cms|title=A trip down memory lane on the anniversary of the hit TV series 'Amrutham' - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref>\n== Release ==\nThe series was released on March 25,2020 on the occasion of [[Ugadi]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telugu.samayam.com/tv/news/telugu-comedy-serial-amrutham-season-2-will-be-start-from-march-25/articleshow/74288239.cms|title=Amrutham Serial: \u0c2e\u0c33\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c40 \u0c35\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c41\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28 \u2018\u0c05\u0c2e\u0c43\u0c24\u0c02\u2019 \u0c38\u0c40\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c4d.. \u0c05\u0c02\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c42\u0c2a\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c4a\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c24 \u0c05\u0c02\u0c1c\u0c3f\u0c35\u0c48\u0c2a\u0c47 - telugu comedy serial amrutham season 2 will be start from march 25|website=Samayam Telugu}}</ref>.\n=== Promotion ===\nThe trailer of the series is released by [[S.

Scars result from the biological process of [[wound repair]] in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.\n\nScar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.<ref name=\"collagenskinscar2010-08-20\">{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition.

Do you know that just like acne, even acne scars have different types? If you want to know more about acne scars in detail, then this is information for you. Often, even after the pimples and acne get better, they leave behind dark spots, patches or scars. Inflammatory acne-like red pimples, papules, pustules, nodules, cyst, are injuries to the skin that set of the inflammatory process. The skin starts its healing process to heal this injury and starts collagen production. The collagen production fluctuates and may increase or decrease. This may cause pits or depressions in the skin, these are called acne scars. And the opposite of these, are the bumpy scars that project outwards from the skin. [https://www.swasthsharir.com/2019/10/facial-scars.html Scars] are the result of inflammatory acne or papulopustular acne. Papulopustular acne is red blemishes, pimples, papules, and pustules, that we call zits, and larger swollen lesions, that we call nodules. Not getting this type of acne treated on time and poking or prodding them to cause further injury to the skin.\n\n<u>[https://www.swasthsharir.com/2019/10/facial-scars.html importance of collagen]</u>\n\nThe body starts the natural healing process or the damage repair process to treat the inflammation, infection or injury. Collagen plays an important and compulsory role in the skin repair process. If the amount of collagen produced in the healing process is less, small or big pits or depressions are formed on the face. This causes the skin to appear uneven. Your skin may also appear red, dark and pigmented. These scars are called depressed or atrophic scars. These are most commonly visible on your cheeks or forehead. If excess collagen is produced in the healing process, small bumpy lesions start forming on the face. These are called raised, keloid or hypertrophic scars. These are most visible on the chest, back, nose and chin. The intensity or severity of atrophic or raised scars varies from person to person. There are different ways in which acne scars are classified, we will discuss the important ones today. They can be classified from grade 1 to grade 4 or from mild to moderate to severe.\n\nWe will discuss this as it is practical and based on treatment and management. Grade 1 has macular scars that are flat and superficial to others. They may look like red flat marks or pigmented black marks which look ugly. Grade 2 has mild scarring, which looks like a mild depression on the skin that may not even be visible from a distance. These can be easily covered up with makeup. Grade 3 has moderate scarring that may be visible at a social distance and in photos as well. Grade 4 has very severe scarring that is quite deep or \n\ndepressed. Big pits are formed on the skin that may require several treatment sessions and a combination of different treatments as well. Before finding out more about the [https://www.swasthsharir.com/2019/10/facial-scars.html acne scar] types, let us talk a bit about how doctors assess or examine these scars. Acne scars are quite complex and they have different grades and types. Trained skin specialists usually examine these scars in angle lighting to determine the type. It is difficult to assess acne scars indirect or normal light, flashlight or photos. \n\nWe will discuss this as it is practical and based on treatment and management.

Trained skin specialists usually examine these scars in angle lighting to determine the type. It is difficult to assess acne scars indirect or normal light, flashlight or photos.\n\nThat is why the angle or tangential lighting is used to examine scars. This also makes it easy to differentiate between acne scars and pigmentation face. After this, high-resolution photos are taken to map the scars and identify the subtype. The second important factor to examine acne scars is animation. When you laugh or talk or there is movement in general that is when scars should be examined. This will give an idea of how much the scars are tethered to your skin. Tethering is a measure of how much the skin gets pulled when you laugh.\n\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Novak 7 (5451438566).jpg|thumb|right|Man with visible facial scars.]]\nAll scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> Scar tissue also lacks elasticity<ref name=elasticFibersScars>{{cite book | last = A.

To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen<ref name=\"Fibroblast\"/> scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue.

Scars result from the biological process of [[wound repair]] in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.\n\nScar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.<ref name=\"collagenskinscar2010-08-20\">{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition.

To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen<ref name=\"Fibroblast\"/> scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue.

It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe [[glabella]] lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peel]]s can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Vitamins===\nResearch shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.<ref name=Shih2007/> Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Farris PK.

They play in [[Premiership Rugby]], England's top division of rugby.\n\nThe club was founded as '''Bristol Football Club''' in 1888; between 1921 and 2014 Bristol's home matches were played at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]] and since 2014 Bristol plays its home matches at [[Ashton Gate Stadium]] in the south-west of the city.  The current head coach is [[Pat Lam]] who was appointed in 2017.\n\nThe club announced a new nickname of '''Bears''' to be used from 1 June 2018; between 2001 and 2005 the club were known as '''Bristol Shoguns''' due to a sponsorship deal with [[Mitsubishi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/04/16/bristol-rugby-rebrand-bristol-bears-ahead-aviva-premiership/|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 April 2018|accessdate=1 June 2018|title=Bristol Rugby to rebrand as Bristol Bears ahead of Gallagher Premiership Rugby return }}</ref>\n\nBristol won the [[1982\u201383 John Player Cup|1983 John Player Cup]] and have also won England's second division four times, most recently in [[2017\u201318 RFU Championship|2017\u201318]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early history===\nBristol Football Club was formed in 1888 when the Carlton club merged with rival club [[Redland, Bristol|Redland]] Park to create a united Bristol team.<ref name=\"rugger\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KsV8CgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA151&dq=bristol%20rugby%20history%20-wikipedia%20carlton&pg=PA151#v=onepage&q&f=false Rugger - The History, Theory and Practice of Rugby Football] Wakefield, W. 1928</ref> Westbury Park having refused to merge then folded and many of its players subsequently joined Bristol. The [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|County Cricket Ground]] at Nevil Road was leased for home matches.\n\nThe first match was a heavy away defeat to Cardiff and although the first season was relatively successful the second was not with only three games won. The club went from strength to strength over the next few years under the captaincy of W. Tommy Thomson. It turned the corner and in 1891\u201392, now wearing the more familiar navy and white hooped shirts, the Bristol team won 20 games out of 24.\n\nOver the ensuing seasons the fixture list went from strength to strength, consisting of most of the top English and Welsh sides. In 1900 J. W. Jarman became Bristol's first [[England national rugby union team|England]] cap. Two major touring sides played Bristol during this period. The first New Zealand [[All Blacks]] defeated the club 41\u20130 in 1905 and in 1909 a combined Bristol and [[Clifton Rugby Football Club|Clifton RFC]] team, captained by [[Percy Down]], lost to Australia 11\u20133.\n\n===World Wars===\nThe club was beginning to bring on a new generation of players when the First World War halted all rugby. After the war a Bristol United side was formed to provide rugby for returning servicemen and this led to the rebirth of Bristol in 1919. The County Ground was no longer available for home games so the club rented a field at Radnor Road,<ref name=\"ESPN\">[http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/story/228425.html The End of the Line] ESPN, Huw Richards, 04/06/14</ref> Horfield although occasional matches were staged at the [[Bristol City]] and [[Bristol Rovers]] grounds.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> The Radnor Road seasons were good ones for the club and a new crop of stars appeared.\n\nThe [[Memorial Ground]] stadium was built on an area of land called Buffalo Bill's Field which was previously occupied by [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]] in 1921.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/>  Bristol defeated Cardiff 19\u20133 in the opening match in front of a large crowd.<ref name=\"rugger\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary was celebrated in 1938 but the next few years saw a fall in performances and the final inter-war season was a poor one. During World War II a Bristol Supporters team kept [[rugby union]] going in the city. Thus Bristol had readily available players when peacetime rugby union resumed in 1945.\n\n===1950s===\nThe playing record in the early fifties was mixed, but there was a huge improvement under the captaincy of first Bert MacDonald, and then Dick Hawkes. Records were broken in 1956\u201357 and even better was to follow in what has been called 'The Blake Era'.\n\nFly half John Blake became captain in 1957 and under his leadership the club developed an entertaining running style of rugby involving backs and forwards, which was years ahead of its time. The Bristol club set and broke new records for wins in a season and points scored and goal kicking forward Gordon Cripps rewrote the individual points scoring records.\n\n===1960s\u20131980s===\nThe 75th anniversary was celebrated in 1962\u201363 and floodlights were installed in the following season. Club form peaked in 1965\u201366 under Derek Neate's captaincy when 39 games were won, and again in 1971\u201372 under Tony Nicholls. This was the club's best ever season with a thousand points being scored for the first time<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> and the team being crowned unofficial English and Anglo-Welsh champions.\n\nUnder Mike Rafter's captaincy, the club won the John Player Cup in 1983, defeating Leicester 28\u201322. During this period Alan Morley established a world record of 479 tries in senior rugby. The centenary season with Nigel Pomphrey as captain was celebrated in style with a game against the Barbarians and a narrow defeat in the cup final.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1996, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] moved into the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] as tenants of Bristol Rugby, and later took over ownership of the stadium through the Memorial Stadium Company.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\n1998\u201399 ([[1998\u201399 Allied Dunbar Premiership Two|Premership Two]])<br />\nRelegation to [[RFU Championship|Premiership Two]] in 1998 was not the worst of Bristol's problems. Only an eleventh hour rescue by Malcolm Pearce saved the club from potential oblivion. Bristol also lost control of the Memorial Stadium Company to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and were tenants thereafter until their eventual departure from the stadium at the conclusion of the 2013\u201314 season. Bristol's first season outside the top flight brought with it a number of first-time visits to clubs. Bristol went on to win the [[RFU Championship|Premiership Two]] title and promotion back to [[Guinness Premiership|Premiership One]], sealing the win with a 22\u201311 victory over [[Worcester Warriors|Worcester]].\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:BristolRugby.jpg|thumb|Bristol playing Northampton during the 2007\u201308 Premiership.]]\nThe [[1999 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] disrupted the early part of the 1999\u201300 season, with a number of players missing the first few games. Under the captaincy of [[Dean Ryan]] the team finished sixth, just missing out on [[Heineken Cup|European Cup]] qualification. At the end of the season [[Dean Ryan]] took over as Head Coach from [[Bob Dwyer]]. After an opening day victory over newly promoted [[Rotherham R.U.F.C.|Rotherham]], Bristol had a disappointing 2000\u201301 season finishing ninth. Off the field, [[Jack Rowell]] became managing director, and successful community initiatives saw the attendance figures rise. Chief Executive [[Nicholas de Scossa]] was involved in debates about top clubs separating from the Rugby Football Union and forming a new Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ackford |first1=Paul |title=De Scossa blunder proves costly |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/4773705/De-Scossa-blunder-proves-costly.html |accessdate=15 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=15 October 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe 2001\u201302 season brought a new name, '''Bristol Shoguns''', following a five-year \u00a32-million sponsorship deal with [[Mitsubishi]] Motors. The Shoguns finishing the season with the most bonus points in the [[Guinness Premiership|Zurich Premiership]], three players in the top try scorers chart, a place at [[Twickenham stadium|Twickenham]] in the final of the play-offs (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title), and also a place in the [[Heineken Cup]] for the 2002\u201303 season. In the close season Head Coach [[Dean Ryan]] moved to [[Gloucester RFC|Gloucester]], [[Jack Rowell]] resigned as Director of Rugby whilst skipper [[Jason Little (rugby union)|Jason Little]] retired. [[Peter Thorburn]] took over as coach. League results were mixed, but there were more wins than defeats including a first ever league win away at [[Bath Rugby|Bath]]. At Christmas 2002 owner Malcolm Pearce announced that he would quit at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/3027509.stm|title=Bristol boss quits club|date=14 May 2003|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Rumours circulated that Bristol could be sold to [[Firoz Kassam]] and play out of [[Oxford]], and a merger with rivals [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] had been mooted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/may/02/rugbyunion.bath|title=Bristol and Bath hold merger talks|date=2 May 2003|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> Neither event came to pass, but Bristol were relegated at the end of the season as off-field distractions took their toll.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2404179/Former-players-could-save-Shoguns.html|title=Former players could save Shoguns|date=16 May 2003|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the 2003\u201304 season [[Martin Haag]] and a week later [[Richard Hill (scrum-half)|Richard Hill]] joined as first team coach and head coach respectively. While the board were raising money to stabilise the club Haag and Hill implemented a 'three-year plan' to rebuild Bristol and put them back in the [[Guinness Premiership|Premiership]]. They won [[RFU Championship|National League One]] the following year and were promoted.\n\nThe club's deal with [[Mitsubishi]] expired in July 2005, and the club started 2005\u201306 in the Premiership as Bristol RFC. Bristol elected to play two [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|2006\u201307]] games at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]], home of [[association football|football]] side [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. The local derby against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] and the game against [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] were moved from the 11,750 capacity [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] to Ashton Gate's 21,500 capacity to allow more fans the chance to watch the team. The precedent for this was established for a crucial relegation fixture against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] in May 2003. Bristol finished third in [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|the league]], securing a [[Heineken Cup]] place for only the second time, and then reached the semi-finals of the [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|play-offs]], losing 26\u201314 at [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]].

In the run-in to the end of season play-off's the club signed high-profile players in Hooker [[Ross McMillan]], Italian Centre [[Tommaso Benvenuti (rugby union)|Tommaso Benvenuti]] and Welsh international [[Gavin Henson]].

[[rugby union]] club based in [[Bristol]], England.  They play in [[Premiership Rugby]], England's top division of rugby.\n\nThe club was founded as '''Bristol Football Club''' in 1888; between 1921 and 2014 Bristol's home matches were played at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]] and since 2014 Bristol plays its home matches at [[Ashton Gate Stadium]] in the south-west of the city.  The current head coach is [[Pat Lam]] who was appointed in 2017.\n\nThe club announced a new nickname of '''Bears''' to be used from 1 June 2018; between 2001 and 2005 the club were known as '''Bristol Shoguns''' due to a sponsorship deal with [[Mitsubishi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/04/16/bristol-rugby-rebrand-bristol-bears-ahead-aviva-premiership/|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 April 2018|accessdate=1 June 2018|title=Bristol Rugby to rebrand as Bristol Bears ahead of Gallagher Premiership Rugby return }}</ref>\n\nBristol won the [[1982\u201383 John Player Cup|1983 John Player Cup]] and have also won England's second division four times, most recently in [[2017\u201318 RFU Championship|2017\u201318]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early history===\nBristol Football Club was formed in 1888 when the Carlton club merged with rival club [[Redland, Bristol|Redland]] Park to create a united Bristol team.<ref name=\"rugger\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KsV8CgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA151&dq=bristol%20rugby%20history%20-wikipedia%20carlton&pg=PA151#v=onepage&q&f=false Rugger - The History, Theory and Practice of Rugby Football] Wakefield, W. 1928</ref> Westbury Park having refused to merge then folded and many of its players subsequently joined Bristol. The [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|County Cricket Ground]] at Nevil Road was leased for home matches.\n\nThe first match was a heavy away defeat to Cardiff and although the first season was relatively successful the second was not with only three games won. The club went from strength to strength over the next few years under the captaincy of W. Tommy Thomson. It turned the corner and in 1891\u201392, now wearing the more familiar navy and white hooped shirts, the Bristol team won 20 games out of 24.\n\nOver the ensuing seasons the fixture list went from strength to strength, consisting of most of the top English and Welsh sides. In 1900 J. W. Jarman became Bristol's first [[England national rugby union team|England]] cap. Two major touring sides played Bristol during this period. The first New Zealand [[All Blacks]] defeated the club 41\u20130 in 1905 and in 1909 a combined Bristol and [[Clifton Rugby Football Club|Clifton RFC]] team, captained by [[Percy Down]], lost to Australia 11\u20133.\n\n===World Wars===\nThe club was beginning to bring on a new generation of players when the First World War halted all rugby. After the war a Bristol United side was formed to provide rugby for returning servicemen and this led to the rebirth of Bristol in 1919. The County Ground was no longer available for home games so the club rented a field at Radnor Road,<ref name=\"ESPN\">[http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/story/228425.html The End of the Line] ESPN, Huw Richards, 04/06/14</ref> Horfield although occasional matches were staged at the [[Bristol City]] and [[Bristol Rovers]] grounds.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> The Radnor Road seasons were good ones for the club and a new crop of stars appeared.\n\nThe [[Memorial Ground]] stadium was built on an area of land called Buffalo Bill's Field which was previously occupied by [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]] in 1921.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/>  Bristol defeated Cardiff 19\u20133 in the opening match in front of a large crowd.<ref name=\"rugger\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary was celebrated in 1938 but the next few years saw a fall in performances and the final inter-war season was a poor one. During World War II a Bristol Supporters team kept [[rugby union]] going in the city. Thus Bristol had readily available players when peacetime rugby union resumed in 1945.\n\n===1950s===\nThe playing record in the early fifties was mixed, but there was a huge improvement under the captaincy of first Bert MacDonald, and then Dick Hawkes. Records were broken in 1956\u201357 and even better was to follow in what has been called 'The Blake Era'.\n\nFly half John Blake became captain in 1957 and under his leadership the club developed an entertaining running style of rugby involving backs and forwards, which was years ahead of its time. The Bristol club set and broke new records for wins in a season and points scored and goal kicking forward Gordon Cripps rewrote the individual points scoring records.\n\n===1960s\u20131980s===\nThe 75th anniversary was celebrated in 1962\u201363 and floodlights were installed in the following season. Club form peaked in 1965\u201366 under Derek Neate's captaincy when 39 games were won, and again in 1971\u201372 under Tony Nicholls. This was the club's best ever season with a thousand points being scored for the first time<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> and the team being crowned unofficial English and Anglo-Welsh champions.\n\nUnder Mike Rafter's captaincy, the club won the John Player Cup in 1983, defeating Leicester 28\u201322. During this period Alan Morley established a world record of 479 tries in senior rugby. The centenary season with Nigel Pomphrey as captain was celebrated in style with a game against the Barbarians and a narrow defeat in the cup final.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1996, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] moved into the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] as tenants of Bristol Rugby, and later took over ownership of the stadium through the Memorial Stadium Company.<ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\n1998\u201399 ([[1998\u201399 Allied Dunbar Premiership Two|Premership Two]])<br />\nRelegation to [[RFU Championship|Premiership Two]] in 1998 was not the worst of Bristol's problems. Only an eleventh hour rescue by Malcolm Pearce saved the club from potential oblivion. Bristol also lost control of the Memorial Stadium Company to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and were tenants thereafter until their eventual departure from the stadium at the conclusion of the 2013\u201314 season. Bristol's first season outside the top flight brought with it a number of first-time visits to clubs. Bristol went on to win the [[RFU Championship|Premiership Two]] title and promotion back to [[Guinness Premiership|Premiership One]], sealing the win with a 22\u201311 victory over [[Worcester Warriors|Worcester]].\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:BristolRugby.jpg|thumb|Bristol playing Northampton during the 2007\u201308 Premiership.]]\nThe [[1999 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] disrupted the early part of the 1999\u201300 season, with a number of players missing the first few games. Under the captaincy of [[Dean Ryan]] the team finished sixth, just missing out on [[Heineken Cup|European Cup]] qualification. At the end of the season [[Dean Ryan]] took over as Head Coach from [[Bob Dwyer]]. After an opening day victory over newly promoted [[Rotherham R.U.F.C.|Rotherham]], Bristol had a disappointing 2000\u201301 season finishing ninth. Off the field, [[Jack Rowell]] became managing director, and successful community initiatives saw the attendance figures rise. Chief Executive [[Nicholas de Scossa]] was involved in debates about top clubs separating from the Rugby Football Union and forming a new Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ackford |first1=Paul |title=De Scossa blunder proves costly |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/4773705/De-Scossa-blunder-proves-costly.html |accessdate=15 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=15 October 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe 2001\u201302 season brought a new name, '''Bristol Shoguns''', following a five-year \u00a32-million sponsorship deal with [[Mitsubishi]] Motors. The Shoguns finishing the season with the most bonus points in the [[Guinness Premiership|Zurich Premiership]], three players in the top try scorers chart, a place at [[Twickenham stadium|Twickenham]] in the final of the play-offs (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title), and also a place in the [[Heineken Cup]] for the 2002\u201303 season. In the close season Head Coach [[Dean Ryan]] moved to [[Gloucester RFC|Gloucester]], [[Jack Rowell]] resigned as Director of Rugby whilst skipper [[Jason Little (rugby union)|Jason Little]] retired. [[Peter Thorburn]] took over as coach. League results were mixed, but there were more wins than defeats including a first ever league win away at [[Bath Rugby|Bath]]. At Christmas 2002 owner Malcolm Pearce announced that he would quit at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/3027509.stm|title=Bristol boss quits club|date=14 May 2003|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Rumours circulated that Bristol could be sold to [[Firoz Kassam]] and play out of [[Oxford]], and a merger with rivals [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] had been mooted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/may/02/rugbyunion.bath|title=Bristol and Bath hold merger talks|date=2 May 2003|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> Neither event came to pass, but Bristol were relegated at the end of the season as off-field distractions took their toll.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2404179/Former-players-could-save-Shoguns.html|title=Former players could save Shoguns|date=16 May 2003|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the 2003\u201304 season [[Martin Haag]] and a week later [[Richard Hill (scrum-half)|Richard Hill]] joined as first team coach and head coach respectively. While the board were raising money to stabilise the club Haag and Hill implemented a 'three-year plan' to rebuild Bristol and put them back in the [[Guinness Premiership|Premiership]]. They won [[RFU Championship|National League One]] the following year and were promoted.\n\nThe club's deal with [[Mitsubishi]] expired in July 2005, and the club started 2005\u201306 in the Premiership as Bristol RFC. Bristol elected to play two [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|2006\u201307]] games at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]], home of [[association football|football]] side [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. The local derby against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] and the game against [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] were moved from the 11,750 capacity [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] to Ashton Gate's 21,500 capacity to allow more fans the chance to watch the team. The precedent for this was established for a crucial relegation fixture against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] in May 2003. Bristol finished third in [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|the league]], securing a [[Heineken Cup]] place for only the second time, and then reached the semi-finals of the [[2006\u201307 Guinness Premiership|play-offs]], losing 26\u201314 at [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]].

In the run-in to the end of season play-off's the club signed high-profile players in Hooker [[Ross McMillan]], Italian Centre [[Tommaso Benvenuti (rugby union)|Tommaso Benvenuti]] and Welsh international [[Gavin Henson]].
