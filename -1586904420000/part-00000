They discover that the mansion conceals the Umbrella Corporation's base where they developed the T-virus with their end-goal being the creation of a bio-weapon known as the Tyrant (for whom the virus named). Playing as either of the characters, the player must navigate the mansion alternately with the help of [[Barry Burton]] or [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]] until they are betrayed by [[Albert Wesker]] who was secretly planning to steal the T-virus. Though appearing to be killed by the Tyrant, Wesker survived and masterminded some later events behind the scenes.\n\n''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', a prequel released originally for the [[GameCube]], details the events leading up to the first game and follows Rebecca Chambers as she is separated from the Bravo team and has to team up with fugitive [[Billy Coen]].\n\n''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' follows a few months after the events of the first game when rats start infecting the population of Raccoon City with the G-virus. Playing alternately as [[Claire Redfield]], the sister of Chris from the first game, or [[Leon S. Kennedy]], a rookie police officer starting on the day of the outbreak. The players must escape from the city while at the same time confronting the mad scientist [[William Birkin]]. The same plot is repeated with minor differences in [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|the 2019 remake]].\n\n''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', set both before and after the events of the second game, follows Jill Valentine's escape from Raccoon City while being pursued by another Umbrella bio-weapon, the Nemesis-T Type. The plot concludes with the sterilization of Raccoon City by a nuclear strike.\n\n=== Post-Raccoon City ===\n''[[Resident Evil \u2013 Code: Veronica]]'' follows Claire's journey after escaping Raccoon City. She is captured trying to break into Umbrella's Paris facility and is transported to one of their research facilities. The facility is attacked by Albert Wesker's forces and becomes also overrun with the T-virus. Claire escapes and starts looking for her brother Chris while having to deal with Alfred and [[Alexia Ashford]]. Unbeknownst to her, Chris finds his way to the island and tracks Claire to the Arctic Umbrella facility. At the game's finale, Chris defeats the genetically-modified Alexia, faces off against Wesker and escapes with Claire.\n\n''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' follows [[Leon S. Kennedy]]'s mission to rescue the daughter of the president of the United States, who has been captured by Los Illuminados, a cult in Spain led by Osmund Saddler. Instead of T-virus infected zombies, Leon faces off against villagers infected with the Las Plagas parasite, which are labeled as Ganados, meaning livestock in Spanish, which makes them unyieldingly murderous but also maintains their dexterity and mobility, unlike the slow, shambling undead.\n\n''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' concerns Chris Redfield's attempts to stop the selling of illegal bio-weapons in Africa, helped by [[Sheva Alomar]]. The bio-weapons in question were developed using the Las Plagas. The plot eventually involves Albert Wesker's plans to destroy humanity with a viral agent based on the Progenitor Virus and T-virus Antibodies called Uroboros.\n\n''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]'' is set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, shortly after the establishment of the counter-terrorism group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). The game follows counter-terrorism agents [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Chris Redfield]] as they try to stop a bioterrorist organization from infecting the Earth's oceans with a virus. \n\n''[[Resident Evil 6]]'' follows multiple protagonists, including [[Leon S. Kennedy]], [[Chris Redfield]], [[Ada Wong]] and [[Jake Muller]], who become involved in a terrorist strike using bio-weapons which results in the zombification of the President of the United States. The story involves a new fast-acting zombie virus called the C-virus which has been weaponized by the NSA to induce fear in the general populace and focuses on the individual characters' attempts to stop it from spreading.\n\nIn ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]'' the plot is set between the events of Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6. The story begins when Claire Redfield and her co-workers, including the newcomer and playable protagonist, Moira Burton, are at a party in the headquarters of the NGO Terra Save, when they are attacked by unknown assailants and taken away to a deserted island, where Barry Burton and Natalia Korda also are involved for different reasons as the other two playable characters of the game.\n\nIn ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', the player controls [[Ethan Winters]], who wants to locate his missing wife, Mia, and has to defend himself against a strange family inside their seemingly abandoned house.\n\n=== Related games and other media ===\nSeveral other games follow the escapades of singular characters. 2003's ''[[Resident Evil: Outbreak]]'' and its 2005 sequel ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2|Resident Evil: Outbreak File #2]]'' instead introduced eight new characters whom the player guides through the Raccoon City incident as they slowly succumb to the T-Virus (or find a cure). These two installments were playable both on- and offline depending on server availability and player choice; if played offline, the games offered two AI-controlled NPC \"party members\" chosen from the eight possibilities to accompany the player's character.\n\nThe plots of the animated ''Resident Evil'' films, ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'', ''[[Resident Evil: Damnation]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Vendetta]]'' are set between the events of the major installments.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe ''Resident Evil'' franchise has had a variety of control schemes and gameplay mechanics throughout its history. The first game introduced [[tank controls]] to the series. In a game with tank controls, players control movement relative to the position of the [[player character]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/a-eulogy-for-tank-controls/|title=A eulogy for tank controls|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=5 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> Pressing up (for example on a [[D-pad]], [[analog stick]], or [[Arrow keys|cursor movement keys]]) on the [[game controller]] moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them.<ref name=\":0\" /> This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction players push from the perspective of the [[Virtual camera system|camera]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Some critics have posited that the control scheme is intentionally clumsy, meant to enhance stress and exacerbate difficulty.<ref name=historyofRE>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjkr-8lrK2w|title=The History of Resident Evil|website=GameSpot|date=August 13, 2016|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe original game and its sequel featured this tank control scheme, and it was until the third entry, ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'' that more action oriented controls were introduced. The third game included a 180 degree turn and dodge command that, according to ''[[GameSpot]]'', \"hinted at a new direction that the series would go in\".\n\n''Resident Evil 4'' introduced a third-person perspective and more action-oriented gameplay and mechanics. This was complemented by an abundance of ammunition and more action controls. Some critics claimed that this overhauled control scheme \"made the game less scary.\"<ref name=\"historyofRE\" /> The next two games in the franchise furthered the action-oriented mechanics: ''Resident Evil 5'' featured cooperative play, while ''Resident Evil 6'' allowed players to move while aiming and shooting.<ref name=\"historyofRE\" /> ''Resident Evil 5'' contained more ammo than the last games, pushing the game to be decisively more action oriented. ''Resident Evil 7'' is the first main ''Resident Evil'' game to use a first-person perspective and to use [[virtual reality]]. It drew comparisons to modern survival horror games such as ''[[Outlast]]'' and ''[[Slender: The Eight Pages]]''.<ref name=\"historyofRE\" />\n\nPuzzle-solving has figured prominently throughout the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3332740/whats-memorable-resident-evil-puzzle/|title=What\u2019s the Most Memorable \u2018Resident Evil\u2019 Puzzle?|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|first1=Adam|last1=Dodd|date=February 24, 2015|access-date=December 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n{{See also|List of Resident Evil media}}\n\nThe ''Resident Evil'' franchise features video games and tie-in merchandise and products, including various films, comic books, and novels.\n\n=== Comics ===\nIn 1997, [[Marvel Comics]] published a single-issue prologue comic based on the original ''Resident Evil'', released through a promotional giveaway alongside the original PlayStation game.\n\nIn 1998, [[WildStorm]] began producing a monthly comic book series based on the first two games, titled ''Resident Evil: The Official Comic Magazine'', which lasted five issues. The first four issues were published by [[Image Comics|Image]], while the fifth and final issue was published by Wildstorm themselves. Each issue was a compilation of short stories that were both adaptations of events from the games, as well as related side-stories. Like the Perry novels, the comics also explored events occurring beyond ''Resident Evil 2'' (the latest game during the series' publication) and thus were contradicted by later games. Wildstorm also published a four-issue miniseries titled ''Resident Evil: Fire & Ice'', which depicted the ordeal of Charlie Team, a third STARS team created specifically for the comic. In 2009, Wildstorm reprinted ''Fire & Ice'' in a trade paperback collection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090207-nycc09-widlstorm.html|title = NYCC '09 \u2013 Wildstorm Panel with Jim Lee|work=[[Newsarama]]|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, there has been officially licensed ''Biohazard'' [[manhua]] adaptations of ''Biohazard 3'' and ''Code: Veronica'' by Lee Chung Hing. The latter was translated into English and published by Wildstorm as a series of four graphic novel collections.\n\nIn 2009, Wildstorm began publishing a comic book prequel to ''Resident Evil 5'', titled ''Resident Evil'', which centers around two original members of the BSAA named Mina Gere and Holiday Sugarman. Written by Ricardo Sanchez and illustrated by Kevin Sharpe and Jim Clark, the first issue was published on March 11, 2009. On November 11, 2009, the third issue was released and the fourth was released March 24, 2010.

Other merchandise includes an energy drink called \"T-virus Antidote\".\n\n''Resident Evil Archives'' is a reference guide of the ''Resident Evil'' series written by staff members of Capcom. It was translated into English and published by [[BradyGames]]. The guide describes and summarizes all of the key events that occur in ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', ''Resident Evil'', ''Resident Evil 2'', ''Resident Evil 3'', and ''Code: Veronica''. Along with the main plot analysis, it also contains character relationship charts, artwork, item descriptions and file transcripts for all five games. <!-- One part of the guide replaces all instances of the word \"biohazard\" with \"Resident Evil\", even when the situation didn't warrant it (resulting in such goofs such as the UBCS being referred to as the \"Umbrella Resident Evil Countermeasure Service\" at one point), as well as typos and spelling errors throughout. A second Archives book was later released in December 2011 and covers ''Resident Evil 4'', ''Resident Evil 5'',  the new scenarios detailed in ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles'' and ''Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles'', and the 2008 CGI movie, ''Resident Evil: Degeneration''.

The story serves as a prelude to the events of the original ''Resident Evil'', in which Chris investigates the disappearance of his missing friend, Billy Rabbitson.\n\n[[S. D. Perry]] has written novelizations of the first five games, as well as two original novels taking place between games. The novels often take liberties with the plot of the games by exploring events occurring outside and beyond the games. This often meant that the novels would later be contradicted by the games and, on a few occasions.<ref>For example, the novel ''Underworld'' suggested that Raccoon City was destroyed during an accidental fire after the events of ''City of the Dead'', whereas in ''Resident Evil 3'' it is revealed that the city was destroyed by a nuclear missile launched by the government.</ref> One notable addition from the novels is the original character Trent, who often served as a mysterious behind-the-scenes string-puller who aided the main characters. Perry's novels were translated and released in Japan with new cover arts by Wolfina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wolfina.com/snake-heart/ |title=Snake Heart |language=Japanese}}</ref> Perry's novels, particularly ''The Umbrella Conspiracy'', also alluded to events in ''Biohazard: The Beginning'', such as the disappearance of Billy Rabbitson and Brian Irons' bid to run for Mayor.  A reprinting of Perry's novels with new cover artwork began in 2012 to coincide with the release of ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'' and its respective novelization.\n\nThere is a trilogy of original ''Biohazard'' novels in Japan. {{Nihongo|''Hokkai no Y\u014dj\u016b''|\u5317\u6d77\u306e\u5996\u7363||lit. \"The Strange Beast of the North Sea\"}} was published in 1998 and was written by Ky\u016b Asakura and the staff of Flagship. Two additional novels were published in 2002, ''To the Liberty'' by Suien Kimura and ''Rose Blank'' by Tadashi Aizawa. While no official English translation of these novels has been published yet, the last two books were translated into German and published in 2006.\n\nNovelizations of four of the five films; ''Genesis'', ''Apocalypse'', ''Extinction,'' and ''Retribution'', were written by [[Keith DeCandido]], while ''Retribution'' was written by [[John Shirley]], though ''Afterlife'' did not receive a novelization. The ''Genesis'' novel was published over two years after that film's release while the ''Extinction'' novel was released in late July 2007, two months before the film's release. There was also a Japanese novelization of the first film, unrelated to DeCandido's version, written by Osamu Makino. Makino also wrote two novels based on the game ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles''. The books are a two-part direct novelization of the game and have been published in Japanese and German only. The first novel which was titled ''Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side A'' in Japan and ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 1'' in Germany was released on December 22, 2007. The second novel which was titled ''Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side B'' in Japan and ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 2'' in Germany was published in January 2008.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n== Reception ==\nMost of the games in the main ''Resident Evil'' series have been released to positive reviews.

They discover that the mansion conceals the Umbrella Corporation's base where they developed the T-virus with their end-goal being the creation of a bio-weapon known as the Tyrant (for whom the virus named). Playing as either of the characters, the player must navigate the mansion alternately with the help of [[Barry Burton]] or [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]] until they are betrayed by [[Albert Wesker]] who was secretly planning to steal the T-virus. Though appearing to be killed by the Tyrant, Wesker survived and masterminded some later events behind the scenes.\n\n''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', a prequel released originally for the [[GameCube]], details the events leading up to the first game and follows Rebecca Chambers as she is separated from the Bravo team and has to team up with fugitive [[Billy Coen]].\n\n''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' follows a few months after the events of the first game when rats start infecting the population of Raccoon City with the G-virus. Playing alternately as [[Claire Redfield]], the sister of Chris from the first game, or [[Leon S. Kennedy]], a rookie police officer starting on the day of the outbreak. The players must escape from the city while at the same time confronting the mad scientist [[William Birkin]]. The same plot is repeated with minor differences in [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|the 2019 remake]].\n\n''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', set both before and after the events of the second game, follows Jill Valentine's escape from Raccoon City while being pursued by another Umbrella bio-weapon, the Nemesis-T Type. The plot concludes with the sterilization of Raccoon City by a nuclear strike.\n\n=== Post-Raccoon City ===\n''[[Resident Evil \u2013 Code: Veronica]]'' follows Claire's journey after escaping Raccoon City. She is captured trying to break into Umbrella's Paris facility and is transported to one of their research facilities. The facility is attacked by Albert Wesker's forces and becomes also overrun with the T-virus. Claire escapes and starts looking for her brother Chris while having to deal with Alfred and [[Alexia Ashford]]. Unbeknownst to her, Chris finds his way to the island and tracks Claire to the Arctic Umbrella facility. At the game's finale, Chris defeats the genetically-modified Alexia, faces off against Wesker and escapes with Claire.\n\n''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' follows [[Leon S. Kennedy]]'s mission to rescue the daughter of the president of the United States, who has been captured by Los Illuminados, a cult in Spain led by Osmund Saddler. Instead of T-virus infected zombies, Leon faces off against villagers infected with the Las Plagas parasite, which are labeled as Ganados, meaning livestock in Spanish, which makes them unyieldingly murderous but also maintains their dexterity and mobility, unlike the slow, shambling undead.\n\n''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' concerns Chris Redfield's attempts to stop the selling of illegal bio-weapons in Africa, helped by [[Sheva Alomar]]. The bio-weapons in question were developed using the Las Plagas. The plot eventually involves Albert Wesker's plans to destroy humanity with a viral agent based on the Progenitor Virus and T-virus Antibodies called Uroboros.\n\n''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]'' is set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, shortly after the establishment of the counter-terrorism group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). The game follows counter-terrorism agents [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Chris Redfield]] as they try to stop a bioterrorist organization from infecting the Earth's oceans with a virus. \n\n''[[Resident Evil 6]]'' follows multiple protagonists, including [[Leon S. Kennedy]], [[Chris Redfield]], [[Ada Wong]] and [[Jake Muller]], who become involved in a terrorist strike using bio-weapons which results in the zombification of the President of the United States. The story involves a new fast-acting zombie virus called the C-virus which has been weaponized by the NSA to induce fear in the general populace and focuses on the individual characters' attempts to stop it from spreading.\n\nIn ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]'' the plot is set between the events of Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6. The story begins when Claire Redfield and her co-workers, including the newcomer and playable protagonist, Moira Burton, are at a party in the headquarters of the NGO Terra Save, when they are attacked by unknown assailants and taken away to a deserted island, where Barry Burton and Natalia Korda also are involved for different reasons as the other two playable characters of the game.\n\nIn ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', the player controls [[Ethan Winters]], who wants to locate his missing wife, Mia, and has to defend himself against a strange family inside their seemingly abandoned house.\n\n=== Related games and other media ===\nSeveral other games follow the escapades of singular characters. 2003's ''[[Resident Evil: Outbreak]]'' and its 2005 sequel ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2|Resident Evil: Outbreak File #2]]'' instead introduced eight new characters whom the player guides through the Raccoon City incident as they slowly succumb to the T-Virus (or find a cure). These two installments were playable both on- and offline depending on server availability and player choice; if played offline, the games offered two AI-controlled NPC \"party members\" chosen from the eight possibilities to accompany the player's character.\n\nThe plots of the animated ''Resident Evil'' films, ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'', ''[[Resident Evil: Damnation]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Vendetta]]'' are set between the events of the major installments.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe ''Resident Evil'' franchise has had a variety of control schemes and gameplay mechanics throughout its history. The first game introduced [[tank controls]] to the series. In a game with tank controls, players control movement relative to the position of the [[player character]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/a-eulogy-for-tank-controls/|title=A eulogy for tank controls|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=5 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> Pressing up (for example on a [[D-pad]], [[analog stick]], or [[Arrow keys|cursor movement keys]]) on the [[game controller]] moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them.<ref name=\":0\" /> This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction players push from the perspective of the [[Virtual camera system|camera]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Some critics have posited that the control scheme is intentionally clumsy, meant to enhance stress and exacerbate difficulty.<ref name=historyofRE>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjkr-8lrK2w|title=The History of Resident Evil|website=GameSpot|date=August 13, 2016|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe original game and its sequel featured this tank control scheme, and it was until the third entry, ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'' that more action oriented controls were introduced. The third game included a 180 degree turn and dodge command that, according to ''[[GameSpot]]'', \"hinted at a new direction that the series would go in\".\n\n''Resident Evil 4'' introduced a third-person perspective and more action-oriented gameplay and mechanics. This was complemented by an abundance of ammunition and more action controls. Some critics claimed that this overhauled control scheme \"made the game less scary.\"<ref name=\"historyofRE\" /> The next two games in the franchise furthered the action-oriented mechanics: ''Resident Evil 5'' featured cooperative play, while ''Resident Evil 6'' allowed players to move while aiming and shooting.<ref name=\"historyofRE\" /> ''Resident Evil 5'' contained more ammo than the last games, pushing the game to be decisively more action oriented. ''Resident Evil 7'' is the first main ''Resident Evil'' game to use a first-person perspective and to use [[virtual reality]]. It drew comparisons to modern survival horror games such as ''[[Outlast]]'' and ''[[Slender: The Eight Pages]]''.<ref name=\"historyofRE\" />\n\nPuzzle-solving has figured prominently throughout the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3332740/whats-memorable-resident-evil-puzzle/|title=What\u2019s the Most Memorable \u2018Resident Evil\u2019 Puzzle?|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|first1=Adam|last1=Dodd|date=February 24, 2015|access-date=December 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n{{See also|List of Resident Evil media}}\n\nThe ''Resident Evil'' franchise features video games and tie-in merchandise and products, including various films, comic books, and novels.\n\n=== Comics ===\nIn 1997, [[Marvel Comics]] published a single-issue prologue comic based on the original ''Resident Evil'', released through a promotional giveaway alongside the original PlayStation game.\n\nIn 1998, [[WildStorm]] began producing a monthly comic book series based on the first two games, titled ''Resident Evil: The Official Comic Magazine'', which lasted five issues. The first four issues were published by [[Image Comics|Image]], while the fifth and final issue was published by Wildstorm themselves. Each issue was a compilation of short stories that were both adaptations of events from the games, as well as related side-stories. Like the Perry novels, the comics also explored events occurring beyond ''Resident Evil 2'' (the latest game during the series' publication) and thus were contradicted by later games. Wildstorm also published a four-issue miniseries titled ''Resident Evil: Fire & Ice'', which depicted the ordeal of Charlie Team, a third STARS team created specifically for the comic. In 2009, Wildstorm reprinted ''Fire & Ice'' in a trade paperback collection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090207-nycc09-widlstorm.html|title = NYCC '09 \u2013 Wildstorm Panel with Jim Lee|work=[[Newsarama]]|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, there has been officially licensed ''Biohazard'' [[manhua]] adaptations of ''Biohazard 3'' and ''Code: Veronica'' by Lee Chung Hing. The latter was translated into English and published by Wildstorm as a series of four graphic novel collections.\n\nIn 2009, Wildstorm began publishing a comic book prequel to ''Resident Evil 5'', titled ''Resident Evil'', which centers around two original members of the BSAA named Mina Gere and Holiday Sugarman. Written by Ricardo Sanchez and illustrated by Kevin Sharpe and Jim Clark, the first issue was published on March 11, 2009. On November 11, 2009, the third issue was released and the fourth was released March 24, 2010.

Other merchandise includes an energy drink called \"T-virus Antidote\".\n\n''Resident Evil Archives'' is a reference guide of the ''Resident Evil'' series written by staff members of Capcom. It was translated into English and published by [[BradyGames]]. The guide describes and summarizes all of the key events that occur in ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', ''Resident Evil'', ''Resident Evil 2'', ''Resident Evil 3'', and ''Code: Veronica''. Along with the main plot analysis, it also contains character relationship charts, artwork, item descriptions and file transcripts for all five games. <!-- One part of the guide replaces all instances of the word \"biohazard\" with \"Resident Evil\", even when the situation didn't warrant it (resulting in such goofs such as the UBCS being referred to as the \"Umbrella Resident Evil Countermeasure Service\" at one point), as well as typos and spelling errors throughout. A second Archives book was later released in December 2011 and covers ''Resident Evil 4'', ''Resident Evil 5'',  the new scenarios detailed in ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles'' and ''Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles'', and the 2008 CGI movie, ''Resident Evil: Degeneration''.

The story serves as a prelude to the events of the original ''Resident Evil'', in which Chris investigates the disappearance of his missing friend, Billy Rabbitson.\n\n[[S. D. Perry]] has written novelizations of the first five games, as well as two original novels taking place between games. The novels often take liberties with the plot of the games by exploring events occurring outside and beyond the games. This often meant that the novels would later be contradicted by the games and, on a few occasions.<ref>For example, the novel ''Underworld'' suggested that Raccoon City was destroyed during an accidental fire after the events of ''City of the Dead'', whereas in ''Resident Evil 3'' it is revealed that the city was destroyed by a nuclear missile launched by the government.</ref> One notable addition from the novels is the original character Trent, who often served as a mysterious behind-the-scenes string-puller who aided the main characters. Perry's novels were translated and released in Japan with new cover arts by Wolfina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wolfina.com/snake-heart/ |title=Snake Heart |language=Japanese}}</ref> Perry's novels, particularly ''The Umbrella Conspiracy'', also alluded to events in ''Biohazard: The Beginning'', such as the disappearance of Billy Rabbitson and Brian Irons' bid to run for Mayor.  A reprinting of Perry's novels with new cover artwork began in 2012 to coincide with the release of ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'' and its respective novelization.\n\nThere is a trilogy of original ''Biohazard'' novels in Japan. {{Nihongo|''Hokkai no Y\u014dj\u016b''|\u5317\u6d77\u306e\u5996\u7363||lit. \"The Strange Beast of the North Sea\"}} was published in 1998 and was written by Ky\u016b Asakura and the staff of Flagship. Two additional novels were published in 2002, ''To the Liberty'' by Suien Kimura and ''Rose Blank'' by Tadashi Aizawa. While no official English translation of these novels has been published yet, the last two books were translated into German and published in 2006.\n\nNovelizations of four of the five films; ''Genesis'', ''Apocalypse'', ''Extinction,'' and ''Retribution'', were written by [[Keith DeCandido]], while ''Retribution'' was written by [[John Shirley]], though ''Afterlife'' did not receive a novelization. The ''Genesis'' novel was published over two years after that film's release while the ''Extinction'' novel was released in late July 2007, two months before the film's release. There was also a Japanese novelization of the first film, unrelated to DeCandido's version, written by Osamu Makino. Makino also wrote two novels based on the game ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles''. The books are a two-part direct novelization of the game and have been published in Japanese and German only. The first novel which was titled ''Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side A'' in Japan and ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 1'' in Germany was released on December 22, 2007. The second novel which was titled ''Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side B'' in Japan and ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 2'' in Germany was published in January 2008.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n== Reception ==\nMost of the games in the main ''Resident Evil'' series have been released to positive reviews.

By the mid-19th century, however, the [[British Empire]] gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of [[free trade]], with few restrictions or [[tariff]]s. [[Christian mission]]aries were active in practically all of the European-controlled colonies because the metropoles were Christian.

[[Phoenicia]] was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC and later the Greeks and Persians continued on this line of setting up colonies. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] would soon follow, setting up colonies throughout the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, and Western Asia. Beginning in the 7th century, [[Arab Empire|Arabs]] colonized a substantial portion of the Middle East, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia and Europe. In the 9th century a new wave of [[Mediterranean]] colonisation had begun between competing states such as the [[Stato da M\u00e0r|Venetians]], [[Genoese colonies|Genovese]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfians]], invading the wealthy previously [[Byzantine]] or [[Eastern Roman]] islands and lands. [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] began with the conquest of Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|acquisition of three octaves]] of the Byzantine Empire.<ref>Peter N.

Spain (initially the [[Crown of Castile]]) and soon later Portugal encountered the [[Americas]] through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extensions of land.

There was, though, some [[Russian colonisation of the Americas]] across the Bering Strait. The [[Empire of Japan]] modelled itself on European colonial empires. [[Argentina]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]] fought for hegemony in South America. The United States of America gained overseas territories after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] for which the term \"[[American imperialism|American Empire]]\" was coined.<ref>Benjamin,  ed.

These territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence.  The empires of Russia and Austria also collapsed.<ref>G.M.

This was caused by a number of reasons. First, the Japanese victories in the Pacific War showed Indians and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible. Second, all the colonial powers were significantly weakened by World War II.<ref>Nicholas White, ''Decolonisation'' (2014).</ref>\n\nDozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were instrumental in the decolonisation efforts of former colonies. These included significant wars of independence fought in Indonesia, Vietnam, Algeria, and Kenya. Eventually, the European powers\u2014pressured by the United States and Soviets\u2014resigned themselves to decolonisation.\n\nIn 1962 the [[United Nations]] set up a [[Special Committee on Decolonisation]], often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process.\n\n===European empires in the 20th century===\nThe major European empires consisted of the following colonies at the start of [[World War I]] (former colonies of the Spanish Empire became independent before 1914 and are not listed; former colonies of other European empires that previously became independent, such as the former French colony Haiti, are not listed).\n[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial Governor of the [[Seychelles]] inspecting police guard of honour in 1972]]\n\nThe world's colonial population at the time of the First World War totalled about 560 million people, of whom 70% were in British domains, 10% in French, 9% in Dutch, 4% in Japanese, 2% in German, 2% in American, 2% in Portuguese, 1% in Belgian and 1/2 of 1% in Italian possessions. The home domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about 370 million people.<ref>The Russian Empire, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Spain and Denmark are not included.

Apart from the British Empire, they were not favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus populations.<ref>Raymond Leslie Buell, \"Do Colonies Pay?\" [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1936aug01-00006?View=PDF ''The Saturday Review'', August 1, 1936 p 6 ]</ref> The question of whether colonies paid is, however, a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved. In some cases colonial powers were paying a lot in military costs, while the benefits could be pocketed by private investors. In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes.<ref>R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck & Broberg (2019) Capital and Colonialism.

Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation, rather, colonialism by other means. Specifically, neocolonialism refers to the theory that former or existing economic relationships, such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]], or through companies (such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[Brunei]]) created by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of their former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post\u2013World War II period.\n\nThe term was popular in ex-colonies in the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Uzoigw |first=Godfrey N. |year=2019 |title=Neocolonialism Is Dead: Long Live Neocolonialism |journal=Journal of Global South Studies |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=59\u201387 |doi=10.1353/gss.2019.0004}}</ref>\n\n==List of colonies==\n=== British colonies and protectorates ===\n[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, [[Kingston, Jamaica]], c. 1820]]\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879.

In \"Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-run Growth\", economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] compare the economic influences of the European colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous European colonies, for example, between West African colonies like [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name=\"Institutions\">{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3 |chapter = Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|volume = 1A|pages = 385\u2013472|title = Handbook of Economic Growth|year = 2005|last1 = Acemoglu|first1 = Daron|last2 = Johnson|first2 = Simon|last3 = Robinson|first3 = James A.|isbn = 9780444520418|chapter-url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4469}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the paper, economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources. At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions \u2013 especially how [[de facto]] and [[de jure]] political power is allocated. To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions.<ref name=\"Institutions\" />\n[[File:A Castro, Lorenzo - A Dutch East-Indiaman off Hoorn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Dutch East India Company]] was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]].]]\nFor example, one interesting observation is \"the Reversal of Fortune\" \u2013 the less developed civilisations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas. One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area. Therefore, given a more developed civilisation and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests. Political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems, which determined the colonial economic performance.<ref name=\"Institutions\" />\n\nEuropean colonisation and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world. In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control. For example, in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights. While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village's food supply or their individual family's land. This allowed women to achieve power and autonomy, even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/25 |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women |last=Freedman |first=Estelle |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/25 25\u201326]}}</ref>\n\nThrough the rise of European colonialism came a large push for development and industrialisation of most economic systems. However, when working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers. Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men. In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level. The result was a technologic, economic, and class-based gender gap that widened over time.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/113 |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women |last=Freedman |first=Estelle |publisher=Random House Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/113 113]}}</ref>\n\nWithin a colony, the presence of extractive colonial institutions in a given area has been found have effects on the modern day economic development, institutions and infrastructure of these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/restud/rdz017 | title=The Development Effects of the Extractive Colonial Economy: The Dutch Cultivation System in Java| journal=The Review of Economic Studies| volume=87| pages=164\u2013203| year=2020| last1=Dell| first1=Melissa| last2=Olken| first2=Benjamin A.|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/dell/publications/development-effects-extractive-colonial-economy-dutch-cultivation-system-java}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0010414015600465 | title= Colonial Legacies and State Institutions in China: Evidence From a Natural Experiment| journal=Comparative Political Studies| volume=50| issue=4| pages=434\u2013463| year=2017| last1=Mattingly| first1=Daniel C.|url=http://daniel-mattingly.com/s/Mattingly_CPS_Preprint.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery and indentured servitude===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade|Indentured servant|Coolie|Blackbirding}}\n[[File:Slave memorial Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|Slave memorial in [[Zanzibar]].

Exploitation of non-Europeans and other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers. Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were slavery and indentured servitude. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants.<ref>\"[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009091039/http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2014-10-09 }}\", by Richard Hofstadter, Montgomery College</ref>\n\nEuropean slave traders brought large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail. Spain and Portugal had [[Atlantic slave trade|brought African slaves]] to work at African colonies such as [[Cape Verde]] and the [[Azores]], and then Latin America, by the 16th century. The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries. Approximately, around 11 million Africans were taken to the Caribbean and North and South America as slaves by European colonisers.<ref name=\"King 2010 24\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/24 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |page=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/24 24]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gor\u00e9e-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright|Slave traders in Gor\u00e9e, [[Senegal]], 18th century]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonisers to develop a new source of labour, using a system of indentured servitude. [[Indentured servant]]s consented to a contract with the European colonisers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well. The employee was \"indentured\" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages. In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts created by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony.\n\nIndia and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more indentured servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/26 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/26 26\u201327]}}</ref>l\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa and the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition.<ref name=\"Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012\" />\n\n===Military innovation===\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[First Anglo-Ashanti War]], 1823\u201331]]\nConquering forces have throughout history applied innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer. Greeks developed the [[phalanx]] system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield. Under [[Philip II of Macedon]], they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peoples and Empires |last=Pagden |first=Anthony |publisher=Modern Library |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8129-6761-6 |location=New York |page=6}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great]] exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.\n\nThe Spanish Empire held a major advantage over [[Mesoamerican]] warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the [[Aztec civilisation]] and others. The use of [[gunpowder]] weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.\n\n===The end of empire===\n[[File:Lord Pethic-Lawrence and Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] with [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Lord Pethwick-Lawrence]], British Secretary of State for India, after a meeting on 18 April 1946]]\nThe populations of some colonial territories, such as Canada, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power, at least among the majority; however, minority populations such as [[First Nations]] peoples and French-Canadians experienced [[marginalisation]] and resented colonial practises. Francophone residents of [[Quebec]], for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the [[Conscription crisis of 1917]]. Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population. Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's [[Sepoy Rebellion]].\n\nThe territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another. European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control. Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators. Once independence from European control was achieved, civil war erupted in some former colonies, as native populations fought to capture territory for their own ethnic, cultural or political group.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The [[Partition of India]], a 1947 civil war that came in the aftermath of India's independence from Britain, became a conflict with 500,000 killed. Fighting erupted between Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities as they fought for territorial dominance. Muslims fought for an independent country to be partitioned where they would not be a religious minority, resulting in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things |title-link=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things |last=White |first=Matthew |publisher=W.W.

In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace. 900,000 French colonists (known as the ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'') resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962. A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent. 800,000 people of [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso#The retornados|Portuguese]] origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between 1974 and 1979; 300,000 settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the [[Dutch West Indies]] after Dutch military control of the colony ended.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/35 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |page=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/35 35]}}</ref>\n\nAfter WWII 300,000 Dutchmen from the [[Dutch East Indies]], of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called [[Indo people|Indo Europeans]], repatriated to the Netherlands.

Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation. For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 |publisher=The National Archives, United Kingdom |access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies.\n\nIn some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members. A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France, the [[Francophonie]]; the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the [[Dutch Language Union]] is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands.\n\nMigration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies. Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] countries of north Africa and the majority population of France. Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of \"inner Paris\" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 45038321|title = Cultural Conflicts: North African Immigrants in France|journal = International Journal of Peace Studies|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 67\u201375|last1 = Seljuq|first1 = Affan|year = 1997|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol2_2/seljuq.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Introduced diseases===\n{{See also|Globalisation and disease|Columbian Exchange|Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonization}}\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\n\nEncounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.<ref>Kenneth F.

From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol. The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies.\n\nThe empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by [[Alexander the Great]], spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies. While most Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others (the word [[barbarian]] is derived from mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like \"bar-bar\"), Alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] of the Persians. He [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html adopted Persian customs of clothing] and otherwise encouraged his men to [[wikt:go native|go native]] by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms. Of note is that he radically departed from earlier Greek attempts at colonisation, characterised by the [[History of the Peloponnesian War|murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants]] and the settling of Greek citizens from the polis.\n\nRoman universalism was characterised by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law. [[Roman law]] was imposed on both Roman citizens and colonial subjects. Although Imperial Rome had [[Education in ancient Rome|no public education]], [[Latin]] spread through its use in government and trade. Roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves, which was responsible for the 200 year long [[Pax Romana]], at the time the longest period of peace in history. The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, even allowing them on a few occasions to [[Hyrcanus II|threaten Roman authority]].\n\n===Colonialism and geography===\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-99-01.jpg|thumb|[[British Togoland]] in 1953]]\n\nSettlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony, thus bridging the geographical, ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised.

The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate. Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the centre of the map. As [[J.B.

Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available&nbsp;... When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of [[underdevelopment]]&nbsp;... During the centuries of pre-colonial trade, some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism. Colonialism went much further than trade. It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa. Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society. Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards&nbsp;... Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called 'mother country'. From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources. It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped.\n\n:\"Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector. As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwSSkemSJLcC&pg=PA224 |title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa |last=Walter Rodney |publisher=East African Publishers |isbn=978-9966-25-113-8 |pages=149, 224|year=1972 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyiZafDHpqoC&pg=PA271 |title=A Companion To Postcolonial Studies |last=Henry Schwarz |last2=Sangeeta Ray |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-470-99833-5 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from [[free trade]] to a stage of [[monopoly]] [[capitalism]] to finance [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. He states it is, \"connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world\". As [[free trade]] thrives on [[exports]] of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry. This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism. He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing. War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism. As a continuation of this thought G.N. Uzoigwe states, \"But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses.\"<ref>Boahen, A. Adu.

In this sense, one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of [[postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said|Edward Sa\u00efd]]'s book  [[Orientalism (book)|''Orientalism'']] (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] (1913\u20132008) and [[Frantz Fanon]] (1925\u20131961) made similar claims decades before Sa\u00efd).\n\nSa\u00efd analyzed the works of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]], arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to [[Subaltern Studies]].\n\nIn ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak argued that major works of European [[metaphysics]] (such as those of  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers  [[Western culture|Western civilisation]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also had some traces of  [[Racism|racialism]] in his work.\n\n=== Colonistics ===\nThe field of '''colonistics''' studies colonialism from such viewpoints as those of economics, sociology and psychology.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZCAAAAAQBAJ |title=The Sociology of the Colonies [Part 1]: An Introduction to the Study of Race Contact |last=Maunier |first=Ren\u00e9 |publisher=Routledge |year=1949 |isbn=978-1-136-24522-0 |series=International Library of Sociology |publication-date=2013 |page=137 |translator-last=Lorimer |translator-first=E.-O. |quote=There are thus three elements in Colonistics or colonial study: Colonial ''Economics'', Colonial ''Sociology'' and Colonial ''Psychology''. |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects of Colonialism on the Colonisers ===\n[[File:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and the Prime Minister of United Kingdom (UK), Mr. David Cameron interacting with the school children, at Wembley Stadium, in London on November 13, 2015.jpg|thumb|Since 1945, [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] to the United Kingdom under [[British nationality law]] has been significant, in particular from the former [[British Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qj8GEjW91oEC |title=Citizenship and Immigration in Postwar Britain |last=Randall Hansen |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780191583018}}</ref>]]\nIn his 1955 essay, ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Discours sur le colonialisme''), French poet [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] evaluates the effects of racist, sexist, and capitalist attitudes and motivations on the civilisations that attempted to colonise other civilisations. In explaining his position, he says \"I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilisations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever its own particular genius may be, a civilisation that withdraws into itself atrophies; that for civilisations, exchange is oxygen.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=Discourse on colonialism |first=Aim\u00e9 |last=C\u00e9saire <!-- |date=1972 --> |publisher=Monthly Review Press |year=1955 |location=New York and London |pages=2 |oclc=849914517}}</ref> However, he contends that colonisation is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighbouring civilisations.\n\nTo illustrate his point, he explains that colonisation relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanise the targets of colonisation and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment. Every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonisers onto the colonised is justified by racist, sexist, otherwise xenophobic, or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people, the colonising civilisation \"acquires another dead weight, a universal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a centre of infection begins to spread.\" <ref name=\":2\" /> C\u00e9saire argues the result of this process is that \"a poison [is] instilled into the veins of Europe and, slowly but surely, the continent proceeds toward ''savagery''.\" <ref>{{Cite book |title=Discourse on colonialism. |first=Aim\u00e9 |last=C\u00e9saire <!-- |date=1972 --> |publisher=Monthly Review Press |year=1955 |location=New York and London |pages=3 |oclc=849914517}}</ref>  C\u00e9saire is indicating that the racist and xenophobic justifications for colonisation\u2014motivated by capitalist desires\u2014ultimately result in the moral and cultural degradation of the colonising nation. Thusly, colonisation is damaging to the civilisations that participate as perpetrators in a way that is internally harmful.\n\n==British public opinion about the British Empire==\nThe 2014 [[YouGov]] survey found that British people are mostly proud of colonialism and the [[British Empire]]:<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/colonial-nostalgia-horrors-of-empire-britain-olympic |title=Colonial nostalgia is back in fashion, blinding us to the horrors of empire |date=24 August 2016 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A new YouGov survey finds that most think the British Empire is more something to be proud of (59%) rather than ashamed of (19%). 23% don't know.

Some intended to remain in the colonies as temporary settlers, mainly as military personnel or on business. Others went to the colonies as immigrants. British people were by far the most numerous population to migrate to the colonies: 2.5 million settled in Canada; 1.5 million in Australia; 750,000 in New Zealand; 450,000 in the Union of South Africa; and 200,000 in India. French citizens also migrated in large numbers, mainly to the colonies in the north African [[Maghreb]] region: 1.3 million settled in Algeria; 200,000 in Morocco; 100,000 in Tunisia; while only 20,000 migrated to French Indochina. Dutch and German colonies saw relatively scarce European migration, since Dutch and German colonial expansion focused on commercial goals rather than settlement. Portugal sent 150,000 settlers to Angola, 80,000 to Mozambique, and 20,000 to Goa. During the Spanish Empire, approximately 550,000 Spanish settlers migrated to [[Latin America]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/34 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26151-8 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/34 34\u201335]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes|gap=2em}}\n* [[African independence movements]]\n* [[Age of Discovery]]\n* [[American imperialism|American Empire]]\n* [[Anti-imperialism]]\n* [[Chartered companies]]\n* [[Chinese imperialism]]\n* [[Christianity and colonialism]]\n* [[Civilising mission]]\n* [[Colonial Empire]]\n* [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games]]\n* [[Coloniality of power]]\n* [[Colonial wars]]\n* [[Colonies in antiquity]]\n* [[Colonisation]]\n* [[Colony]]\n* [[Decoloniality]]\n* [[Decolonisation]]\n* [[Direct colonial rule]]\n* [[Empire of Liberty]]\n* [[European colonial empires]]\n* [[European colonization of Africa]]\n* [[European colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[European colonization of Micronesia]]\n* [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia]]\n* [[French law on colonialism]]\n* [[German eastward expansion]]\n* [[Global Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation]]\n* [[Imperialism]]\n* [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)]]\n* [[Muslim conquests]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n* [[Pluricontinental]]\n* [[Postcolonialism]]\n* [[Protectorate]]\n* [[Settler colonialism]]\n* [[Soviet Empire|Soviet Empire]]\n* [[Special Committee on Decolonisation]]\n* [[Stranger King (Concept)]]\n* [[Western imperialism in Asia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Albertini, Rudolf von.

[[Empire of Japan| Japan]], the [[American imperialism| United States]] and [[Chinese imperialism |China]] also followed this path, as did the [[German colonial empire| Germans]] and the [[Italian Empire| Italians]] in the late 19th century.\n\nAt first, European colonising countries followed policies of [[mercantilism]], aiming to strengthen the home-country economy, so agreements usually restricted the colonies to trading only with the [[metropole]] (mother country). By the mid-19th century, however, the [[British Empire]] gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of [[free trade]], with few restrictions or [[tariff]]s. [[Christian mission]]aries were active in practically all of the European-controlled colonies because the metropoles were Christian. Historian Philip Hoffman calculated that by 1800, before the [[Industrial Revolution]], Europeans already controlled at least 35% of the globe, and by 1914, they had gained control of 84% of the globe.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=73zeBgAAQBAJ |title= Why Did Europe Conquer the World? |last= Philip T.

This category includes [[trading posts]] as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration.

Colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the [[mestizo]]s of the Americas, as well as racially divided populations such as those found in [[French Algeria]] or in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed.\n\nNotable examples in Asia include the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]], [[Anglo-Indian]], [[Burgher people|Burgher]], [[Eurasian Singaporean]], [[Filipino mestizo]], [[Kristang people|Kristang]] and [[Macanese people]]s. In the [[Dutch East Indies]] (later [[Indonesia]]) the vast majority of \"Dutch\" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as [[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]], formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony (see also [[Indos in pre-colonial history]] and [[Indos in colonial history]]).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47wCTCJX9X4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA223 |title=Being \"Dutch\" in the Indies: A History of Creolisation and Empire, 1500\u20131920 |last=Bosma |first=U. |last2=Raben |first2=R. |date=2008 |publisher=NUS Press |isbn=978-9971-69-373-2 |location=Singapore |page=223}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nN6G-lMk_DEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA163 |title=Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies 1900\u20131942 |last=Gouda |first=Frances |date=2008 |publisher=Equinox |isbn=978-979-3780-62-7 |page=163 |chapter=Gender, Race, and Sexuality}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of colonialism|Chronology of Western colonialism}}\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"150\">\nColonial empires in 1800.svg|Map of colonial empires throughout the world in 1800 CE.\nWorld 1914 empires colonies territory.PNG|Map of colonial empires throughout the world in 1914 CE.\nWorld 1936 empires colonies territory.png|Map of colonial empires throughout the world in 1936 CE.\nColonization 1945.png|Map of colonial empires at the end of the Second World War, 1945 CE.\n</gallery>\n{{quote box|width=25%|quote=\"Why do the Christian nations, which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?\"...\"Because they have laws and rules invented by reason.\"|source=[[Ibrahim Muteferrika]], ''Rational basis for the Politics of Nations'' (1731)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/niall_ferguson_the_6_killer_apps_of_prosperity.html |title=The 6 killer apps of prosperity |date=11 August 2017 |website=Ted.com |access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Premodern===\nActivity that could be called colonialism has a long history starting with the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] who all built [[colonies in antiquity]]. [[Phoenicia]] was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC and later the Greeks and Persians continued on this line of setting up colonies. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] would soon follow, setting up colonies throughout the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, and Western Asia. Beginning in the 7th century, [[Arab Empire|Arabs]] colonized a substantial portion of the Middle East, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia and Europe. In the 9th century a new wave of [[Mediterranean]] colonisation had begun between competing states such as the [[Stato da M\u00e0r|Venetians]], [[Genoese colonies|Genovese]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfians]], invading the wealthy previously [[Byzantine]] or [[Eastern Roman]] islands and lands. [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] began with the conquest of Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|acquisition of three octaves]] of the Byzantine Empire.<ref>Peter N.

Spain (initially the [[Crown of Castile]]) and soon later Portugal encountered the [[Americas]] through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extensions of land. For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of [[expansionism]]. These new lands were divided between the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portuguese Empire]] .<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Portuguese Seaborne Empire, 1415\u20131825'' (1969)</ref>\n\nThe 17th century saw the creation of the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[Dutch Empire]], as well as the [[English overseas possessions]], which later became the [[British Empire]]. It also saw the establishment of a [[Danish colonial empire]] and some [[Swedish overseas colonies]].<ref>Thomas Benjamin,  ed. ''Encyclopedia of Western Colonialism Since 1450'' (3 vol 2006)</ref>\n\nA first wave of independence was started by the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), initiating a new phase for the British Empire.<ref>See [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/empire/Empire.html  David Cody, \"The British Empire\" ''The Victorians Web'' (1988)]</ref> The Spanish Empire largely collapsed in the Americas with the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. However, many new colonies were established after this time, including the [[German colonial empire]] and [[Belgian colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, many European powers were involved in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Melvin E. Page, ed., ''Colonialism: An International Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] existed at the same time as the above empires but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of the conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some [[Russian colonisation of the Americas]] across the Bering Strait. The [[Empire of Japan]] modelled itself on European colonial empires. [[Argentina]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]] fought for hegemony in South America. The United States of America gained overseas territories after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] for which the term \"[[American imperialism|American Empire]]\" was coined.<ref>Benjamin,  ed.

These territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence.  The empires of Russia and Austria also collapsed.<ref>G.M.

This was caused by a number of reasons. First, the Japanese victories in the Pacific War showed Indians and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible. Second, all the colonial powers were significantly weakened by World War II.<ref>Nicholas White, ''Decolonisation'' (2014).</ref>\n\nDozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were instrumental in the decolonisation efforts of former colonies. These included significant wars of independence fought in Indonesia, Vietnam, Algeria, and Kenya. Eventually, the European powers\u2014pressured by the United States and Soviets\u2014resigned themselves to decolonisation.\n\nIn 1962 the [[United Nations]] set up a [[Special Committee on Decolonisation]], often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process.\n\n===European empires in the 20th century===\nThe major European empires consisted of the following colonies at the start of [[World War I]] (former colonies of the Spanish Empire became independent before 1914 and are not listed; former colonies of other European empires that previously became independent, such as the former French colony Haiti, are not listed).\n[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial Governor of the [[Seychelles]] inspecting police guard of honour in 1972]]\n\nThe world's colonial population at the time of the First World War totalled about 560 million people, of whom 70% were in British domains, 10% in French, 9% in Dutch, 4% in Japanese, 2% in German, 2% in American, 2% in Portuguese, 1% in Belgian and 1/2 of 1% in Italian possessions. The home domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about 370 million people.<ref>The Russian Empire, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Spain and Denmark are not included.

Apart from the British Empire, they were not favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus populations.<ref>Raymond Leslie Buell, \"Do Colonies Pay?\" [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1936aug01-00006?View=PDF ''The Saturday Review'', August 1, 1936 p 6 ]</ref> The question of whether colonies paid is, however, a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved. In some cases colonial powers were paying a lot in military costs, while the benefits could be pocketed by private investors. In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes.<ref>R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck & Broberg (2019) Capital and Colonialism.

Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation, rather, colonialism by other means. Specifically, neocolonialism refers to the theory that former or existing economic relationships, such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]], or through companies (such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[Brunei]]) created by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of their former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post\u2013World War II period.\n\nThe term was popular in ex-colonies in the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Uzoigw |first=Godfrey N. |year=2019 |title=Neocolonialism Is Dead: Long Live Neocolonialism |journal=Journal of Global South Studies |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=59\u201387 |doi=10.1353/gss.2019.0004}}</ref>\n\n==List of colonies==\n=== British colonies and protectorates ===\n[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, [[Kingston, Jamaica]], c. 1820]]\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879.

In \"Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-run Growth\", economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] compare the economic influences of the European colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous European colonies, for example, between West African colonies like [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name=\"Institutions\">{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3 |chapter = Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|volume = 1A|pages = 385\u2013472|title = Handbook of Economic Growth|year = 2005|last1 = Acemoglu|first1 = Daron|last2 = Johnson|first2 = Simon|last3 = Robinson|first3 = James A.|isbn = 9780444520418|chapter-url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4469}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the paper, economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources. At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions \u2013 especially how [[de facto]] and [[de jure]] political power is allocated. To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions.<ref name=\"Institutions\" />\n[[File:A Castro, Lorenzo - A Dutch East-Indiaman off Hoorn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Dutch East India Company]] was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]].]]\nFor example, one interesting observation is \"the Reversal of Fortune\" \u2013 the less developed civilisations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas. One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area. Therefore, given a more developed civilisation and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests. Political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems, which determined the colonial economic performance.<ref name=\"Institutions\" />\n\nEuropean colonisation and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world. In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control. For example, in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights. While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village's food supply or their individual family's land. This allowed women to achieve power and autonomy, even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/25 |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women |last=Freedman |first=Estelle |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/25 25\u201326]}}</ref>\n\nThrough the rise of European colonialism came a large push for development and industrialisation of most economic systems. However, when working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers. Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men. In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level. The result was a technologic, economic, and class-based gender gap that widened over time.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/113 |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women |last=Freedman |first=Estelle |publisher=Random House Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/113 113]}}</ref>\n\nWithin a colony, the presence of extractive colonial institutions in a given area has been found have effects on the modern day economic development, institutions and infrastructure of these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/restud/rdz017 | title=The Development Effects of the Extractive Colonial Economy: The Dutch Cultivation System in Java| journal=The Review of Economic Studies| volume=87| pages=164\u2013203| year=2020| last1=Dell| first1=Melissa| last2=Olken| first2=Benjamin A.|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/dell/publications/development-effects-extractive-colonial-economy-dutch-cultivation-system-java}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0010414015600465 | title= Colonial Legacies and State Institutions in China: Evidence From a Natural Experiment| journal=Comparative Political Studies| volume=50| issue=4| pages=434\u2013463| year=2017| last1=Mattingly| first1=Daniel C.|url=http://daniel-mattingly.com/s/Mattingly_CPS_Preprint.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery and indentured servitude===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade|Indentured servant|Coolie|Blackbirding}}\n[[File:Slave memorial Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|Slave memorial in [[Zanzibar]].

Exploitation of non-Europeans and other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers. Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were slavery and indentured servitude. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants.<ref>\"[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009091039/http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2014-10-09 }}\", by Richard Hofstadter, Montgomery College</ref>\n\nEuropean slave traders brought large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail. Spain and Portugal had [[Atlantic slave trade|brought African slaves]] to work at African colonies such as [[Cape Verde]] and the [[Azores]], and then Latin America, by the 16th century. The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries. Approximately, around 11 million Africans were taken to the Caribbean and North and South America as slaves by European colonisers.<ref name=\"King 2010 24\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/24 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |page=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/24 24]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gor\u00e9e-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright|Slave traders in Gor\u00e9e, [[Senegal]], 18th century]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonisers to develop a new source of labour, using a system of indentured servitude. [[Indentured servant]]s consented to a contract with the European colonisers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well. The employee was \"indentured\" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages. In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts created by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony.\n\nIndia and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more indentured servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/26 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/26 26\u201327]}}</ref>l\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa and the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition.<ref name=\"Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012\" />\n\n===Military innovation===\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[First Anglo-Ashanti War]], 1823\u201331]]\nConquering forces have throughout history applied innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer. Greeks developed the [[phalanx]] system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield. Under [[Philip II of Macedon]], they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peoples and Empires |last=Pagden |first=Anthony |publisher=Modern Library |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8129-6761-6 |location=New York |page=6}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great]] exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.\n\nThe Spanish Empire held a major advantage over [[Mesoamerican]] warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the [[Aztec civilisation]] and others. The use of [[gunpowder]] weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.\n\n===The end of empire===\n[[File:Lord Pethic-Lawrence and Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] with [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Lord Pethwick-Lawrence]], British Secretary of State for India, after a meeting on 18 April 1946]]\nThe populations of some colonial territories, such as Canada, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power, at least among the majority; however, minority populations such as [[First Nations]] peoples and French-Canadians experienced [[marginalisation]] and resented colonial practises. Francophone residents of [[Quebec]], for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the [[Conscription crisis of 1917]]. Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population. Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's [[Sepoy Rebellion]].\n\nThe territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another. European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control. Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators. Once independence from European control was achieved, civil war erupted in some former colonies, as native populations fought to capture territory for their own ethnic, cultural or political group.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The [[Partition of India]], a 1947 civil war that came in the aftermath of India's independence from Britain, became a conflict with 500,000 killed. Fighting erupted between Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities as they fought for territorial dominance. Muslims fought for an independent country to be partitioned where they would not be a religious minority, resulting in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things |title-link=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things |last=White |first=Matthew |publisher=W.W.

In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace. 900,000 French colonists (known as the ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'') resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962. A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent. 800,000 people of [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso#The retornados|Portuguese]] origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between 1974 and 1979; 300,000 settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the [[Dutch West Indies]] after Dutch military control of the colony ended.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/35 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26124-2 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |page=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/35 35]}}</ref>\n\nAfter WWII 300,000 Dutchmen from the [[Dutch East Indies]], of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called [[Indo people|Indo Europeans]], repatriated to the Netherlands.

Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation. For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 |publisher=The National Archives, United Kingdom |access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies.\n\nIn some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members. A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France, the [[Francophonie]]; the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the [[Dutch Language Union]] is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands.\n\nMigration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies. Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] countries of north Africa and the majority population of France. Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of \"inner Paris\" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 45038321|title = Cultural Conflicts: North African Immigrants in France|journal = International Journal of Peace Studies|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 67\u201375|last1 = Seljuq|first1 = Affan|year = 1997|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol2_2/seljuq.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Introduced diseases===\n{{See also|Globalisation and disease|Columbian Exchange|Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonization}}\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\n\nEncounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.<ref>Kenneth F.

From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol. The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies.\n\nThe empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by [[Alexander the Great]], spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies. While most Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others (the word [[barbarian]] is derived from mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like \"bar-bar\"), Alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] of the Persians. He [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html adopted Persian customs of clothing] and otherwise encouraged his men to [[wikt:go native|go native]] by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms. Of note is that he radically departed from earlier Greek attempts at colonisation, characterised by the [[History of the Peloponnesian War|murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants]] and the settling of Greek citizens from the polis.\n\nRoman universalism was characterised by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law. [[Roman law]] was imposed on both Roman citizens and colonial subjects. Although Imperial Rome had [[Education in ancient Rome|no public education]], [[Latin]] spread through its use in government and trade. Roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves, which was responsible for the 200 year long [[Pax Romana]], at the time the longest period of peace in history. The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, even allowing them on a few occasions to [[Hyrcanus II|threaten Roman authority]].\n\n===Colonialism and geography===\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-99-01.jpg|thumb|[[British Togoland]] in 1953]]\n\nSettlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony, thus bridging the geographical, ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised.

The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate. Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the centre of the map. As [[J.B.

Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available&nbsp;... When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of [[underdevelopment]]&nbsp;... During the centuries of pre-colonial trade, some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism. Colonialism went much further than trade. It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa. Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society. Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards&nbsp;... Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called 'mother country'. From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources. It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped.\n\n:\"Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector. As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwSSkemSJLcC&pg=PA224 |title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa |last=Walter Rodney |publisher=East African Publishers |isbn=978-9966-25-113-8 |pages=149, 224|year=1972 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyiZafDHpqoC&pg=PA271 |title=A Companion To Postcolonial Studies |last=Henry Schwarz |last2=Sangeeta Ray |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-470-99833-5 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from [[free trade]] to a stage of [[monopoly]] [[capitalism]] to finance [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. He states it is, \"connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world\". As [[free trade]] thrives on [[exports]] of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry. This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism. He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing. War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism. As a continuation of this thought G.N. Uzoigwe states, \"But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses.\"<ref>Boahen, A. Adu.

In this sense, one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of [[postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said|Edward Sa\u00efd]]'s book  [[Orientalism (book)|''Orientalism'']] (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] (1913\u20132008) and [[Frantz Fanon]] (1925\u20131961) made similar claims decades before Sa\u00efd).\n\nSa\u00efd analyzed the works of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]], arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to [[Subaltern Studies]].\n\nIn ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak argued that major works of European [[metaphysics]] (such as those of  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers  [[Western culture|Western civilisation]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also had some traces of  [[Racism|racialism]] in his work.\n\n=== Colonistics ===\nThe field of '''colonistics''' studies colonialism from such viewpoints as those of economics, sociology and psychology.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZCAAAAAQBAJ |title=The Sociology of the Colonies [Part 1]: An Introduction to the Study of Race Contact |last=Maunier |first=Ren\u00e9 |publisher=Routledge |year=1949 |isbn=978-1-136-24522-0 |series=International Library of Sociology |publication-date=2013 |page=137 |translator-last=Lorimer |translator-first=E.-O. |quote=There are thus three elements in Colonistics or colonial study: Colonial ''Economics'', Colonial ''Sociology'' and Colonial ''Psychology''. |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects of Colonialism on the Colonisers ===\n[[File:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and the Prime Minister of United Kingdom (UK), Mr. David Cameron interacting with the school children, at Wembley Stadium, in London on November 13, 2015.jpg|thumb|Since 1945, [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] to the United Kingdom under [[British nationality law]] has been significant, in particular from the former [[British Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qj8GEjW91oEC |title=Citizenship and Immigration in Postwar Britain |last=Randall Hansen |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780191583018}}</ref>]]\nIn his 1955 essay, ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Discours sur le colonialisme''), French poet [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] evaluates the effects of racist, sexist, and capitalist attitudes and motivations on the civilisations that attempted to colonise other civilisations. In explaining his position, he says \"I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilisations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever its own particular genius may be, a civilisation that withdraws into itself atrophies; that for civilisations, exchange is oxygen.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=Discourse on colonialism |first=Aim\u00e9 |last=C\u00e9saire <!-- |date=1972 --> |publisher=Monthly Review Press |year=1955 |location=New York and London |pages=2 |oclc=849914517}}</ref> However, he contends that colonisation is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighbouring civilisations.\n\nTo illustrate his point, he explains that colonisation relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanise the targets of colonisation and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment. Every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonisers onto the colonised is justified by racist, sexist, otherwise xenophobic, or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people, the colonising civilisation \"acquires another dead weight, a universal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a centre of infection begins to spread.\" <ref name=\":2\" /> C\u00e9saire argues the result of this process is that \"a poison [is] instilled into the veins of Europe and, slowly but surely, the continent proceeds toward ''savagery''.\" <ref>{{Cite book |title=Discourse on colonialism. |first=Aim\u00e9 |last=C\u00e9saire <!-- |date=1972 --> |publisher=Monthly Review Press |year=1955 |location=New York and London |pages=3 |oclc=849914517}}</ref>  C\u00e9saire is indicating that the racist and xenophobic justifications for colonisation\u2014motivated by capitalist desires\u2014ultimately result in the moral and cultural degradation of the colonising nation. Thusly, colonisation is damaging to the civilisations that participate as perpetrators in a way that is internally harmful.\n\n==British public opinion about the British Empire==\nThe 2014 [[YouGov]] survey found that British people are mostly proud of colonialism and the [[British Empire]]:<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/colonial-nostalgia-horrors-of-empire-britain-olympic |title=Colonial nostalgia is back in fashion, blinding us to the horrors of empire |date=24 August 2016 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A new YouGov survey finds that most think the British Empire is more something to be proud of (59%) rather than ashamed of (19%). 23% don't know.

Some intended to remain in the colonies as temporary settlers, mainly as military personnel or on business. Others went to the colonies as immigrants. British people were by far the most numerous population to migrate to the colonies: 2.5 million settled in Canada; 1.5 million in Australia; 750,000 in New Zealand; 450,000 in the Union of South Africa; and 200,000 in India. French citizens also migrated in large numbers, mainly to the colonies in the north African [[Maghreb]] region: 1.3 million settled in Algeria; 200,000 in Morocco; 100,000 in Tunisia; while only 20,000 migrated to French Indochina. Dutch and German colonies saw relatively scarce European migration, since Dutch and German colonial expansion focused on commercial goals rather than settlement. Portugal sent 150,000 settlers to Angola, 80,000 to Mozambique, and 20,000 to Goa. During the Spanish Empire, approximately 550,000 Spanish settlers migrated to [[Latin America]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/34 |title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration |last=King |first=Russell |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26151-8 |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peopleonmoveatla0000unse/page/34 34\u201335]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes|gap=2em}}\n* [[African independence movements]]\n* [[Age of Discovery]]\n* [[American imperialism|American Empire]]\n* [[Anti-imperialism]]\n* [[Chartered companies]]\n* [[Chinese imperialism]]\n* [[Christianity and colonialism]]\n* [[Civilising mission]]\n* [[Colonial Empire]]\n* [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games]]\n* [[Coloniality of power]]\n* [[Colonial wars]]\n* [[Colonies in antiquity]]\n* [[Colonisation]]\n* [[Colony]]\n* [[Decoloniality]]\n* [[Decolonisation]]\n* [[Direct colonial rule]]\n* [[Empire of Liberty]]\n* [[European colonial empires]]\n* [[European colonization of Africa]]\n* [[European colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[European colonization of Micronesia]]\n* [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia]]\n* [[French law on colonialism]]\n* [[German eastward expansion]]\n* [[Global Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation]]\n* [[Imperialism]]\n* [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)]]\n* [[Muslim conquests]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n* [[Pluricontinental]]\n* [[Postcolonialism]]\n* [[Protectorate]]\n* [[Settler colonialism]]\n* [[Soviet Empire|Soviet Empire]]\n* [[Special Committee on Decolonisation]]\n* [[Stranger King (Concept)]]\n* [[Western imperialism in Asia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Albertini, Rudolf von.

A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for more recent editions is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. Recent editions also allow for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result.

Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].\n\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on ''[[Stranger Things]]'', was released in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/stranger-things-dd-roleplaying-game-starter-set|title=Stranger Things D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set {{!}} Dungeons & Dragons|website=dnd.wizards.com|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18511302/stranger-things-dungeons-and-dragons-starter-set-review|title=Stranger Things D&D Starter Set is a surprisingly good introduction to the game|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2019-04-22|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> A campaign based on the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons'']] comic book series was later released in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-and-morty-rpg-is-stupid-ir-1839783831|title=Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty RPG Is Stupid, Irreverent Fun...Especially for DMs|website=io9|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-morty-adventure/|title=We Played a D&D VS RICK AND MORTY Adventure|website=Nerdist|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.\n\n===Miniature figures===\n{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}\n[[File:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures. The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theater]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,<ref>\"This is not ''AD&D'' 3rd edition\" Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').</ref> and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional rulebooks.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe release of ''AD&D 2nd Edition'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&nbsp;\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs&nbsp;\u2013 were removed.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\">Ward; \"The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)\" in ''Dragon'' #154</ref> The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.<ref>Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/> A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy.

A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for more recent editions is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. Recent editions also allow for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 41</ref>\n\n===Adventures and campaigns===\n{{Main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings}}\n\nA typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 43</ref> The DM can either design an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].\n\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on ''[[Stranger Things]]'', was released in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/stranger-things-dd-roleplaying-game-starter-set|title=Stranger Things D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set {{!}} Dungeons & Dragons|website=dnd.wizards.com|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18511302/stranger-things-dungeons-and-dragons-starter-set-review|title=Stranger Things D&D Starter Set is a surprisingly good introduction to the game|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2019-04-22|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> A campaign based on the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons'']] comic book series was later released in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-and-morty-rpg-is-stupid-ir-1839783831|title=Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty RPG Is Stupid, Irreverent Fun...Especially for DMs|website=io9|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-morty-adventure/|title=We Played a D&D VS RICK AND MORTY Adventure|website=Nerdist|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.\n\n===Miniature figures===\n{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}\n[[File:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures. The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theater]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,<ref>\"This is not ''AD&D'' 3rd edition\" Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').</ref> and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional rulebooks.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe release of ''AD&D 2nd Edition'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&nbsp;\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs&nbsp;\u2013 were removed.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\">Ward; \"The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)\" in ''Dragon'' #154</ref> The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.<ref>Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/> A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy.

parliamentary and regional elections.\n\nVoters went to the polls to elect:\n* A [[President of Chile|President of the Republic]] to serve a four-year term.\n* Twenty three of 43 members of the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] to serve an eight-year term in the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]].\n* The full 155 members of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] to serve a four-year term in the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]].\n* The full 278 members of the regional boards to serve a four-year term.\n\nIn the presidential election, opposition candidate and former president [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]] took a lower than expected 36% of the vote\u2014though nearly 14 points ahead of his closest contender, senator [[Alejandro Guillier]], backed by the sitting administration. In the [[runoff election]], held on December 17, 2017, Pi\u00f1era beat the lawmaker with a surprising 54% of the vote, with turnout two points higher than in the first round.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections, the [[Chile Vamos]] coalition (supporter of Pi\u00f1era's candidacy) won 46% of the Chamber of Deputies and 44% of the Senate, while the governing [[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]] alliance, competing without the Christian Democrats for the first time in 28 years, lost its majority in both chambers, taking just 28% and 35% in the lower and upper chambers, respectively. The fledgling leftist bloc [[Broad Front (Chile)|Broad Front]] won 20 deputies (13%) and gained one senator. The Christian Democratic Party took 9% of the lower chamber and secured 14% of the Senate.\n\nFollowing an election reform in 2015, the Chamber of Deputies grew in size to 155 members from the previous 120, while the Senate increased its membership from 38 to 43 after this election, and will grow to 50 following the election in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/sistema-electoral-pasa-prueba-fuego/|title=El sistema electoral pasa su prueba de fuego|publisher=La Tercera}}</ref> Multi-seat constituencies were reestablished, replacing the previous [[Binomial voting|binomial system]] of two-seat per district, installed by the outgoing Pinochet dictatorship in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30177/ |title=Ley 18.799 |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379498000018 Electoral engineering in Chile: the electoral system and limited democracy]</ref> Also, for the first time, a 40% gender quota was put in place for candidates of each political party in parliamentary elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comunidadmujer.cl/2015/04/hoy-se-promulgo-reforma-al-sistema-electoral-que-incluye-cuotas-de-genero/|title=Hoy se promulg\u00f3 reforma al Sistema Electoral que incluye cuotas de g\u00e9nero \u2013 ComunidadMujer|date=April 27, 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAll the newly elected authorities began their terms on March 11, 2018.\n\nThis was the first non-primary election in which Chileans voted from abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/fichas/ver/47157|title=Voto de chilenos en el exterior \u2013 ChileAtiende en el Exterior \u2013 Tr\u00e1mites para chilenos en el extranjero|last=ChileAtiende|website=www.chileatiende.gob.cl}}</ref>\n\n==Presidential primaries==\n{{main|Chilean presidential primaries, 2017}}\n\nAccording to the Constitution, primaries are voluntary, but its results are binding.<ref name=\"constitution\">[http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=242302 Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile].

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Dee has a different mindset; she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\", whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. Mama believes the quilt should be used. Even if the quilts \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Dee has a different mindset; she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\", whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.

All current emeritus General Authorities are former members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventies or of the Presiding Bishopric.\n\nWhen the first General Authorities were given emeritus status, [[N. Eldon Tanner]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] provided the following explanation:\n\n<blockquote>\"The very rapid growth of the Church across the world, with the attendant increase in travel and responsibility, has made it necessary to consider a change in the status for some of the Brethren of the General Authorities. Some of our associates have served for many years with complete and unselfish dedication, and they deserve every honor and recognition for such devoted service. It is felt advisable at this time to reduce somewhat the load of responsibility that they carry.<br />\n\"After a long period of prayerful consideration and counsel, extending, indeed, over several years, we announce a new and specific status to be given from time to time to Brethren of our associates in the General Authorities. We announce that some Brethren have been designated as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. These Brethren are not being released but will be excused from active service. It is out of consideration for the personal well-being of the individuals, and with deep appreciation for their devoted service, that this designation will be given from time to time to designated members of the General Authorities.\" <ref>N.

They remain General Authorities until their deaths. All current emeritus General Authorities are former members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventies or of the Presiding Bishopric.\n\nWhen the first General Authorities were given emeritus status, [[N. Eldon Tanner]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] provided the following explanation:\n\n<blockquote>\"The very rapid growth of the Church across the world, with the attendant increase in travel and responsibility, has made it necessary to consider a change in the status for some of the Brethren of the General Authorities. Some of our associates have served for many years with complete and unselfish dedication, and they deserve every honor and recognition for such devoted service. It is felt advisable at this time to reduce somewhat the load of responsibility that they carry.<br />\n\"After a long period of prayerful consideration and counsel, extending, indeed, over several years, we announce a new and specific status to be given from time to time to Brethren of our associates in the General Authorities. We announce that some Brethren have been designated as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. These Brethren are not being released but will be excused from active service. It is out of consideration for the personal well-being of the individuals, and with deep appreciation for their devoted service, that this designation will be given from time to time to designated members of the General Authorities.\" <ref>N.
