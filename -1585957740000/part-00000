At the age of 32, he received the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Skippy (film)|Skippy]]'' (1931). He is the second youngest person ever to win the award after [[Damien Chazelle]], who won for ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' in 2017. He was later nominated for Best Director for the film ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'' (1938). He directed some of the best-known actors of the twentieth century, including his nephew [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Elvis Presley]]. Taurog directed six [[Martin and Lewis]] films, and nine Elvis Presley films, more than any other director. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Norman Taurog has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1600 Vine Street.\n\n==Early life==\nNorman Taurog was born February 23, 1899, in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents Arthur Jack Taurog and Anita (originally \"Annie\") Taurog (n\u00e9e Goldsmith).  His father's naturalization records claim that Arthur was born in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1872 or 1873 and naturalized as a minor, while his mother was from New York. Later census records claimed that Arthur's parents were from Germany, and Anita's were from England. The couple were married in Chicago in 1896.\n\nNorman became a child performer on the stage at an early age, making his movie debut at the age of 13 in the [[short film]] ''Tangled Relations'', produced by [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]]'s studios. In the eight years until his next screen credit, he worked in theater, mostly [[off-Broadway]].\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:MGM camera crew at K-25.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Norman Taurog (foreground, second from left) and MGM camera crew at [[K-25]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], in July 1946, filming ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1947)]]\nIn 1919, Taurog returned to the film industry as a director, collaborating with [[Larry Semon]] in ''The Sportsman'' (1920). In the coming decade, he made 42 silent films, mostly shorts. During this time, he developed his style, his forte being light comedy although he could also deal with drama and maintain complex narratives. In early 1928, he directed his first feature length film, ''The Ghetto'' starring [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], which was expanded in late 1928 with musical and dialogue portions directed by [[Charles C. Wilson (actor)|Charles C. Wilson]] for eventual release as ''[[Lucky Boy]]'' (1929).\n\nIn 1931, he made his breakthrough, directing ''[[Skippy (film)|Skippy]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Recently, Taurog's award statue sold for $301,973 at auction in Beverly Hills.  Taurog's nephew [[Jackie Cooper]] was also nominated for his performance; in his 1981 autobiography ''Please Don't Shoot My Dog'', Cooper wrote that, during filming, Taurog threatened to shoot his dog if the child actor could not cry for the scene. (While this book was being written, attempts were made by Cooper's editor to get Taurog's version of events; Taurog declined to participate.) ''Skippy'' tells of the adventures of the eponymous hero, his antics and adventures with his friend Sooky as they try to come up with a license for Sooky's dog, save his shantytown from demolition, sell lemonade and save for a new bike.  Based on a popular comic strip character, its sentiment, comedy and moral didacticism (common with movies of the time), added to a gritty realism made it a huge success, so much so that the studio immediately scheduled a sequel, ''Sooky'', for the following year.\n\nThe next few years saw Taurog enter the third chapter of his career, as an established director who could work in a number of genres. He directed a series of well-received films, including ''[[If I Had a Million]]'' (1932), which showed his ability to work with an all-star cast\u2014[[Gary Cooper]], [[George Raft]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[W. C. Fields]]. In 1934, he directed ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'', starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Ray Milland]]. In 1935, he directed the star-studded musical showcase ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1936]]'' starring Bing Crosby and George Burns and Gracie Allen.\n\nIn 1938, Taurog brought all his skill and experience to bear with one of the liveliest and most successful adaptations of classic literature; ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' was an artistic and commercial triumph.  The year also brought ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'', showing Taurog to be more than capable of sustaining a dramatic narrative and earning him another Academy Award nomination.  It wasn't all success, though. ''[[Lucky Night]]'' (1939) starring [[Myrna Loy]] and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] was a turkey, and while Taurog shot test scenes for 1939's cinematic extravaganza ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', [[Victor Fleming]] was chosen to direct. Taurog was reassigned to work on ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, ''a change which he had little to no say in. However, Taurog went on to earn a Best Director nomination for ''Boys Town'' later that year, despite losing out on directing ''Oz''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbagalleries.com/content/2013/08/06/unpublished-wizard-of-oz-photos-from-the-estate-of-norman-taurog/|title=Unpublished Wizard of Oz Photos from the Estate of Norman Taurog - PBA Galleries|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref> He did, however, helm the last of MGM's big pre-war musical showcases, 1940's ''[[Broadway Melody]]'', starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Eleanor Powell]].  He expanded his range into biographies, working with [[Mickey Rooney]] again, in the well-received ''[[Young Tom Edison]]'' (1940).  He directed [[Judy Garland]] twice, in ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'' (1940) and the 'small-town-girl-gets-big-break' ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'' (1943).<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\nAfter directing re-takes for a wartime propaganda film, ''[[Rationing (1944 film)|Rationing]]'' (1944), Taurog entered new territory with a docudrama of the atom bomb, ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1947). It was back to his metier of light comedy for his next couple of outings, ''[[The Bride Goes Wild]]'' with [[Van Johnson]] and [[June Allyson]], and ''Big City'', both in 1948. Remarkably, he also directed a third film that year combining the genres of comedy, drama and biography and dealing with an all-star cast; ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' was a fictionalized biopic of the relationship between [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]].  It starred, among others, Judy Garland, [[Gene Kelly]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Cyd Charisse]]. By now, Taurog had established a reputation as a director who was comfortable working in the musical and comedy genre, and who could be relied upon to work with slight material\u2014qualities which would be useful later in his career.\n\n[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] had been a double-act since 1946 and had made five films together, three Martin and Lewis top-liners, before Taurog directed ''[[Jumping Jacks]]'' (1952), regarded by many Martin and Lewis fans as the finest of their films. Taurog worked well with the duo and he went on to direct them in ''[[The Stooge]]'' (1953), ''[[The Caddy]]'' (1954), ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1955), ''[[You're Never Too Young]]'' (1954), and their penultimate film together, ''[[Pardners]]'' (1956). Taurog worked with Lewis alone twice more, in ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship (film)|Don't Give Up the Ship]]'' (1959) and ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'' (1960).\n\nIn 1960, Taurog directed his first [[Elvis Presley]] film, ''[[G.I. Blues]]''. This was a turning point for Elvis. Up until then, he had harbored ambitions of being a [[James Dean]] figure, playing brooding rebel roles in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956), ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), and ''[[King Creole]]'' (1958). However, [[Colonel Tom Parker]] had different plans for the singer. ''G.I. Blues'' was Elvis's first film in two years, following his return from the army, and would set the tone for future films\u2014a few girls, a few adventures, and a few songs along the way with weak plots and uninspired acting. When well-made, this was an entertaining, light-hearted formula and Taurog, now in his sixties, was an old hand at it. So impressed was Parker with his work that over the next eight years, Taurog directed Elvis in eight more films: ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'' (1962), ''[[It Happened at the World's Fair]]'' (1963), ''[[Tickle Me]]'' (1965), ''[[Spinout (film)|Spinout]]'' (1966), ''[[Double Trouble (1967 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1967), ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968), and ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]'' (1968).  Although some were better than others\u2014and some were almost identical\u2014Taurog ensured that the films had pace, the comedy was delivered well, and the songs were well executed. ''Live a Little, Love a Little'' was his last film.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1968, Taurog retired from directing. He later taught at the [[University of Southern California]] School of Cinema and remained a board member of the Director's Guild. He owned a camera shop in Canoga Park. Toward the end of his life he became blind. In his last years, he served as director of the [[Braille Institute of America|Braille Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Taurog died on April 7, 1981 in [[Palm Desert, California]], at the age of 82.<ref name=\"nytimes-obit\">{{cite news|title=Norman Taurog, Director, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 10, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/obituaries/norman-taurog-director-dies-winner-of-an-oscar-for-skippy.html |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> His ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]].

At the age of 32, he received the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Skippy (film)|Skippy]]'' (1931). He is the second youngest person ever to win the award after [[Damien Chazelle]], who won for ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' in 2017. He was later nominated for Best Director for the film ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'' (1938). He directed some of the best-known actors of the twentieth century, including his nephew [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Elvis Presley]]. Taurog directed six [[Martin and Lewis]] films, and nine Elvis Presley films, more than any other director. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Norman Taurog has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1600 Vine Street.\n\n==Early life==\nNorman Taurog was born February 23, 1899, in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents Arthur Jack Taurog and Anita (originally \"Annie\") Taurog (n\u00e9e Goldsmith).  His father's naturalization records claim that Arthur was born in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1872 or 1873 and naturalized as a minor, while his mother was from New York. Later census records claimed that Arthur's parents were from Germany, and Anita's were from England. The couple were married in Chicago in 1896.\n\nNorman became a child performer on the stage at an early age, making his movie debut at the age of 13 in the [[short film]] ''Tangled Relations'', produced by [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]]'s studios. In the eight years until his next screen credit, he worked in theater, mostly [[off-Broadway]].\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:MGM camera crew at K-25.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Norman Taurog (foreground, second from left) and MGM camera crew at [[K-25]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], in July 1946, filming ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1947)]]\nIn 1919, Taurog returned to the film industry as a director, collaborating with [[Larry Semon]] in ''The Sportsman'' (1920). In the coming decade, he made 42 silent films, mostly shorts. During this time, he developed his style, his forte being light comedy although he could also deal with drama and maintain complex narratives. In early 1928, he directed his first feature length film, ''The Ghetto'' starring [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], which was expanded in late 1928 with musical and dialogue portions directed by [[Charles C. Wilson]] for eventual release as ''[[Lucky Boy]]'' (1929).\n\nIn 1931, he made his breakthrough, directing ''[[Skippy (film)|Skippy]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Recently, Taurog's award statue sold for $301,973 at auction in Beverly Hills.  Taurog's nephew [[Jackie Cooper]] was also nominated for his performance; in his 1981 autobiography ''Please Don't Shoot My Dog'', Cooper wrote that, during filming, Taurog threatened to shoot his dog if the child actor could not cry for the scene. (While this book was being written, attempts were made by Cooper's editor to get Taurog's version of events; Taurog declined to participate.) ''Skippy'' tells of the adventures of the eponymous hero, his antics and adventures with his friend Sooky as they try to come up with a license for Sooky's dog, save his shantytown from demolition, sell lemonade and save for a new bike.  Based on a popular comic strip character, its sentiment, comedy and moral didacticism (common with movies of the time), added to a gritty realism made it a huge success, so much so that the studio immediately scheduled a sequel, ''Sooky'', for the following year.\n\nThe next few years saw Taurog enter the third chapter of his career, as an established director who could work in a number of genres. He directed a series of well-received films, including ''[[If I Had a Million]]'' (1932), which showed his ability to work with an all-star cast\u2014[[Gary Cooper]], [[George Raft]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[W. C. Fields]]. In 1934, he directed ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'', starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Ray Milland]]. In 1935, he directed the star-studded musical showcase ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1936]]'' starring Bing Crosby and George Burns and Gracie Allen.\n\nIn 1938, Taurog brought all his skill and experience to bear with one of the liveliest and most successful adaptations of classic literature; ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' was an artistic and commercial triumph.  The year also brought ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'', showing Taurog to be more than capable of sustaining a dramatic narrative and earning him another Academy Award nomination.  It wasn't all success, though. ''[[Lucky Night]]'' (1939) starring [[Myrna Loy]] and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] was a turkey, and while Taurog shot test scenes for 1939's cinematic extravaganza ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', [[Victor Fleming]] was chosen to direct. Taurog was reassigned to work on ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, ''a change which he had little to no say in. However, Taurog went on to earn a Best Director nomination for ''Boys Town'' later that year, despite losing out on directing ''Oz''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbagalleries.com/content/2013/08/06/unpublished-wizard-of-oz-photos-from-the-estate-of-norman-taurog/|title=Unpublished Wizard of Oz Photos from the Estate of Norman Taurog - PBA Galleries|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref> He did, however, helm the last of MGM's big pre-war musical showcases, 1940's ''[[Broadway Melody]]'', starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Eleanor Powell]].  He expanded his range into biographies, working with [[Mickey Rooney]] again, in the well-received ''[[Young Tom Edison]]'' (1940).  He directed [[Judy Garland]] twice, in ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'' (1940) and the 'small-town-girl-gets-big-break' ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'' (1943).<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\nAfter directing re-takes for a wartime propaganda film, ''[[Rationing (1944 film)|Rationing]]'' (1944), Taurog entered new territory with a docudrama of the atom bomb, ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1947). It was back to his metier of light comedy for his next couple of outings, ''[[The Bride Goes Wild]]'' with [[Van Johnson]] and [[June Allyson]], and ''Big City'', both in 1948. Remarkably, he also directed a third film that year combining the genres of comedy, drama and biography and dealing with an all-star cast; ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' was a fictionalized biopic of the relationship between [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]].  It starred, among others, Judy Garland, [[Gene Kelly]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Cyd Charisse]]. By now, Taurog had established a reputation as a director who was comfortable working in the musical and comedy genre, and who could be relied upon to work with slight material\u2014qualities which would be useful later in his career.\n\n[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] had been a double-act since 1946 and had made five films together, three Martin and Lewis top-liners, before Taurog directed ''[[Jumping Jacks]]'' (1952), regarded by many Martin and Lewis fans as the finest of their films. Taurog worked well with the duo and he went on to direct them in ''[[The Stooge]]'' (1953), ''[[The Caddy]]'' (1954), ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1955), ''[[You're Never Too Young]]'' (1954), and their penultimate film together, ''[[Pardners]]'' (1956). Taurog worked with Lewis alone twice more, in ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship (film)|Don't Give Up the Ship]]'' (1959) and ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'' (1960).\n\nIn 1960, Taurog directed his first [[Elvis Presley]] film, ''[[G.I. Blues]]''. This was a turning point for Elvis. Up until then, he had harbored ambitions of being a [[James Dean]] figure, playing brooding rebel roles in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956), ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), and ''[[King Creole]]'' (1958). However, [[Colonel Tom Parker]] had different plans for the singer. ''G.I. Blues'' was Elvis's first film in two years, following his return from the army, and would set the tone for future films\u2014a few girls, a few adventures, and a few songs along the way with weak plots and uninspired acting. When well-made, this was an entertaining, light-hearted formula and Taurog, now in his sixties, was an old hand at it. So impressed was Parker with his work that over the next eight years, Taurog directed Elvis in eight more films: ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'' (1962), ''[[It Happened at the World's Fair]]'' (1963), ''[[Tickle Me]]'' (1965), ''[[Spinout (film)|Spinout]]'' (1966), ''[[Double Trouble (1967 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1967), ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968), and ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]'' (1968).  Although some were better than others\u2014and some were almost identical\u2014Taurog ensured that the films had pace, the comedy was delivered well, and the songs were well executed. ''Live a Little, Love a Little'' was his last film.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1968, Taurog retired from directing. He later taught at the [[University of Southern California]] School of Cinema and remained a board member of the Director's Guild. He owned a camera shop in Canoga Park. Toward the end of his life he became blind. In his last years, he served as director of the [[Braille Institute of America|Braille Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Taurog died on April 7, 1981 in [[Palm Desert, California]], at the age of 82.<ref name=\"nytimes-obit\">{{cite news|title=Norman Taurog, Director, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 10, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/obituaries/norman-taurog-director-dies-winner-of-an-oscar-for-skippy.html |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> His ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.\n\nU.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain.

Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.\n\n===Expiration of copyright===\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that \"pre-1925 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities|formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements\u2014a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.<ref>[[Dennis Karjala]], \"Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation\", 35 N.

For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States\u2014a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase \"a\", is not.

The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.\n\nU.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain.

Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.\n\n===Expiration of copyright===\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that \"pre-1925 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities|formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements\u2014a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.<ref>[[Dennis Karjala]], \"Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation\", 35 N. Ky. L.

Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (\"[[Permission culture]]\"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as a public domain like [[software license]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130602181949/http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org</ref> In 2009 the [[Creative Commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''.

For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States\u2014a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase \"a\", is not.
