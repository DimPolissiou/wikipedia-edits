Not only did the Lyon & Healy company often change designs to follow the rapidly evolving consumer demand, but the company also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services, including decorating instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various [[store brand|house brands]], and [[Outsourcing|outsourced construction]] of some models.\n\nIn 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | author    = John Teagle | first = U.S. Music Corp.\n | year      = 1996\n | title     = Washburn, Over One Hundred Years of Fine Stringed Instruments\n | edition   = 1st\n | publisher = Amsco Publications | location = New York\n | isbn      = 0-8256-1435-X\n | page      = 73\n}}\n</ref> It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day [[Steel-string acoustic guitar#Types|dreadnought and jumbo]] acoustic guitars.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |width=135\n | image1   = Washburn Shrine banjos at the American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption1 = Washburn ''Shrine'' banjos at the [[American Banjo Museum]]\n | image2   = Washburn Presentation Banjo (Lyon & Healy) 1894, American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption2 = Washburn ''Presentation Banjo'', 1894, American Banjo Museum.\n}}\nGeorge Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|title=The history of the American guitar: 1833 to the present day|date=1 September 2001|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9781617130335|edition=1st}}</ref> Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905.\n\nBy the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly [[movie theater|film]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction#Disc phonograph|the gramophone]]. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs.\n\nTonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the [[Regal Musical Instrument Company]], which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing.\n\n===Modern era===\nAn unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website:\n{{quote|''Washburn has been building stringed instruments since 1883. \u2026 130 years of history is at the root of our strong foundation building high quality instruments.<ref>''http://www.washburn.com/community/'' \"The History of Washburn Guitars\"</ref>''}}\nThere is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International.\n\nIn the early 1960s, retail store '''The Chicago Guitar Gallery''' hired '''Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher''', a young German [[Luthier|violin builder]], as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened '''The Sound Post'''<ref>''[https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/rudy-schlacher]'', heading of \"Rudy Schlacher\" video in [[NAMM]] Oral History video project.</ref><ref>''[http://grandpianohaus.com/about/mission \"Grand Piano Haus: The history of Grand Piano Haus\"]''</ref> (in Evanston, Illinois) to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for lower-cost quality instruments.\n\nTom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos.\n\nSchlacher and Rick Johnstone, as '''Fretted Industries, Inc.''', acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,<ref>''[https://www.beckmenvineyards.com/our-story]:Beckmen Music became [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s distributor for the western United States in 1976, and in 1978 a 50% partner in founding '''Roland USA'''. The Beckmens sold their share back to Roland in 1993 and bought a vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley.</ref> and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] (founder of [[Roland Corporation]]), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Di Perna|first1=Alan|title=Burning for you|url=https://www.infomusic.pl/images/PDF/WASHBURN_GW7-09.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=Guitar World|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as [[Oscar Schmidt Inc.|Oscar Schmidt]] [[autoharp]]s.\n\nSchlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to '''Washburn International'''. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article<ref>''[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-17/business/9101150609_1_guitars-acoustic-stringed \"Guitar-maker Strikes Comeback Chord: Washburn Hits The Top 3 On 15 Years Of Growth\"], February 17, 1991''</ref> confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]].\n\nOn December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of [[U.S. Music Corporation]],<ref>''[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.US_Music_Corp.90f14f8af048ab4b.html] Hoovers.com, entry: U.S. MUSIC CORPORATION Company Profile''</ref> and would be rolling its assets into that company in a [[Reverse takeover|reverse merger]].<ref>''[http://www.usmusiccorp.com/pr/usm.htm  U.S. Music press release]'', 12/15/2002</ref> Schlacher remained as [[CFO]], appointing '''Gary Gryczan''' to [[Chief operating officer|COO]]; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn [[luthier]]y, often referred to as \"the USA Custom Shop.\" The USA Custom Shop was previously located at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave in the 1990s in an old factory that was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire, it was rumored to be haunted by the victims whose bodies had been stored there. \n\nSchlacher announced completion of selling USM to '''JAM Industries''' on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.<ref>''[http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2009/090813/090813_usmc2.html \"Schlacher Says Farewell\"]''</ref> {{quote|''We are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years.

It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand.\n\nThe first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600.\n\nUnder Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, a further run might be ordered. This application of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (or [[lean manufacturing]]) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, many Washburn instruments (acoustic or electric) are difficult to locate once out of production, and are scarcer than the \"limited editions\" of other manufacturers.\n\nThe first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978-1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and [[neck-through]] construction.  Most of the Wing Series models were produced by Yamaki, a Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars as well as their own Daion brand (late 1970s to early 1980s).\n\nBy 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by [[Samick]]. When Samick opened their [[Cileungsi]], Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 90\u2019s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 90\u2019s. The building was so old it was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire and rumored to have been haunted. At least two guitar heists occurred there when thieves backed a box truck through a wall and loaded the truck with guitars getting away cleanly. \n\nBetween 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by [[Tacoma Guitars]] (Tacoma, Washington) and five by [[Dana Bourgeois|Bourgeois Guitars]] (Lewiston, Maine).\n\nWashburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.)\n<!-- trivia: The J-14 (1998) and J-15 (1998-1999) archtops were among the highest-priced Washburn guitars ever made. -->\n\nIn 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth-largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.<ref>[http://www.ci.douglasville.ga.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/2073 Village of Mundelein 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report]</ref> The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive)<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170308141152/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-13D4019E304C9408.html]'', Guitar maker leaves Mundelein.</ref> but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati.\n\nAs of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China.\n\n==Innovations==\nMost widely known for its guitars (both [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]]), Washburn also makes [[electric bass]]es, [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic basses]], [[banjo]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Silent guitar|travel guitar]]s, [[ukulele]]s, and [[amplifier]]s, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, [[Electronic tuner|tuner]]s, and straps.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Washburn History<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/community/\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars / U.S. Music Corp., a division of JAM Industries, LTD.\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Washburn introduced the '''Festival Series''' of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to [[audio feedback|feedback]], a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation,  further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. In the early 1990s when [[MTV]] introduced their [[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]] series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged.\n\n[[File:Washburn RB2802 8-String Bass headstock with Buzz Feiten tuning system.jpg|thumb|right|[[Headstock]] of a Washburn RB2802 eight-string bass.]]\n\nIn recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features:\n* ''the [[Buzz Feiten]] Tuning System'' &mdash; a corrected-temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems of the Western tuning formula. The BFTS was first used by Washburn in 1995 on a very few models, then increasingly with the introduction of the WI-64 (1999), and was entirely phased out after the 2010 production year. At its peak, this system came standard on U.S.-made Washburn guitars and basses and the better imports.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Buzz Feiten Tuning System<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars\n | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111221035732/http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | archivedate = 2011-12-21\n}}</ref>\n* ''Stephen's Extended Cutaway'' &mdash; a unique [[bolt-on]] neck joint invented by luthier Stephen Davies to allow greater unrestricted access for a guitarist's fretting hand.

While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar.\n;suffix \u2014\n* C - cutaway\n* DL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features)\n* E - electric (i.e., built-in pickup)\n* K - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag)\n* LH - left-handed\n* M - mahogany top\n* Q - quilt maple top\n* R - rosewood\n* S - solid-wood top (rather than laminate)\n* SP - spalt maple top\n* SW - solid wood used throughout\n* V - vibrato (on electric guitars)\nThis often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story. For example, the WLG110SWCEK indicates that it's part of the Woodline series (WL-), likely top of the line (110), Grand Auditorium (G) size, all solid wood, cutaway, piezo pickup, and originally included a case.\n\n== Past and present models ==\nAny given series may have as few as only one model.\n\n=== Electric guitars ===\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=horizontal |width=150\n | image1   = Washburn WG587.jpg\n | caption1 = WG587 7-string guitar.\n | image2   = Washburn N4 Special 20 1.jpg\n | caption2 = N4 Special\n}}\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=horizontal\n | image1   = Washburn_hb35.jpg|width1=150\n | caption1 = HB35.\n | image2   = Washburn J5 Jazz Guitar.jpg|width2=150\n | caption2 = J5 Jazz guitar.\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! prefix\n!

As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various [[store brand|house brands]], and [[Outsourcing|outsourced construction]] of some models.\n\nIn 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | author    = John Teagle | first = U.S. Music Corp.\n | year      = 1996\n | title     = Washburn, Over One Hundred Years of Fine Stringed Instruments\n | edition   = 1st\n | publisher = Amsco Publications | location = New York\n | isbn      = 0-8256-1435-X\n | page      = 73\n}}\n</ref> It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day [[Steel-string acoustic guitar#Types|dreadnought and jumbo]] acoustic guitars.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |width=135\n | image1   = Washburn Shrine banjos at the American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption1 = Washburn ''Shrine'' banjos at the [[American Banjo Museum]]\n | image2   = Washburn Presentation Banjo (Lyon & Healy) 1894, American Banjo Museum.jpg\n | caption2 = Washburn ''Presentation Banjo'', 1894, American Banjo Museum.\n}}\nGeorge Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|title=The history of the American guitar: 1833 to the present day|date=1 September 2001|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9781617130335|edition=1st}}</ref> Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905.\n\nBy the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly [[movie theater|film]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction#Disc phonograph|the gramophone]]. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs.\n\nTonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the [[Regal Musical Instrument Company]], which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing.\n\n===Modern era===\nAn unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website:\n{{quote|''Washburn has been building stringed instruments since 1883. \u2026 130 years of history is at the root of our strong foundation building high quality instruments.<ref>''http://www.washburn.com/community/'' \"The History of Washburn Guitars\"</ref>''}}\nThere is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International.\n\nIn the early 1960s, retail store '''The Chicago Guitar Gallery''' hired '''Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher''', a young German [[Luthier|violin builder]], as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened '''The Sound Post'''<ref>''[https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/rudy-schlacher]'', heading of \"Rudy Schlacher\" video in [[NAMM]] Oral History video project.</ref><ref>''[http://grandpianohaus.com/about/mission \"Grand Piano Haus: The history of Grand Piano Haus\"]''</ref> (in Evanston, Illinois) to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for lower-cost quality instruments.\n\nTom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos.\n\nSchlacher and Rick Johnstone, as '''Fretted Industries, Inc.''', acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,<ref>''[https://www.beckmenvineyards.com/our-story]:Beckmen Music became [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s distributor for the western United States in 1976, and in 1978 a 50% partner in founding '''Roland USA'''. The Beckmens sold their share back to Roland in 1993 and bought a vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley.</ref> and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] (founder of [[Roland Corporation]]), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Di Perna|first1=Alan|title=Burning for you|url=https://www.infomusic.pl/images/PDF/WASHBURN_GW7-09.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=Guitar World|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as [[Oscar Schmidt Inc.|Oscar Schmidt]] [[autoharp]]s.\n\nSchlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to '''Washburn International'''. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article<ref>''[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-17/business/9101150609_1_guitars-acoustic-stringed \"Guitar-maker Strikes Comeback Chord: Washburn Hits The Top 3 On 15 Years Of Growth\"], February 17, 1991''</ref> confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]].\n\nOn December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of [[U.S. Music Corporation]],<ref>''[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.US_Music_Corp.90f14f8af048ab4b.html] Hoovers.com, entry: U.S. MUSIC CORPORATION Company Profile''</ref> and would be rolling its assets into that company in a [[Reverse takeover|reverse merger]].<ref>''[http://www.usmusiccorp.com/pr/usm.htm  U.S. Music press release]'', 12/15/2002</ref> Schlacher remained as [[CFO]], appointing '''Gary Gryczan''' to [[Chief operating officer|COO]]; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn [[luthier]]y, often referred to as \"the USA Custom Shop.\" The USA Custom Shop was previously located at elston ave. and Springfield Ave in the 1990\u2019s in an old factory that was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire, it was rumored to be haunted by the victims whose bodies had been stored there. \n\nSchlacher announced completion of selling USM to '''JAM Industries''' on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.<ref>''[http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2009/090813/090813_usmc2.html \"Schlacher Says Farewell\"]''</ref> {{quote|''We are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years.

It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand.\n\nThe first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600.\n\nUnder Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, a further run might be ordered. This application of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (or [[lean manufacturing]]) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, many Washburn instruments (acoustic or electric) are difficult to locate once out of production, and are scarcer than the \"limited editions\" of other manufacturers.\n\nThe first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978-1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and [[neck-through]] construction.  Most of the Wing Series models were produced by Yamaki, a Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars as well as their own Daion brand (late 1970s to early 1980s).\n\nBy 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by [[Samick]]. When Samick opened their [[Cileungsi]], Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 90\u2019s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 90\u2019s. The building was so old it was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire and rumored to have been haunted. At least two guitar heists occurred there when thieves backed a box truck through a wall and loaded the truck with guitars getting away cleanly. \n\nBetween 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by [[Tacoma Guitars]] (Tacoma, Washington) and five by [[Dana Bourgeois|Bourgeois Guitars]] (Lewiston, Maine).\n\nWashburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.)\n<!-- trivia: The J-14 (1998) and J-15 (1998-1999) archtops were among the highest-priced Washburn guitars ever made. -->\n\nIn 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth-largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.<ref>[http://www.ci.douglasville.ga.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/2073 Village of Mundelein 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report]</ref> The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive)<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170308141152/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-13D4019E304C9408.html]'', Guitar maker leaves Mundelein.</ref> but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati.\n\nAs of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China.\n\n==Innovations==\nMost widely known for its guitars (both [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]]), Washburn also makes [[electric bass]]es, [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic basses]], [[banjo]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Silent guitar|travel guitar]]s, [[ukulele]]s, and [[amplifier]]s, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, [[Electronic tuner|tuner]]s, and straps.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Washburn History<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/community/\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars / U.S. Music Corp., a division of JAM Industries, LTD.\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Washburn introduced the '''Festival Series''' of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to [[audio feedback|feedback]], a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation,  further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. In the early 1990s when [[MTV]] introduced their [[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]] series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged.\n\n[[File:Washburn RB2802 8-String Bass headstock with Buzz Feiten tuning system.jpg|thumb|right|[[Headstock]] of a Washburn RB2802 eight-string bass.]]\n\nIn recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features:\n* ''the [[Buzz Feiten]] Tuning System'' &mdash; a corrected-temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems of the Western tuning formula. The BFTS was first used by Washburn in 1995 on a very few models, then increasingly with the introduction of the WI-64 (1999), and was entirely phased out after the 2010 production year. At its peak, this system came standard on U.S.-made Washburn guitars and basses and the better imports.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = Buzz Feiten Tuning System<!-- Bot generated title -->\n | url       = http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | publisher = Washburn Guitars\n | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111221035732/http://www.washburn.com/resources/resources/buzz-feiten.html\n | archivedate = 2011-12-21\n}}</ref>\n* ''Stephen's Extended Cutaway'' &mdash; a unique [[bolt-on]] neck joint invented by luthier Stephen Davies to allow greater unrestricted access for a guitarist's fretting hand.

Additional letters may be used to indicate the instrument's finish. While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar.\n;suffix \u2014\n* C - cutaway\n* DL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features)\n* E - electric (i.e., built-in pickup)\n* K - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag)\n* LH - left-handed\n* M - mahogany top\n* Q - quilt maple top\n* R - rosewood\n* S - solid-wood top (rather than laminate)\n* SP - spalt maple top\n* SW - solid wood used throughout\n* V - vibrato (on electric guitars)\nThis often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story.

Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on [[sabermetrics]]\u2014in this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22378|title=Baseball Prospectus  \u2013 Baseball Therapy: What Happened to the Complete Game?|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>  While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \"quality innings,\" at which point the manager\u2014who, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count\u2014will normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballmagazine.net/2015/09/04/lost-art-of-the-complete-game/|title=Lost Art of the Complete Game|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> There are exceptions\u2014a manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had [[Tommy John surgery]] or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm.\n\nThese changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2.

[[George Sisler]]'s .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. [[Ted Williams]] hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only [[George Brett]], who hit .390 in 1980, and [[Tony Gwynn]], who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs.\n\nIn a 2018 ESPN story, the aforementioned Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play\u2014a group of skills which largely do not complement one another.<ref name=\"Miller 400\"/>\n\n=== Most RBI in a season \u2013 191 ===\nSet by [[Hack Wilson]], who batted in 191 runs in 1930.

He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of base-runners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\"<ref name=\"Miller 2019 unbreakable\"/>  However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \"three true outcomes\" \u2013 a home run, walk, or strikeout<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three_True_Outcomes Three True Outcomes, Baseball-reference.com]</ref> \u2013 there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.\n\n=== Highest career on-base percentage \u2013 .482 ===\n[[File:Ted Williams BBall Digest May 1949 raw.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Williams]] topped a .400 on-base percentage 18 times in his 19 years, often by 100 points or more, including .553 en route to a .406 batting average in 1941, the last season ever over .400.]]\n\nSet by [[Ted Williams]] from 1939 to 1960.<ref name=Williams>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.9.html |title=.482 lifetime on-base percentage \u2013 Ted Williams \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]], and two MVP awards.

Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]], which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games.\n\nBecause the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the [[World Series]].\n\nBoth the individual and team single-season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with [[one-game playoff]]s. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. The American League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nNo team has played more than 163 regular season games in a season since 1962. While there have been a few occasions where a three-way tie was possible going into the last day of the season (which would result in a team playing 164 games), a three-way tie involving postseason berths has never occurred. From 1969 to 1993, it would have been impossible for any team to be involved in more than three one-game playoffs in a season, since only division champions qualified for the postseason and since there was never more than eight teams per division. As of the end of the 2018 season, there has yet to be an occasion in MLB history where five teams of one league have finished with identical records, which would have been the circumstance needed during this era for any team to play even three tie-breakers and thus match the 1962 record.\n\nSince the introduction of the wild card, it has been technically possible to play 166 regular season games, but is extremely unlikely. For a team to have an opportunity to play four tiebreaker games, it would have to be involved in a tie involving three or more teams for the division crown ''and'' a separate tie also involving three or more teams for the second wild card berth, meaning that the aforementioned-unprecedented circumstance at least five teams in two different divisions of the same league finishing with identical records would have to occur. A team in such a situation would then have to win the division \"semi-final\" tiebreaker, lose the division \"final\" and then win the wild card \"semi-final\" in order to play 166 regular season games. The 2018 season, which resulted in two two-way ties for division titles, was the first occasion where there were even multiple two-way ties for division titles \u2013 the losers of the 2018 tiebreaker games (who did not themselves have identical records) subsequently played each other in the Wild Card Game, but that game is considered part of the postseason and not the regular season.\n\nWills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players, part of a new ''metric''-based strategy known as \"load management\". On average only about three players in all of baseball appear in all 162 games of any given MLB season. This implies that even if a club somehow managed to play 166 regular season games, there is mathematically only about a ten percent chance a particular team will have a player who will have appeared in all 162 games pending tie-breakers.\n\nIt is also possible for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season by virtue of a mid-season trade.  A swap between a team that has played more games and one which has played fewer can result in a schedule for the traded player to be greater than either individual teams'.

With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, almost all of which occurred while he played in the AL, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs,<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ferrewe01</ref> and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers. Other American League pitchers with notable home-run totals include [[Bob Lemon]], who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; [[Red Ruffing]], who smacked 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], who hit out 35 home runs in an 11-year career \u2013 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter \u2013 all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoea01</ref> With \"good-hitting pitchers\" the exception rather than the rule, the American League's adoption of the [[designated hitter]] rule in 1973 \u2013 leading to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's traditional #9 slot in the batting order in all AL games and all interleague, All-Star and World Series games played in AL parks \u2013 means that no American League pitcher will ever get enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics, or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically. However, the [[Los Angeles Angels]]' signing of Japanese player [[Shohei Ohtani]] \u2014 who notably plays as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter \u2014 could mean that Ferrell's record could be broken (although Ohtani generally does not hit and pitch in the same game when playing in AL parks, so his home runs as a DH may not be considered as being hit \"by a pitcher\").\n\n=== Most career sacrifice bunts \u2013 512 ===\nSet by [[Eddie Collins]], who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics. [[Joe Pasternak]] dubbed Collins as \"the smartest player in baseball history\". Not only was Collins a prolific bunter, but also 10th all-time in [[Wins Above Replacement|WAR]] and hit .333 for his career with 3,315 hits and 745 stolen bases.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisachit1.shtml</ref> Second behind him is [[Jake Daubert]] with 392, more than 100 fewer than Collins. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: ''[[Moneyball]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]], the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \"evil\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position. At the end of the 2019 season, the active leader in career sacrifice bunts, [[Clayton Kershaw]], had 108\u2014which placed him in a tie for 334th on the all-time list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SH_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders & Records for Sacrifice Hits |work=Baseball-Reference |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Most stolen bases in a season \u2013 130 ===\n[[File:Baseball steal.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rickey Henderson]] holds both the single season (130) and career stolen base records (1,406), both regarded as unlikely to be broken.]]\nSet by Henderson with 130 in 1982, Henderson was caught stealing 42 times.

They were so bad \u2013 20 wins below the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] \u2013 they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a season at the same time.\n\nWhat is unusual, however, about their road loss record compared to others on this list in that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot mathematically be broken even if a team achieved a completely [[winless season]] on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tourtellotte|first=Shane|title=The unbreakable records|date=September 18, 2013|work=The Hardball Times|url=https://tht.fangraphs.com/the-unbreakable-records/|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[rainout (sports)|rainouts]] and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, there is no way to accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record. The only situation in which regular season games are ever added to the schedule is in the case of the [[one-game playoff]]; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game are infinitesimally small. In the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the [[legal fiction]] that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose [[home advantage|rules advantages]]. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to road games.\n\nThree other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record:\n* In 1899, owners were allowed to own more than one team, and in the case of the Spiders, the owners also owned the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]]. Believing it more profitable to have a good team in St. Louis, the Spiders' best players from 1898 \u2013 including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitchers [[Cy Young]], [[Jesse Burkett]] and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]] \u2013 were given to the Perfectos in exchange for their least desirable players, with their manager, [[Patsy Tebeau]]. From 1900, MLB rules have prohibited a single owner owning more than one team to avoid any repeat of this, or any simliar, arrangements.\n* Baseball teams in 1899 had gate receipts as their main source for revenue. Since fans in Cleveland were not going to pay to watch a decimated roster, the Spiders/Perfectos ownership transferred all of the Spiders' home games against the Perfectos to St. Louis. As the season wore on and the crowds in Cleveland shrunk in response to mounting losses, the other 11 NL teams requested the Spiders transfer home games to their parks, as their cut of the gate receipts would leave them unable to recoup the expenses of the journey. Since the Spiders' cut of the gate receipts for road games was far more lucrative than their gate receipts for home games, the Spiders' owners were not inclined to object to such requests. Thus, the Spiders only played eight home games after July 1, giving them the opportunity for 101 road losses (against 11 wins). \n** Today, MLB revenue streams are far more numerous, while in the case of media rights are often both contractually dependent on teams playing their entire schedule, and are not affected by attendance, while travel expenses make up a much smaller portion of a team's budget. MLB rules also state any team that refuses to travel to their opponent's stadium for a scheduled game would immediately [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] the game.\n* The 1899 Spiders played their entire 154-game schedule \u2013 an unusual occurrence in an era when cancellations were much more frequent, and cancelled games were often not made up.\n\nThe 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40\u2013120, .250 winning percentage) and the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003 Detroit Tigers]] (43\u2013119, .265 winning percentage).\n\nSince 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of cancelled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).\n\n=== Lowest paying attendance \u2013 6 ===\nThis was set by the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester baseball club]] in 1882.<ref name=worcester>Eduardo A.

Most pitchers in today's game of five-man rotations start fewer than 35 games per season, and thus do not start enough games to break the record. The most games started by a pitcher in the 2019 season was 34, accomplished by seven pitchers, and only three pitchers in the 21st century have started more than 35 games in a season ([[Tom Glavine]] in 2002 and [[Roy Halladay]] and [[Greg Maddux]] in 2003, each with 36 starts).<ref>{{cite web|title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Games Started|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/GS_top_ten.shtml|accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> Although relief pitchers often [[Games pitched|appear]] in more than the requisite number of games, they rarely record ten wins in a season.  However, the use of relief pitchers increases a starter's chance of a no decision, further limiting the ability to break the record.

Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on [[sabermetrics]]\u2014in this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22378|title=Baseball Prospectus  \u2013 Baseball Therapy: What Happened to the Complete Game?|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>  While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \"quality innings,\" at which point the manager\u2014who, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count\u2014will normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballmagazine.net/2015/09/04/lost-art-of-the-complete-game/|title=Lost Art of the Complete Game|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> There are exceptions\u2014a manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had [[Tommy John surgery]] or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm.\n\nThese changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2. The 2019 season was similar in both respects, with 45 total complete games and no pitcher having more than 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/CG_top_ten.shtml |title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Complete Games |website=Baseball-Reference |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref> In a 2019 story, Sam Miller of [[ESPN]] went so far as to say, \"In your lifetime, you might very well see the last complete game.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26295852/how-many-complete-games-thrown-2019-thirty-ten-none |title=How many complete games will be thrown in 2019?

Since 1928, there have been only 46 seasons in which a hitter reached .366 and only [[Tony Gwynn]] attained that mark at least four times, finishing with a career .338 batting average.<ref>{{cite web|title=.366 lifetime batting average \u2013 Ty Cobb \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.3.html|accessdate=November 27, 2011|publisher=SI.com}}</ref>  At the end of the 2019 season, [[Miguel Cabrera]] leads active players in career batting average, fractionally above [[Jos\u00e9 Altuve]] (.3146 to .3145).<ref>{{cite web|title=Active Leaders & Records for Batting Average|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/batting_avg_active.shtml|accessdate=September 30, 2019 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>\n\n=== Highest single-season batting average \u2013 .440===\nSet by [[Hugh Duffy]] in 1894, the highest single-season average in National League, and MLB history. Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901 is the highest in American League history. In the modern (post-\"dead-ball\") era, [[Rogers Hornsby]] hit .424 in 1924, a feat unmatched since then. [[George Sisler]]'s .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. [[Ted Williams]] hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only [[George Brett]], who hit .390 in 1980, and [[Tony Gwynn]], who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs.\n\nIn a 2018 ESPN story, the aforementioned Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play\u2014a group of skills which largely do not complement one another.<ref name=\"Miller 400\"/>\n\n=== Most RBI in a season \u2013 191 ===\nSet by [[Hack Wilson]], who batted in 191 runs in 1930. Only [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Hank Greenberg]], at 184 and 183 [[Run batted in|RBI]] respectively, ever came close, and there have been no real challenges to the record for over 75 years.\n\nHowever, Sam Miller argued in 2019 that a serious challenge to Wilson's record, though highly unlikely, was less implausible than challenges to many of the other records listed here. He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of base-runners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\"<ref name=\"Miller 2019 unbreakable\"/>  However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \"three true outcomes\" \u2013 a home run, walk, or strikeout<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three_True_Outcomes Three True Outcomes, Baseball-reference.com]</ref> \u2013 there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.\n\n=== Highest career on-base percentage \u2013 .482 ===\n[[File:Ted Williams BBall Digest May 1949 raw.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Williams]] topped a .400 on-base percentage 18 times in his 19 years, often by 100 points or more, including .553 en route to a .406 batting average in 1941, the last season ever over .400.]]\n\nSet by [[Ted Williams]] from 1939 to 1960.<ref name=Williams>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1005/mlb.unbreakable.baseball.records/content.9.html |title=.482 lifetime on-base percentage \u2013 Ted Williams \u2013 Unbreakable Baseball Records |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]], and two MVP awards.

Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]], which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games.\n\nBecause the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the [[World Series]].\n\nBoth the individual and team single-season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with [[one-game playoff]]s. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. The American League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nNo team has played more than 163 regular season games in a season since 1962. While there have been a few occasions where a three-way tie was possible going into the last day of the season (which would result in a team playing 164 games), a three-way tie involving postseason berths has never occurred. From 1969 to 1993, it would have been impossible for any team to be involved in more than three one-game playoffs in a season, since only division champions qualified for the postseason and since there was never more than eight teams per division. As of the end of the 2018 season, there has yet to be an occasion in MLB history where five teams of one league have finished with identical records, which would have been the circumstance needed during this era for any team to play even three tie-breakers and thus match the 1962 record.\n\nSince the introduction of the wild card, it has been technically possible to play 166 regular season games, but is extremely unlikely. For a team to have an opportunity to play four tiebreaker games, it would have to be involved in a tie involving three or more teams for the division crown ''and'' a separate tie also involving three or more teams for the second wild card berth, meaning that the aforementioned-unprecedented circumstance at least five teams in two different divisions of the same league finishing with identical records would have to occur. A team in such a situation would then have to win the division \"semi-final\" tiebreaker, lose the division \"final\" and then win the wild card \"semi-final\" in order to play 166 regular season games. The 2018 season, which resulted in two two-way ties for division titles, was the first occasion where there were even multiple two-way ties for division titles - the losers of the 2018 tiebreaker games (who did not themselves have identical records) subsequently played each other in the Wild Card Game, but that game is considered part of the postseason and not the regular season.\n\nWills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players, part of a new ''metric''-based strategy known as \"load management\". On average only about three players in all of baseball appear in all 162 games of any given MLB season. This implies that even if a club somehow managed to play 166 regular season games, there is mathematically only about a ten percent chance a particular team will have a player who will have appeared in all 162 games pending tie-breakers.\n\nIt is also possible for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season by virtue of a mid-season trade.  A swap between a team that has played more games and one which has played fewer can result in a schedule for the traded player to be greater than either individual teams'.

With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, almost all of which occurred while he played in the AL, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs,<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ferrewe01</ref> and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers. Other American League pitchers with notable home-run totals include [[Bob Lemon]], who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; [[Red Ruffing]], who smacked 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], who hit out 35 home runs in an 11-year career \u2013 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter \u2013 all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=wilsoea01</ref> With \"good-hitting pitchers\" the exception rather than the rule, the American League's adoption of the [[designated hitter]] rule in 1973 \u2013 leading to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's traditional #9 slot in the batting order in all AL games and all interleague, All-Star and World Series games played in AL parks &ndash; means that no American League pitcher will ever get enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics, or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically. However, the [[Los Angeles Angels]]' signing of Japanese player [[Shohei Ohtani]] \u2014 who notably plays as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter &mdash; could mean that Ferrell's record could be broken (although Ohtani generally does not hit and pitch in the same game when playing in AL parks, so his home runs as a DH may not be considered as being hit \"by a pitcher\").\n\n=== Most career sacrifice bunts \u2013 512 ===\nSet by [[Eddie Collins]], who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics. [[Joe Pasternak]] dubbed Collins as \"the smartest player in baseball history\". Not only was Collins a prolific bunter, but also 10th all-time in [[Wins Above Replacement|WAR]] and hit .333 for his career with 3,315 hits and 745 stolen bases.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisachit1.shtml</ref> Second behind him is [[Jake Daubert]] with 392, more than 100 fewer than Collins. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: ''[[Moneyball]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]], the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \"evil\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position.

They were so bad \u2013 20 wins below the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] \u2013 they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a season at the same time.\n\nWhat is unusual, however, about their road loss record compared to others on this list in that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot mathematically be broken even if a team achieved a completely [[winless season]] on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tourtellotte|first=Shane|title=The unbreakable records|date=September 18, 2013|work=The Hardball Times|url=https://tht.fangraphs.com/the-unbreakable-records/|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[rainout (sports)|rainouts]] and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, there is no way to accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record. The only situation in which regular season games are ever added to the schedule is in the case of the [[one-game playoff]]; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game are infinitesimally small. In the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the [[legal fiction]] that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose [[home advantage|rules advantages]]. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to road games.\n\nThree other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record:\n* In 1899, owners were allowed to own more than one team, and in the case of the Spiders, the owners also owned the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]]. Believing it more profitable to have a good team in St. Louis, the Spiders' best players from 1898 \u2013 including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitchers [[Cy Young]], [[Jesse Burkett]] and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]] \u2013 were given to the Perfectos in exchange for their least desirable players, with their manager, [[Patsy Tebeau]]. From 1900, MLB rules have prohibited a single owner owning more than one team to avoid any repeat of this, or any simliar, arrangements.\n* Baseball teams in 1899 had gate receipts as their main source for revenue. Since fans in Cleveland were not going to pay to watch a decimated roster, the Spiders/Perfectos ownership transferred all of the Spiders' home games against the Perfectos to St. Louis. As the season wore on and the crowds in Cleveland shrunk in response to mounting losses, the other 11 NL teams requested the Spiders transfer home games to their parks, as their cut of the gate receipts would leave them unable to recoup the expenses of the journey. Since the Spiders' cut of the gate receipts for road games was far more lucrative than their gate receipts for home games, the Spiders' owners were not inclined to object to such requests. Thus, the Spiders only played eight home games after July 1, giving them the opportunity for 101 road losses (against 11 wins). \n** Today, MLB revenue streams are far more numerous, while in the case of media rights are often both contractually dependent on teams playing their entire schedule, and are not affected by attendance, while travel expenses make up a much smaller portion of a team's budget. MLB rules also state any team that refuses to travel to their opponent's stadium for a scheduled game would immediately [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] the game.\n* The 1899 Spiders played their entire 154-game schedule \u2013 an unusual occurrence in an era when cancellations were much more frequent, and cancelled games were often not made up.\n\nThe 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40\u2013120, .250 winning percentage) and the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003 Detroit Tigers]] (43\u2013119, .265 winning percentage).\n\nSince 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of cancelled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).\n\n=== Lowest paying attendance \u2013 6 ===\nThis was set by the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester baseball club]] in 1882.<ref name=worcester>Eduardo A.

He sought to destroy his enemies while transforming [[Culture of the Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet society]] with aggressive [[Economic planning#Soviet Union|economic planning]], in particular a sweeping [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|collectivization of agriculture]] and rapid [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|development of heavy industry]]. [[Stalin's rise to power|Stalin consolidated his power]] within the party and the state and fostered an extensive [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]]. [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret-police]] and the [[Mass mobilization#USSR|mass-mobilization]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] served as Stalin's major tools in molding Soviet society. [[Stalinism|Stalin's methods]] in achieving his goals, which included [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party purges]], [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repression of the general population]], and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]], led to [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|millions of deaths]]: in [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s and during [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine]].\n\nWorld War II, known as \"the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]\" by Soviet historians, devastated much of the [[USSR]], with about [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|one out of every three World War II deaths representing a citizen of the Soviet Union]]. After World War II, the Soviet Union's armies occupied [[Eastern Europe]], where they established or supported [[Soviet sphere of influence|Communist puppet governments]]. By 1949, the [[Cold War]] had started between the [[Western Bloc]] and the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern (Soviet) Bloc]], with the [[Warsaw Pact]] (created 1955) pitched against [[NATO]] (created 1949) in Europe. After 1945, Stalin did not directly engage in any wars, continuing his [[totalitarian]] rule until his death in 1953.\n\n==Soviet state's development==\n\n===Industrialization in practice===\n{{main|Industrialization in the Soviet Union}}\nThe mobilization of resources by state planning expanded the country's industrial base. From 1928 to 1932, pig iron output, necessary for further development of the industrial infrastructure rose from 3.3 million to 6.2 million tons per year. Coal production, a basic fuel of modern economies and Stalinist [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], rose from 35.4 million to 64 million tons, and the output of iron ore rose from 5.7 million to 19 million tons.  A number of industrial complexes such as [[Magnitogorsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk|Kuznetsk]], the Moscow and [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] automobile plants, the [[Ural Mountains]] and Kramatorsk heavy [[machinery]] plants, and Kharkiv, [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and [[Chelyabinsk]] tractor plants had been built or were under construction.<ref>Martin Mccauley, ''The Soviet Union 1917\u20131991'' (Routledge, 2014). p. 81.</ref>\n\nIn real terms, the workers' standards of living tended to drop, rather than rise during industrialization. Stalin's laws to \"tighten work discipline\" made the situation worse: e.g., a 1932 change to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] labor law code enabled firing workers who had been absent without a reason from the workplace for just one day. Being fired accordingly meant losing \"the right to use ration and commodity cards\" as well as the \"loss of the right to use an apartment\u2033 and even blacklisted for new employment which altogether meant a threat of starving.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/trud-uvol32-e.html | title= On Firing for Unexcused Absenteeism | publisher=Cyber USSR | accessdate= 2010-08-01}}</ref> Those measures, however, were not fully enforced, as managers were hard-pressed to replace these workers.  In contrast, the 1938 legislation, which introduced labor books, followed by major revisions of the labor law, was enforced. For example, being absent or even 20 minutes late were grounds for becoming fired; managers who failed to enforce these laws faced criminal prosecution. Later, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, 26 June 1940 \"On the Transfer to the Eight-Hour Working Day, the Seven-day Work Week, and on the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk-trud-e.html | title=On the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices | publisher = Cyber USSR | accessdate= 2010-08-01}}</ref> replaced the 1938 revisions with obligatory criminal penalties for quitting a job (2\u20134 months imprisonment), for being late 20 minutes (6 months of probation and pay confiscation of 25 per cent), etc.\n\nBased on these figures, the Soviet government declared that the Five Year Industrial Production Plan had been fulfilled by 93.7% in only four years, while parts devoted to the heavy-industry parts were fulfilled by 108%. Stalin in December 1932 declared the plan success to the Central Committee since increases in the output of coal and iron would fuel future development.<ref>, Martin Mccauley, ''Stalin and Stalinism'' (3rd ed. 2013) p. 39.</ref>\n\nDuring the second five-year plan (1933\u201337), on the basis of the huge investment during the first plan, the industry expanded extremely rapidly and nearly reached the plan's targets. By 1937, coal output was 127 million tons, pig iron 14.5 million tons, and there had been very rapid development of the armaments industry.<ref>E. A. Rees, ''Decision-making in the Stalinist Command Economy, 1932\u201337'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1997)  212\u201313.</ref>\n\nWhile making a massive leap in industrial capacity, the First Five Year Plan was extremely harsh on industrial workers; quotas were difficult to fulfill, requiring that miners put in 16- to 18-hour workdays.<ref>, Andrew B. Somers, ''History of Russia'' (Monarch Press, 1965) p. 77.</ref> Failure to fulfill quotas could result in treason charges.<ref>''Problems of Communism'' (1989) \u2013 Volume 38 p.  137</ref> Working conditions were poor, even hazardous. Due to the allocation of resources for the industry along with decreasing productivity since collectivization, a famine occurred. In the construction of the industrial complexes, inmates of [[Gulag]] camps were used as expendable resources. But conditions improved rapidly during the second plan. Throughout the 1930s, industrialization was combined with a rapid expansion of technical and engineering education as well as increasing emphasis on munitions.<ref>Mark Harrison and Robert W.

The estimated numbers vary greatly. Perhaps, 3.7 million people were sentenced for alleged counter-revolutionary crimes, including 600,000 sentenced to death, 2.4 million sentenced to labor camps, and 700,000 sentenced to [[Expatriate|expatriation]]. Stalinist repression reached its peak during the Great Purge of 1937\u201338, which removed many skilled managers and experts and considerably slowed industrial production in 1937<ref>Vadim Birstein ''Smersh: Stalin's Secret Weapon'' (Biteback Publishing, 2013) pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n===Collectivization of agriculture===\n{{Main|Collectivisation in the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:McCormick-Deering 15-30 The First Tractor Propaganda Shot.jpg|thumb|Propaganda shows the use of tractors (in this case McCormick-Deering 15-30) as a backbone of collectivization. [[Soviet Ukraine]], 1931]]\nUnder the NEP, Lenin had to tolerate the continued existence of privately owned agriculture. He decided to wait at least 20 years before attempting to place it under state control and in the meantime concentrate on industrial development. However, after Stalin's rise to power, the timetable for collectivization was shortened to just five years. Demand for food intensified, especially in the USSR's primary grain producing regions, [[Ural-Siberian method|with new, forced approaches implemented]]. Upon joining [[kolkhoz]]es (collective farms), peasants had to give up their private plots of land and property. Every harvest, Kolkhoz production was sold to the state for a low price set by the state itself. However, the natural progress of collectivization was slow, and the November 1929 Plenum of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] decided to accelerate collectivization through force. In any case, Russian peasant culture formed a bulwark of traditionalism that stood in the way of the Soviet state's goals.\n\nGiven the goals of the first Five Year Plan, the state sought increased political control of agriculture in order to feed the rapidly growing urban population and to obtain a source of foreign currency through increased cereal exports. Given its late start, the USSR needed to import a substantial number of the expensive technologies necessary for heavy industrialization.\n\nBy 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture had been collectivized. In many cases, peasants bitterly opposed this process and often slaughtered their animals rather than give them to collective farms, even though the government only wanted the grain. [[Kulak]]s, prosperous peasants, were forcibly resettled to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], Siberia and the Russian Far North (a large portion of the kulaks served at forced labor camps). However, just about anyone opposing collectivization was deemed a \"kulak\".  The policy of liquidation of kulaks as a class\u2014formulated by Stalin at the end of 1929\u2014meant some executions, and even more deportation to special settlements and, sometimes, to forced labor camps.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hudson|first=Hugh D.|chapter=Liquidation of Kulak Influence, War Panic, and the Elimination of the Kulaks as a Class, 1927\u20131929|date=2012|work=Peasants, Political Police, and the Early Soviet State: Surveillance and Accommodation under the New Economic Policy|pages=89\u2013111|editor-last=Hudson|editor-first=Hugh D.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137010544_6|isbn=9781137010544|title=Peasants, Political Police, and the Early Soviet State}}</ref>\n\nDespite the expectations, collectivization led to a catastrophic drop in farm productivity, which did not return to the levels achieved under the NEP until 1940. The upheaval associated with collectivization was particularly severe in Ukraine and the heavily Ukrainian Volga region. Peasants slaughtered their livestock en masse rather than give them up. In 1930 alone, 25% of the nation's cattle, sheep, and goats, and one-third of all pigs were killed. It was not until the 1980s that the Soviet livestock numbers would return to their 1928 level. Government bureaucrats, who had been given a rudimentary education on farming techniques, were dispatched to the countryside to \"teach\" peasants the new ways of socialist agriculture, relying largely on Marxist theoretical ideas that had little basis in reality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/famine-and-oppression/|title=Famine and Oppression {{!}} History of Western Civilization II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> Even after the state inevitably won and succeeding in imposing collectivization, the peasants did everything they could in the way of sabotage. They cultivated far smaller portions of their land and worked much less. The scale of the Ukrainian famine has led many Ukrainian scholars to argue that there was a deliberate policy of [[Holodomor|genocide against the Ukrainian people]]. Other scholars argue that the massive death totals were an inevitable result of a very poorly planned operation against all peasants, who had given little support to Lenin or Stalin. \n{{Quote|text=Almost 99% of all cultivated land had been pulled into collective farms by the end of 1937.

By 1937, the number rose yet again, to about 7.9 million. Finally, in 1940 it reached 8.3 million. Between 1926 and 1930, the urban population increased by 30 million. Unemployment had been a problem in late Imperial Russia and even under the NEP, but it ceased being a major factor after the implementation of Stalin's massive industrialization program. The sharp mobilization of resources used in order to industrialize the heretofore agrarian society created a massive need for labor; unemployment virtually dropped to zero. Wage setting by Soviet planners also contributed to the sharp decrease in unemployment, which dropped in real terms by 50% from 1928 to 1940. With wages artificially depressed, the state could afford to employ far more workers than would be financially viable in a market economy. Several ambitious extraction projects were begun that endeavored to supply raw materials for both military hardware and consumer goods.\n\nThe Moscow and [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] automobile plants produced automobiles for the public\u2014despite few Soviet citizens affording to buy a car\u2014and the expansion of steel production and other industrial materials made the manufacture of a greater number of cars possible. Car and truck production, for example, reached 200,000 in 1931.{{Sfn | Tucker | 1990 | p = 96}}\n\n==Society==\n===Propaganda===\nMost of the top communist leaders in the 1920s and 1930s had been propagandists or editors before 1917, and were keenly aware of the importance of propaganda. As soon as they gained power in 1917 they seized the monopoly of all communication media, and greatly expanded their propaganda apparatus in terms of newspapers, magazines and pamphlets. Radio became a powerful tool in the 1930s.  <ref>David Brandenberger, ''Propaganda state in crisis: Soviet ideology, indoctrination, and terror under Stalin, 1927-1941'' (2012).</ref> Stalin, for example, has been an editor of ''Pravda''. Besides the national newspapers \"PRAVDA\" and ''Izvestia,'' there were numerous regional publications as well as newspapers and magazines and all the important languages. Ironclad uniformity of opinion was the norm during the Soviet era. Typewriters and printing presses were closely controlled into the 1980s to prevent unauthorized publications. [[Samizdat]] illegal circulation of subversive fiction and nonfiction was brutally suppressed. The rare exceptions to 100% uniformity in the official media were indicators of high-level battles.  The Soviet draft constitution of 1936 was an instance. ''Pravda'' and ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' (the paper for manual workers) praised the draft constitution. However ''Izvestiia'' was controlled by [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and it published negative letters and reports. Bukharin won out and the party line changed and started to attack \"Trotskyite\" oppositionists and traitors. Bukharin's success was short-lived; he was arrested in 1937, given a show trial and executed.<ref>Ellen Wimberg, \"Socialism, democratism and criticism: The Soviet press and the national discussion of the 1936 draft constitution.\" ''Europe\u2010Asia Studies'' 44#2 (1992): 313-332. </ref>\n\n===Education===\nFor propaganda to be effective it had to reach the entire population, yet the great majority of peasants were illiterate. The success of communism depended on their becoming literate. Industrial workers needed to be educated in order to be competitive and so embarked on a program contemporaneous with industrialization to greatly increase the number of schools and the general quality of education.  In 1927, 7.9 million students attended 118,558 schools. By 1933, the number rose to 9.7 million students in 166,275 schools. In addition, 900 specialist departments and 566 institutions were built and fully operational by 1933. Literacy rates increased substantially as a result, especially in the Central Asian republics.{{Sfn | Tucker | 1990 | p = 228}}<ref>Boris N.

Women were to be given the same education as men and, at least legally speaking, obtained the same rights as men in the workplace. Although in practice these goals were not reached, the efforts to achieve them and the statement of theoretical equality led to a general improvement in the socio-economic status of women. \n===Health===\nStalinist development also contributed to advances in health care, which marked a massive improvement over the Imperial era.  Stalin's policies granted the Soviet people access to free health care and education.  Widespread immunization programs created the first generation free from the fear of typhus and cholera.  The occurrences of these diseases dropped to record-low numbers and infant mortality rates were substantially reduced, resulting in the [[life expectancy]] for both men and women to increase by over 20 years by the mid-to-late 1950s.<ref name = \"rand\">{{Citation | editor1-first = Julie | editor1-last = Da Vanzo | editor2-first = Gwen | editor2-last = Farnsworth | url = https://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF124/ | title = Russia's Demographic \"Crisis\" | pages =115\u201321 | year = 1996 | publisher = [[RAND]] | isbn = 978-0-8330-2446-6}}.</ref> \n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Komsomol poster 1933.jpg|thumb|left|225px|1933 Komsomol poster.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42867730 online]</ref> The Komsomol played an important role as a mechanism for teaching Party values to the younger generation. The Komsomol also served as a mobile pool of labor and political activism, with the ability to relocate to areas of high-priority at short notice. In the 1920s the Kremlin assigned Komsomol major responsibilities for promoting industrialization at the factory level. In 1929 7,000 Komsomol cadets were building the tractor factory in Stalingrad, 56,000 others built factories in the Urals, and 36,000 were assigned work underground in the coal mines. The goal was to provide an energetic hard-core of Bolshevik activists to influence their coworkers the factories and mines that were at the center of communist ideology.<ref> Hannah Dalton, ''Tsarist and Communist Russia, 1855\u20131964 ''  (2015) p 132. </ref><ref>Hilary Pilkington, ''Russia's Youth and its Culture: A Nation's Constructors and Constructed'' (1995) pp 57-60.</ref>\n\nKomsomol adopted meritocratic, supposedly class-blind membership policies in 1935, but the result was a decline in working class youth members, and a dominance by the better educated youth. A new social hierarchy emerged as young professionals and students joined the Soviet elite, displacing proletarians.  Komsomol's membership policies in the 1930s reflected the broader nature of Stalinism, combining Leninist rhetoric about class-free progress with Stalinist pragmatism focused on getting the most enthusiastic and skilled membership.<ref>Seth Bernstein, \"Class Dismissed?

Education was another area in which there was improvement after economic development, also paralleling other western countries.  The generation born during Stalin's rule was the first near-universally literate generation. Some engineers were sent abroad to learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on contract. Transport links were also improved, as many new railways were built, although with forced labour, costing thousands of lives. Workers who exceeded their quotas, ''[[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovite]]s'', received many incentives for their work, although many such workers were in fact \"arranged\" to succeed by receiving extreme help in their work, and then their achievements were used for propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheila Fitzpatrick|title=Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times : Soviet Russia in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3M8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|year=2000|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=8\u201310|isbn=9780195050011}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Further|Religion in the Soviet Union}}\nThe systematic attacks on the Russian Orthodox church began as soon as the Bolsheviks took power in 1917.

In 1937, [[Pope Pius XI]] decried the attacks on religion in the Soviet Union. By 1940, only a small number of churches remained open. The early anti-religious campaigns under Lenin were mostly directed at the Russian Orthodox Church, as it was a symbol of the czarist government. In the 1930s however, all faiths were targeted: minority Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  In the long run atheism failed to win many souls. Religion strengthened underground and was revived to help fight the Second World War. It flourished after the fall of Communism in the 1990s. As Paul Froese explains:\n:Atheists waged a 70-year war on religious belief in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques, and temples; it executed religious leaders; it flooded the schools and media with anti-religious propaganda; and it introduced a belief system called \u201cscientific atheism,\u201d complete with atheist rituals, proselytizers, and a promise of worldly salvation. But in the end, a majority of older Soviet citizens retained their religious beliefs and a crop of citizens too young to have experienced pre-Soviet times acquired religious beliefs.<ref>Paul Froese, Paul. \"Forced secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an atheistic monopoly failed.\" ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 43.1 (2004): 35-50.

In 1936\u201338, about three quarters of a million Soviets were executed, and more than a million others were sentenced to lengthy terms in very harsh labour camps. Stalin's Great Terror ravaged the ranks of factory directors and engineers, and removed most of the senior officers in the Army.<ref>James Harris, ''The Great Fear: Stalin\u2019s Terror of the 1930s'' (2017), p. 1 [https://www.amazon.com/Great-Fear-Stalins-Terror-1930s/dp/0199695768 excerpt]</ref> The pretext was the 1934 assassination of [[Sergey Kirov]] (which many suspect Stalin of having planned, although there is no evidence for this).<ref>Matt Lenoe,  \"Did Stalin Kill Kirov and Does It Matter?.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 74.2 (2002): 352-380. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/343411 online]</ref> Nearly all the old pre-1918 Bolsheviks were purged. Trotsky was expelled from the party in 1927, exiled to Kazakhstan in 1928, expelled from the USSR in 1929, and assassinated in 1940. Stalin used the purges to politically and physically destroy his other formal rivals (and former allies) accusing [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] of being behind Kirov's assassination and planning to overthrow Stalin. Ultimately, the people arrested were tortured and forced to confess to being spies and saboteurs, and quickly convicted and executed.<ref>James Harris, ''The Anatomy of Terror: Political Violence under Stalin'' (2013)</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Moscow Trials|show trial]]s were held in Moscow, to serve as examples for the trials that local courts were expected to carry out elsewhere in the country. There were four key trials from 1936 to 1938, The Trial of the Sixteen was the first (December 1936); then the Trial of the Seventeen (January 1937); then the trial of [[Red Army]] generals, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Marshal Tukhachevsky]] (June 1937); and finally the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites\"|Trial of the Twenty One]] (including [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|Bukharin]]) in March 1938. During these, the defendants typically confessed to sabotage, spying, counter-revolution, and conspiring with Germany and Japan to invade and partition the Soviet Union. The initial trials in 1935\u201336 were carried out by the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] under [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. In turn the prosecutors were tried and executed. The secret police were renamed the [[NKVD]] and control given to [[Nikolai Yezhov]], known as the \"Bloody Dwarf\".<ref> Arkadi\u012d Vaksberg and Jan Butler, ''The Prosecutor and the Prey: Vyshinsky and the 1930s' Moscow Show Trials'' (1990).</ref>\n\nThe \"Great Purge\" swept the Soviet Union in 1937. It was widely known as the \"Yezhovschina\", the \"Reign of Yezhov\". The rate of arrests was staggering. In the armed forces alone, 34,000 officers were purged including many at the higher ranks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Roberts|title=Stalin's General: The Life of Georgy Zhukov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOxRrfalHJcC&pg=PT58|year=2012|publisher=Icon Books|pages=58\u201359|isbn=9781848314436}}</ref>   The entire Politburo and most of the Central Committee were purged, along with foreign communists who were living in the Soviet Union, and numerous intellectuals, bureaucrats, and factory managers.

Yezhov was gradually relieved of power. Yezhov was relieved of all powers in 1939, then tried and executed in 1940. His successor as head of the NKVD (from 1938 to 1945) was [[Lavrentiy Beria]], a Georgian friend of Stalin's. Arrests and executions continued into 1952, although nothing on the scale of the Yezhovschina ever happened again.\n\nDuring this period, the practice of mass arrest, torture, and imprisonment or execution without trial, of anyone suspected by the secret police of opposing Stalin's regime became commonplace. By the NKVD's own count, 681,692 people were shot during 1937\u201338 alone, and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners were transported to Gulag work camps.<ref>{{cite book|author= Gregory|title=Terror by Quota: State Security from Lenin to Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DH57dXl_agC&pg=PA16|year=2009|page=16|isbn=978-0300152784}}</ref>\nThe mass terror and purges were little known to the outside world, and some western intellectuals and fellow travellers continued to believe that the Soviets had created a successful alternative to a capitalist world . In 1936, the country adopted its [[1936 Soviet Constitution|first formal constitution]], which only on paper granted freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.\n\nIn March 1939, the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th congress of the Communist Party]] was held in Moscow. Most of the delegates present at the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|17th congress]] in 1934 were gone, and Stalin was heavily praised by Litvinov and the western democracies criticized for failing to adopt the principles of \"collective security\" against Nazi Germany.\n\n===Interpreting the purges===\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that:  Stalin and other top leaders, using Marxist notions that they were always surrounded by enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army. It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276. </ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79. </ref>  Historians often cite the disruption as factors in its disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

Foreign investors did not receive any monetary or material compensation. The USSR also refused to pay tsarist-era debts to foreign debtors. The young Soviet polity was a pariah because of its openly stated goal of supporting the overthrow of capitalistic governments. It sponsored workers' revolts to overthrow numerous capitalistic European states, but they all failed. Lenin reversed radical experiments and restored a sort of capitalism with NEC. The Comintern was ordered to stop organizing revolts. Starting in 1921 Lenin sought trade, loans and recognition. One by one, foreign states reopened trade lines and recognized the Soviet government. The United States was the last major polity to recognise the USSR in 1933. In 1934, the French government proposed an alliance and led 30 governments to invite the USSR to join the League of Nations. The USSR had achieved legitimacy but was expelled in December 1939 for aggression against Finland.<ref>George F. Kennan, ''Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin'' (1961) pp 172-259.</ref><ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974'' (1974) pp 336-54.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Stalin pushed a leftist policy based on his belief in an imminent great crisis for capitalism. Various European communist parties were ordered not to form coalitions and instead to denounce moderate socialists as fascists. Activists were sent into labour unions to take control away from socialists\u2013a move the British unions never forgave. By 1930, the Stalinists started suggesting the value of alliance with other parties, and by 1934 the idea to form a [[Popular Front]] had emerged. Comintern agent [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]] was especially effective in organizing intellectuals, antiwar and pacifist elements to join the anti-Nazi coalition.<ref>Sean McMeekin, ''The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, Moscow\u2019s Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West'' (2003) pp 115-16, 194.</ref> Communists would form coalitions with any party to fight fascism.

While the Soviet Union was interested in conquering territories in Eastern Europe, France was determined to protect the fledgling states there. However, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign policy centered on a massive seizure of Central European, Eastern European, and Russian lands for Germany's own ends, and when Hitler pulled out of the [[World Disarmament Conference]] in Geneva in 1933, the threat hit home. Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] reversed Soviet policy regarding the Paris Peace Settlement, leading to a Franco-Soviet rapprochement. In May 1935, the USSR concluded pacts of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. Stalin-ordered the [[Communist International|Comintern]] to form a [[Popular Front (France)|popular front]] with leftist and centrist parties against the forces of [[Fascism]]. The pact was undermined, however, by strong ideological hostility to the Soviet Union and the Comintern's new front in France, Poland's refusal to permit the [[Red Army]] on its soil, France's defensive military strategy, and a continuing Soviet interest in patching up relations with Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Soviet Union supplied military aid to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] in the [[Second Spanish Republic]], including munitions and soldiers, and helped far-left activists come to Spain as volunteers. The Spanish government let the USSR have the government treasury. Soviet units systematically liquidated anarchist supporters of the Spanish government. Moscow's support of the government gave the Republicans a Communist taint in the eyes of anti-Bolsheviks in Britain and France, weakening the calls for Anglo-French intervention in the war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCannon\n|first=John|date=1995|title=Soviet Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, 1936\u201339: A Reexamination|journal=Russian History|volume=22|issue=2|pages=154\u2013180|issn=0094-288X|jstor=24657802|doi=10.1163/187633195X00070}}</ref>\n\nNazi Germany promulgated an [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Imperialist Japan and Fascist Italy, along with various Central and Eastern European states (such as [[Hungary between the World Wars|Hungary]]), ostensibly to suppress Communist activity but more realistically to forge an alliance against the USSR.<ref>Lorna L.

A secret appendix to the pact gave Eastern Poland, Latvia, Estonia, [[Bessarabia]] and Finland to the USSR, and Western Poland and [[Lithuania]] to Nazi Germany. This reflected the Soviet desire of territorial gains.\n\nFollowing the pact with Hitler, Stalin in 1939-40 annexed half of Poland, the three Baltic States, and Northern  Bukovina and Bessarabia in Romania. They no longer were buffers separating the USSR from German areas, argues Louis Fischer.

Helsinki, backed by world public opinion refused, so Stalin invaded.  Despite outnumbering Finnish troops by over 2.5:1, the war proved embarrassingly difficult for the Red Army, which was ill-equipped for the winter weather and lacking competent commanders since the [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|purge of the Soviet high command]]. The Finns resisted fiercely, and received some support and considerable sympathy from the Allies. A new threat in March 1940 led Finland to ask an armistice.

Stalin had made no preparations. Soviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation and the invasion caught the Soviet military unprepared.  In the larger sense, Stalin expected invasion but not so soon.<ref name=Murphy>{{Citation | first = David E | last = Murphy | title = What Stalin Knew: the enigma of Barbarossa | year = 2005 }}.</ref> The Army had been decimated by the Purges; time was needed for a recovery of competence. As such, mobilization did not occur and the Soviet Army was tactically unprepared as of the invasion. The initial weeks of the war were a disaster, with tens of thousands of men being killed, wounded, or captured. Whole divisions disintegrated against the German onslaught.\n\nGerman troops reached the outskirts of Moscow in December 1941, but failed to capture it, due to staunch Soviet defence and counterattacks. At the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942\u201343, the Red Army inflicted a crushing defeat on the German army.  Due to the unwillingness of the Japanese to open a second front in [[Manchuria]], the Soviets were able to call dozens of Red Army divisions back from eastern Russia. These units were instrumental in turning the tide, because most of their officer corps had escaped Stalin's purges. The Soviet forces soon launched massive counterattacks along the entire German line. By 1944, the Germans had been pushed out of the Soviet Union onto the banks of the [[Vistula]] river, just east of Prussia. With Soviet Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] attacking from Prussia, and Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] slicing Germany in half from the south, the fate of [[Nazi Germany]] was sealed. On May 2, 1945 the last German troops surrendered to the overjoyed Soviet troops in Berlin.\n\n===Wartime developments===\n{{further|Home front during World War II#Soviet Union}}\nFrom the end of 1944 to 1949, large sections of eastern Germany came under the Soviet Union's occupation and on 2 May 1945, the capital city Berlin was taken, while over fifteen million Germans were removed from eastern Germany and pushed into central Germany (later called the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]) and western Germany (later called the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]). Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, Czech, etc., were then moved onto German land.\n\nAn atmosphere of [[Soviet socialist patriotism|patriotic emergency]] took over the Soviet Union during the war, and persecution of the Orthodox Church was halted. The Church was now permitted to operate with a fair degree of freedom, so long as it did not get involved in politics. In 1944, a [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union|new Soviet national anthem]] was written, replacing [[the Internationale]], which had been used as the national anthem since 1918. These changes were made because it was thought that the people would respond better to a fight for their country than for a political ideology.\n\nThe Soviets bore the brunt of World War II because the West did not open up a second ground front in Europe until the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]. Approximately 26.6 million Soviets, among them 18 million civilians, were killed in the war. Civilians were rounded up and burned or shot in many cities conquered by the Nazis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The retreating Soviet army was ordered to pursue a '[[scorched earth]]' policy whereby retreating Soviet troops were ordered to destroy civilian infrastructure and food supplies so that the Nazi German troops could not use them.\n\nStalin's original declaration in March 1946 that there were 7 million war dead was revised in 1956 by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] with a round number of 20 million. In the late 1980s, demographers in the State Statistics Committee ([[Russian Federal State Statistics Service|Goskomstat]]) took another look using demographic methods and came up with an estimate of 26\u201327 million.

One study, relying on indirect evidence from the 1959 population census, found that while in terms of the aggregate human losses the major Slavic groups suffered most, the largest losses relative to population size were incurred by minority nationalities mainly from European Russia, among groups from which men were mustered to the front in \"nationality battalions\" and appear to have suffered disproportionately.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Barbara A | last1 = Anderson | first2 = Brian D | last2 = Silver | contribution = Demographic Consequences of World War II on the Non-Russian Nationalities of the USSR | editor-first = Susan J | editor-last = Linz | title = The Impact of World War II on the Soviet Union | place = Totowa, [[New Jersey|NJ]] | publisher = Rowman & Allanheld | year = 1985}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Union [[Soviet sphere of influence|occupied and dominated Eastern Europe]], in line with [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|their particular Marxist ideology]].\n\nStalin was determined to punish those peoples he saw as [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborating with Germany]] during the war and to deal with the problem of [[nationalism]], which would tend to pull the Soviet Union apart. Millions of Poles, Latvians, Georgians, Ukrainians and other ethnic minorities were deported to Gulags in Siberia. (Previously, following [[Soviet invasion of Poland|the 1939 annexation of eastern Poland]], thousands of Polish Army officers, including reservists, had been executed in the spring of 1940, in what came to be known as the [[Katyn massacre]].) In addition, in 1941, 1943 and 1944 several whole nationalities had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, including, among others, the [[Volga Germans]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Balkars]], [[Crimean Tatars]], and [[Meskhetian Turks]].  Though these groups were later politically \"rehabilitated\", some were never given back their former autonomous regions.<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Conquest | title = The Nation Killers: The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities | place = London | publisher = MacMillan | year = 1970 | isbn = 978-0-333-10575-7}}.</ref><ref name = \"Wimbush\">{{Citation | first1 = S Enders | last1 = Wimbush | first2 = Ronald | last2 = Wixman | title = The Meskhetian Turks: A New Voice in Central Asia | journal = Canadian Slavonic Papers | volume = 27 | number = 2\u20133 |date= 1975 | pages = 320\u201340| doi = 10.1080/00085006.1975.11091412 }}.</ref><ref name = \"Nekich\">{{Citation | author = Alexander Nekrich | author-link = Alexander Nekrich | title = The Punished Peoples: The Deportation and Fate of Soviet Minorities at the End of the Second World War | place = New York | publisher = WW Norton | year = 1978 | isbn = 978-0-393-00068-9}}.</ref><ref name = \"transfer\">[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]], Wikipedia.</ref>\n[[File:Everything for the Front, USSR WWII propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|\"Everything for the Front.

I drink, before all, to the health of the Russian people, because in this war they earned general recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the nationalities of our country...  And this trust of the Russian people in the Soviet Government was the decisive strength, which secured the historic victory over the enemy of humanity \u2013 over fascism...\"<ref>{{Citation | type = complete text of the toast | title = Russification| title-link = Russification}}.</ref>\n\nWorld War II resulted in enormous destruction of infrastructure and populations throughout Eurasia, from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, with almost no country left unscathed. The Soviet Union was especially devastated due to the mass destruction of the industrial base that it had built up in the 1930s. The USSR also experienced a major [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|famine]] in 1946\u201348 due to war devastation that cost an estimated 1 to 1.5 million lives as well as secondary population losses due to reduced fertility.{{Efn | Although the 1946 drought was severe, government mismanagement of its grain reserves largely accounted for the population losses.<ref>{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Ellman | title = The 1947 Soviet Famine and the Entitlement Approach to Famines | journal = Cambridge Journal of Economics | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | year = 2000 | pages = 603\u201330 | doi=10.1093/cje/24.5.603}}.</ref>}}  However, the Soviet Union recovered its production capabilities and overcame pre-war capabilities, becoming the country with the most powerful land army in history by the end of the war, and having the most powerful military production capabilities.\n\n====War and Stalinist industrial-military development====\nAlthough the Soviet Union received aid and weapons from the United States under the [[Lend-Lease]] program, the Soviet production of war materials was greater than that of Nazi Germany because of rapid growth of Soviet industrial production during the interwar years (additional supplies from lend-lease accounted for about 10\u201312% of the Soviet Union's own industrial output). The Second Five Year Plan raised [[steel]] production to 18 million tons and [[coal]] to 128 million tons. Before it was interrupted, the Third Five Year Plan produced no less than 19 million tons of steel and 150 million tons of coal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/library/special-collections-archives/first-five-year-plan|title=The First Five Year Plan, 1928-1932|date=2015-10-07|website=Special Collections & Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union's industrial output provided an armaments industry which supported their army, helping it resist the Nazi military offensive.  According to Robert L. Hutchings, \"One can hardly doubt that if there had been a slower buildup of industry, the attack would have been successful and world history would have evolved quite differently.\"<ref>Russia and the USSR, 1855\u20131991: Autocracy and Dictatorship p.147</ref> For the laborers involved in industry, however, life was difficult. Workers were encouraged to fulfill and overachieve quotas through [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda]], such as the [[Stakhanovite movement]].\n\nSome historians, however, interpret the lack of preparedness of the Soviet Union to defend itself as a flaw in Stalin's economic planning.  David Shearer, for example, argues that there was \"a command-administrative economy\" but it was not \"a planned one\". He argues that the Soviet Union was still suffering from the Great Purge, and was completely unprepared for the German invasion. Economist Holland Hunter, in addition, argues in his ''Overambitious First Soviet Five-Year Plan'', that an array \"of alternative paths were available, evolving out of the situation existing at the end of the 1920s... that could have been as good as those achieved by, say, 1936 yet with far less turbulence, waste, destruction and sacrifice.\"\n\n==The Cold War==\n{{Main|Cold War}}\n\n===Soviet control over Eastern Europe===\n{{main|Soviet sphere of influence}}\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|right|250px|Soviet expansion, change of [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[eastern Europe]]an borders and creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] after World War II]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Soviet Union extended its political and military influence over [[Eastern Europe]], in a move that was seen by some as a continuation of the older policies of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some territories that had been lost by Soviet Russia in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (1918) were annexed by the Soviet Union after World War II: the [[Baltic states]] and eastern portions of interwar Poland. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] also gained the northern half of East Prussia ([[Kaliningrad Oblast]]) from Germany. The [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] gained [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] (as [[Zakarpattia Oblast]]) from [[Czechoslovakia]], and Ukrainian populated Northern [[Bukovina]] (as [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]) from [[Romania]]. Finally, by the late 1940s, pro-Soviet Communist Parties won the elections in five countries of Central and Eastern Europe (specifically [[1947 Polish legislative election|Poland]], [[1948 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|Czechoslovakia]], [[1947 Hungarian parliamentary election|Hungary]], [[1946 Romanian general election|Romania]] and [[1945 Bulgarian parliamentary election|Bulgaria]]) and subsequently became [[People's democracy (Marxism-Leninism)|People's Democracies]]. These elections are generally regarded as [[Rigged election|rigged]], and the Western powers recognized them as [[show elections]]. For the duration of the Cold War, the countries of Eastern Europe became Soviet [[satellite state]]s \u2014 they were \"independent\" nations, which were [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Communist State]]s whose [[General Secretary]] had to be approved by the [[Kremlin]], and so their governments usually kept their policy in line with the wishes of the Soviet Union, although nationalistic forces and pressures within the satellite states played a part in causing some deviation from strict Soviet rule.\n\n===Tenor of Soviet\u2013U.S. relations===\nThe USSR urgently needed munitions, food and fuel that was provided by the U.S. and also Britain, primarily through [[Lend Lease]]. The three power kept in regular contact, with Stalin trying to maintain a veil of secrecy over internal affairs.  Churchill and other top Soviets visited Moscow, as did Roosevelt's top aide [[Harry Hopkins]]. Stalin repeatedly requested that the United States and Britain open a second front on the European continent; but the Allied invasion did not occur until June 1944, more than two years later. In the meantime, the Russians suffered high casualties, and the Soviets faced the brunt of German strength. The Allies pointed out that their intensive air bombardment was a major factor that Stalin ignored. <ref>Herbert Feis, ''Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin: The War They Waged and the Peace They Sought'' (Princeton, NJ, 1957).</ref><ref> William H. McNeill, ''America, Britain, & Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941-1946'' (1953)</ref><ref>Jonathan Fenby, ''Alliance: The Inside Story of How Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill Won One War and Began Another'' (2007) </ref>\n\n==Domestic events==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe mild political liberalization that took place in the Soviet Union during the war quickly came to an end in 1945. The Orthodox Church was generally left unmolested after the war and was even allowed to print small amounts of religious literature, but persecution of minority religions was resumed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Stalin and the Communist Party were given full credit for the victory over Germany, and generals such as Zhukov were demoted to regional commands (Ukraine in his case). With the onset of the Cold War, anti-Western propaganda was stepped up, with the capitalist world depicted as a decadent place where crime, unemployment, and poverty were rampant.\n\n[[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Art and science were subjected to rigorous censorship]].  Where previously The All- Russian Union of Writers [[Union of Soviet Writers|(AUW)]] had attempted to publish apolitical writing, The [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (RAPP) insisted on the importance of politics in literary work, and published content which primarily embodied the [[Proletarian literature|hegemony of the working-class values in fiction]].  The RAPP launched a campaign against the AUW chairman [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. It resulted in the defeat of the AUW, and they were replaced by the All-Russian Union of Soviet Writers, which strictly adopted the literary style of socialist realism. Soviet biology studies were heavily influenced by the now-discredited biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]], who rejected the concept of [[Mendelian inheritance]] in favor of a form of [[Lamarckism]]. In physics, the [[theory of relativity]] was dismissed as \"bourgeois idealism\". Much of this censorship was the work of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], known as Stalin's \"ideological hatchet man\",{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} until his death from a heart attack in 1948. [[Stalin's cult of personality]] reached its height in the postwar period, with his picture displayed in every school, factory, and government office, yet he rarely appeared in public. Postwar reconstruction proceeded rapidly, but as the emphasis was all on heavy industry and energy, living standards remained low, especially outside of the major cities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn October 1952, the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|first postwar party congress]] convened in Moscow. Stalin did not feel up to delivering the main report and for most of the proceedings sat in silence while [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] delivered the main speeches. He did suggest however that the party be renamed from \"The All-Union Party of Bolsheviks\" to \"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union\" on the grounds that \"There was once a time when it was necessary to distinguish ourselves from the Mensheviks, but there are no Mensheviks anymore. We are the entire party now.\" Stalin also mentioned his advancing age (two months away from 73) and suggested that it might be time to retire. Predictably, no one at the congress would dare agree with it and the delegates instead pleaded for him to stay.\n\nTerror by the secret police continued in the postwar period. Although nothing comparable to 1937 ever happened again, there were many smaller purges, including a mass purge of the Georgian party apparatus in 1951\u201352. Stalin's health also deteriorated precipitously after WWII. He suffered a stroke in the fall of 1945 and was ill for months. This was followed by another stroke in 1947. Stalin became less active in the day to day running of the state and instead of party meetings, preferred to invite the Politburo members to all-night dinners where he would watch movies and force them to get drunk and embarrass themselves or say something incriminating.\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main|Korean War}}\nIn 1950, the Soviet Union protested against the fact that the Chinese seat at the [[United Nations Security Council]] was held by the [[Taiwan|Nationalist government of China]], and boycotted the meetings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} While the Soviet Union was absent, the UN passed a resolution condemning North Korean actions and offering military support to South Korea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} After this incident the Soviet Union was never absent at the meetings of the Security Council.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Bibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies]]\n* [[Cold War]]\n* [[Collective farming]]\n* [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin]]\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Economy of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Great Purge]]\n* [[Gulag]]\n* [[History of Russia]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Islam in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Joseph Stalin]]\n* [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\n* [[Red Army]]\n* [[Russia]]\n* [[Russian Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Secret police]]\n* [[Soviet art]]\n* [[Soviet calendar]]\n* [[Political repression in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Politics of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Soviet Union]]\n* [[Superpower]]\n* [[Timeline of Russian history]]\n* [[World War II]]\n* [[X Article]]}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[File:State Emblem of the Soviet Union.svg|thumb|right|200px|Endorsed by the Constitution of the USSR in 1924, the State Emblem of the Soviet Union (above) was a hammer and sickle symbolizing the alliance of the working class and the peasantry.

He sought to destroy his enemies while transforming [[Culture of the Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet society]] with aggressive [[Economic planning#Soviet Union|economic planning]], in particular a sweeping [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|collectivization of agriculture]] and rapid [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|development of heavy industry]]. [[Stalin's rise to power|Stalin consolidated his power]] within the party and the state and fostered an extensive [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]]. [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret-police]] and the [[Mass mobilization#USSR|mass-mobilization]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] served as Stalin's major tools in molding Soviet society. [[Stalinism|Stalin's methods]] in achieving his goals, which included [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party purges]], [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repression of the general population]], and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]], led to [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|millions of deaths]]: in [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s and during [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine]].\n\nWorld War II, known as \"the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]\" by Soviet historians, devastated much of the [[USSR]], with about [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|one out of every three World War II deaths representing a citizen of the Soviet Union]]. After World War II, the Soviet Union's armies occupied [[Eastern Europe]], where they established or supported [[Soviet sphere of influence|Communist puppet governments]]. By 1949, the [[Cold War]] had started between the [[Western Bloc]] and the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern (Soviet) Bloc]], with the [[Warsaw Pact]] (created 1955) pitched against [[NATO]] (created 1949) in Europe. After 1945, Stalin did not directly engage in any wars, continuing his [[totalitarian]] rule until his death in 1953.\n\n==Soviet state's development==\n\n===Industrialization in practice===\n{{main|Industrialization in the Soviet Union}}\nThe mobilization of resources by state planning expanded the country's industrial base. From 1928 to 1932, pig iron output, necessary for further development of the industrial infrastructure rose from 3.3 million to 6.2 million tons per year. Coal production, a basic fuel of modern economies and Stalinist [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], rose from 35.4 million to 64 million tons, and the output of iron ore rose from 5.7 million to 19 million tons.  A number of industrial complexes such as [[Magnitogorsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk|Kuznetsk]], the Moscow and [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] automobile plants, the [[Ural Mountains]] and Kramatorsk heavy [[machinery]] plants, and Kharkiv, [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and [[Chelyabinsk]] tractor plants had been built or were under construction.<ref>Martin Mccauley, ''The Soviet Union 1917\u20131991'' (Routledge, 2014). p. 81.</ref>\n\nIn real terms, the workers' standards of living tended to drop, rather than rise during industrialization. Stalin's laws to \"tighten work discipline\" made the situation worse: e.g., a 1932 change to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] labor law code enabled firing workers who had been absent without a reason from the workplace for just one day. Being fired accordingly meant losing \"the right to use ration and commodity cards\" as well as the \"loss of the right to use an apartment\u2033 and even blacklisted for new employment which altogether meant a threat of starving.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/trud-uvol32-e.html | title= On Firing for Unexcused Absenteeism | publisher=Cyber USSR | accessdate= 2010-08-01}}</ref> Those measures, however, were not fully enforced, as managers were hard-pressed to replace these workers.  In contrast, the 1938 legislation, which introduced labor books, followed by major revisions of the labor law, was enforced. For example, being absent or even 20 minutes late were grounds for becoming fired; managers who failed to enforce these laws faced criminal prosecution. Later, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, 26 June 1940 \"On the Transfer to the Eight-Hour Working Day, the Seven-day Work Week, and on the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk-trud-e.html | title=On the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices | publisher = Cyber USSR | accessdate= 2010-08-01}}</ref> replaced the 1938 revisions with obligatory criminal penalties for quitting a job (2\u20134 months imprisonment), for being late 20 minutes (6 months of probation and pay confiscation of 25 per cent), etc.\n\nBased on these figures, the Soviet government declared that the Five Year Industrial Production Plan had been fulfilled by 93.7% in only four years, while parts devoted to the heavy-industry parts were fulfilled by 108%. Stalin in December 1932 declared the plan success to the Central Committee since increases in the output of coal and iron would fuel future development.<ref>, Martin Mccauley, ''Stalin and Stalinism'' (3rd ed. 2013) p. 39.</ref>\n\nDuring the second five-year plan (1933\u201337), on the basis of the huge investment during the first plan, the industry expanded extremely rapidly and nearly reached the plan's targets. By 1937, coal output was 127 million tons, pig iron 14.5 million tons, and there had been very rapid development of the armaments industry.<ref>E. A. Rees, ''Decision-making in the Stalinist Command Economy, 1932\u201337'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1997)  212\u201313.</ref>\n\nWhile making a massive leap in industrial capacity, the First Five Year Plan was extremely harsh on industrial workers; quotas were difficult to fulfill, requiring that miners put in 16- to 18-hour workdays.<ref>, Andrew B.

Due to the allocation of resources for the industry along with decreasing productivity since collectivization, a famine occurred. In the construction of the industrial complexes, inmates of [[Gulag]] camps were used as expendable resources. But conditions improved rapidly during the second plan. Throughout the 1930s, industrialization was combined with a rapid expansion of technical and engineering education as well as increasing emphasis on munitions.<ref>Mark Harrison and Robert W.

The estimated numbers vary greatly. Perhaps, 3.7 million people were sentenced for alleged counter-revolutionary crimes, including 600,000 sentenced to death, 2.4 million sentenced to labor camps, and 700,000 sentenced to [[Expatriate|expatriation]]. Stalinist repression reached its peak during the Great Purge of 1937\u201338, which removed many skilled managers and experts and considerably slowed industrial production in 1937<ref>Vadim Birstein ''Smersh: Stalin's Secret Weapon'' (Biteback Publishing, 2013) pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n===Collectivization of agriculture===\n{{Main|Collectivisation in the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:McCormick-Deering 15-30 The First Tractor Propaganda Shot.jpg|thumb|Propaganda shows the use of tractors (in this case McCormick-Deering 15-30) as a backbone of collectivization. [[Soviet Ukraine]], 1931]]\nUnder the NEP, Lenin had to tolerate the continued existence of privately owned agriculture. He decided to wait at least 20 years before attempting to place it under state control and in the meantime concentrate on industrial development. However, after Stalin's rise to power, the timetable for collectivization was shortened to just five years. Demand for food intensified, especially in the USSR's primary grain producing regions, [[Ural-Siberian method|with new, forced approaches implemented]]. Upon joining [[kolkhoz]]es (collective farms), peasants had to give up their private plots of land and property. Every harvest, Kolkhoz production was sold to the state for a low price set by the state itself. However, the natural progress of collectivization was slow, and the November 1929 Plenum of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] decided to accelerate collectivization through force. In any case, Russian peasant culture formed a bulwark of traditionalism that stood in the way of the Soviet state's goals.\n\nGiven the goals of the first Five Year Plan, the state sought increased political control of agriculture in order to feed the rapidly growing urban population and to obtain a source of foreign currency through increased cereal exports. Given its late start, the USSR needed to import a substantial number of the expensive technologies necessary for heavy industrialization.\n\nBy 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture had been collectivized. In many cases, peasants bitterly opposed this process and often slaughtered their animals rather than give them to collective farms, even though the government only wanted the grain. [[Kulak]]s, prosperous peasants, were forcibly resettled to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], Siberia and the Russian Far North (a large portion of the kulaks served at forced labor camps). However, just about anyone opposing collectivization was deemed a \"kulak\".  The policy of liquidation of kulaks as a class\u2014formulated by Stalin at the end of 1929\u2014meant some executions, and even more deportation to special settlements and, sometimes, to forced labor camps.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hudson|first=Hugh D.|chapter=Liquidation of Kulak Influence, War Panic, and the Elimination of the Kulaks as a Class, 1927\u20131929|date=2012|work=Peasants, Political Police, and the Early Soviet State: Surveillance and Accommodation under the New Economic Policy|pages=89\u2013111|editor-last=Hudson|editor-first=Hugh D.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137010544_6|isbn=9781137010544|title=Peasants, Political Police, and the Early Soviet State}}</ref>\n\nDespite the expectations, collectivization led to a catastrophic drop in farm productivity, which did not return to the levels achieved under the NEP until 1940. The upheaval associated with collectivization was particularly severe in Ukraine and the heavily Ukrainian Volga region. Peasants slaughtered their livestock en masse rather than give them up. In 1930 alone, 25% of the nation's cattle, sheep, and goats, and one-third of all pigs were killed. It was not until the 1980s that the Soviet livestock numbers would return to their 1928 level. Government bureaucrats, who had been given a rudimentary education on farming techniques, were dispatched to the countryside to \"teach\" peasants the new ways of socialist agriculture, relying largely on Marxist theoretical ideas that had little basis in reality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/famine-and-oppression/|title=Famine and Oppression {{!}} History of Western Civilization II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> Even after the state inevitably won and succeeding in imposing collectivization, the peasants did everything they could in the way of sabotage. They cultivated far smaller portions of their land and worked much less. The scale of the Ukrainian famine has led many Ukrainian scholars to argue that there was a deliberate policy of [[Holodomor|genocide against the Ukrainian people]]. Other scholars argue that the massive death totals were an inevitable result of a very poorly planned operation against all peasants, who had given little support to Lenin or Stalin. \n{{Quote|text=Almost 99% of all cultivated land had been pulled into collective farms by the end of 1937.

The collectivization of their farms began in 1948. Using terror, mass killings and deportations, most of the peasantry was collectivized by 1952.

By 1937, the number rose yet again, to about 7.9 million. Finally, in 1940 it reached 8.3 million. Between 1926 and 1930, the urban population increased by 30 million. Unemployment had been a problem in late Imperial Russia and even under the NEP, but it ceased being a major factor after the implementation of Stalin's massive industrialization program. The sharp mobilization of resources used in order to industrialize the heretofore agrarian society created a massive need for labor; unemployment virtually dropped to zero. Wage setting by Soviet planners also contributed to the sharp decrease in unemployment, which dropped in real terms by 50% from 1928 to 1940. With wages artificially depressed, the state could afford to employ far more workers than would be financially viable in a market economy. Several ambitious extraction projects were begun that endeavored to supply raw materials for both military hardware and consumer goods.\n\nThe Moscow and [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] automobile plants produced automobiles for the public\u2014despite few Soviet citizens affording to buy a car\u2014and the expansion of steel production and other industrial materials made the manufacture of a greater number of cars possible. Car and truck production, for example, reached 200,000 in 1931.{{Sfn | Tucker | 1990 | p = 96}}\n\n==Society==\n===Propaganda===\nMost of the top communist leaders in the 1920s and 1930s had been propagandists or editors before 1917, and were keenly aware of the importance of propaganda. As soon as they gained power in 1917 they seized the monopoly of all communication media, and greatly expanded their propaganda apparatus in terms of newspapers, magazines and pamphlets. Radio became a powerful tool in the 1930s.  <ref>David Brandenberger, ''Propaganda state in crisis: Soviet ideology, indoctrination, and terror under Stalin, 1927-1941'' (2012).</ref> Stalin, for example, has been an editor of ''Pravda''. Besides the national newspapers \"PRAVDA\" and ''Izvestia,'' there were numerous regional publications as well as newspapers and magazines and all the important languages. Ironclad uniformity of opinion was the norm during the Soviet era. Typewriters and printing presses were closely controlled into the 1980s to prevent unauthorized publications. [[Samizdat]] illegal circulation of subversive fiction and nonfiction was brutally suppressed. The rare exceptions to 100% uniformity in the official media were indicators of high-level battles.  The Soviet draft constitution of 1936 was an instance. ''Pravda'' and ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' (the paper for manual workers) praised the draft constitution. However ''Izvestiia'' was controlled by [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and it published negative letters and reports. Bukharin won out and the party line changed and started to attack \"Trotskyite\" oppositionists and traitors. Bukharin's success was short-lived; he was arrested in 1937, given a show trial and executed.<ref>Ellen Wimberg, \"Socialism, democratism and criticism: The Soviet press and the national discussion of the 1936 draft constitution.\" ''Europe\u2010Asia Studies'' 44#2 (1992): 313-332. </ref>\n\n===Education===\nFor propaganda to be effective it had to reach the entire population, yet the great majority of peasants were illiterate. The success of communism depended on their becoming literate. Industrial workers needed to be educated in order to be competitive and so embarked on a program contemporaneous with industrialization to greatly increase the number of schools and the general quality of education.  In 1927, 7.9 million students attended 118,558 schools. By 1933, the number rose to 9.7 million students in 166,275 schools. In addition, 900 specialist departments and 566 institutions were built and fully operational by 1933. Literacy rates increased substantially as a result, especially in the Central Asian republics.{{Sfn | Tucker | 1990 | p = 228}}<ref>Boris N.  Mironov,  \u201cThe Development of Literacy in Russia and the USSR from the Tenth to the Twentieth Centuries.\u201d ''History of Education Quarterly'' 31#2 (1991), pp. 229\u2013252. [www.jstor.org/stable/368437  Online]</ref>\n\n===Women===\nThe Soviet people also benefited from a type of social liberalization. Women were to be given the same education as men and, at least legally speaking, obtained the same rights as men in the workplace. Although in practice these goals were not reached, the efforts to achieve them and the statement of theoretical equality led to a general improvement in the socio-economic status of women. \n===Health===\nStalinist development also contributed to advances in health care, which marked a massive improvement over the Imperial era.  Stalin's policies granted the Soviet people access to free health care and education.  Widespread immunization programs created the first generation free from the fear of typhus and cholera.  The occurrences of these diseases dropped to record-low numbers and infant mortality rates were substantially reduced, resulting in the [[life expectancy]] for both men and women to increase by over 20 years by the mid-to-late 1950s.<ref name = \"rand\">{{Citation | editor1-first = Julie | editor1-last = Da Vanzo | editor2-first = Gwen | editor2-last = Farnsworth | url = https://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF124/ | title = Russia's Demographic \"Crisis\" | pages =115\u201321 | year = 1996 | publisher = [[RAND]] | isbn = 978-0-8330-2446-6}}.</ref> \n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Komsomol poster 1933.jpg|thumb|left|225px|1933 Komsomol poster.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42867730 online]</ref> The Komsomol played an important role as a mechanism for teaching Party values to the younger generation. The Komsomol also served as a mobile pool of labor and political activism, with the ability to relocate to areas of high-priority at short notice. In the 1920s the Kremlin assigned Komsomol major responsibilities for promoting industrialization at the factory level. In 1929 7,000 Komsomol cadets were building the tractor factory in Stalingrad, 56,000 others built factories in the Urals, and 36,000 were assigned work underground in the coal mines. The goal was to provide an energetic hard-core of Bolshevik activists to influence their coworkers the factories and mines that were at the center of communist ideology.<ref> Hannah Dalton, ''Tsarist and Communist Russia, 1855\u20131964 ''  (2015) p 132. </ref><ref>Hilary Pilkington, ''Russia's Youth and its Culture: A Nation's Constructors and Constructed'' (1995) pp 57-60.</ref>\n\nKomsomol adopted meritocratic, supposedly class-blind membership policies in 1935, but the result was a decline in working class youth members, and a dominance by the better educated youth. A new social hierarchy emerged as young professionals and students joined the Soviet elite, displacing proletarians.  Komsomol's membership policies in the 1930s reflected the broader nature of Stalinism, combining Leninist rhetoric about class-free progress with Stalinist pragmatism focused on getting the most enthusiastic and skilled membership.<ref>Seth Bernstein, \"Class Dismissed? New Elites and Old Enemies among the \u201cBest\u201d Socialist Youth in the Komsomol, 1934\u201341.\" ''Russian Review'' 74.1 (2015): 97-116.</ref>\n\n===Modernity===\nUrban women under Stalin, paralleling the modernization of western countries, were also the first generation of women able to give birth in a hospital with access to prenatal care.  Education was another area in which there was improvement after economic development, also paralleling other western countries.  The generation born during Stalin's rule was the first near-universally literate generation. Some engineers were sent abroad to learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on contract. Transport links were also improved, as many new railways were built, although with forced labour, costing thousands of lives. Workers who exceeded their quotas, ''[[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovite]]s'', received many incentives for their work, although many such workers were in fact \"arranged\" to succeed by receiving extreme help in their work, and then their achievements were used for propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheila Fitzpatrick|title=Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times : Soviet Russia in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3M8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|year=2000|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=8\u201310|isbn=9780195050011}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Further|Religion in the Soviet Union}}\nThe systematic attacks on the Russian Orthodox church began as soon as the Bolsheviks took power in 1917.

Historian Dimitry Pospielovski has estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 Orthodox clergy died by execution or in prison 1918-1929, plus an additional 45,000 in 1930-1939.

In 1937, [[Pope Pius XI]] decried the attacks on religion in the Soviet Union. By 1940, only a small number of churches remained open. The early anti-religious campaigns under Lenin were mostly directed at the Russian Orthodox Church, as it was a symbol of the czarist government. In the 1930s however, all faiths were targeted: minority Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  In the long run atheism failed to win many souls. Religion strengthened underground and was revived to help fight the Second World War. It flourished after the fall of Communism in the 1990's. As Paul Froese explains:\n:Atheists waged a 70-year war on religious belief in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques, and temples; it executed religious leaders; it flooded the schools and media with anti-religious propaganda; and it introduced a belief system called \u201cscientific atheism,\u201d complete with atheist rituals, proselytizers, and a promise of worldly salvation. But in the end, a majority of older Soviet citizens retained their religious beliefs and a crop of citizens too young to have experienced pre-Soviet times acquired religious beliefs.<ref>Paul Froese, Paul. \"Forced secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an atheistic monopoly failed.\" ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 43.1 (2004): 35-50.

In 1936\u201338, about three quarters of a million Soviets were executed, and more than a million others were sentenced to lengthy terms in very harsh labour camps. Stalin's Great Terror ravaged the ranks of factory directors and engineers, and removed most of the senior officers in the Army.<ref>James Harris, ''The Great Fear: Stalin\u2019s Terror of the 1930s'' (2017), p. 1 [https://www.amazon.com/Great-Fear-Stalins-Terror-1930s/dp/0199695768 excerpt]</ref> The pretext was the 1934 assassination of [[Sergey Kirov]] (which many suspect Stalin of having planned, although there is no evidence for this).<ref>Matt Lenoe,  \"Did Stalin Kill Kirov and Does It Matter?.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 74.2 (2002): 352-380.

Trotsky was expelled from the party in 1927, exiled to Kazakhstan in 1928, expelled from the USSR in 1929, and assassinated in 1940. Stalin used the purges to politically and physically destroy his other formal rivals (and former allies) accusing [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] of being behind Kirov's assassination and planning to overthrow Stalin. Ultimately, the people arrested were tortured and forced to confess to being spies and saboteurs, and quickly convicted and executed.<ref>James Harris, ''The Anatomy of Terror: Political Violence under Stalin'' (2013)</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Moscow Trials|show trial]]s were held in Moscow, to serve as examples for the trials that local courts were expected to carry out elsewhere in the country. There were four key trials from 1936 to 1938, The Trial of the Sixteen was the first (December 1936); then the Trial of the Seventeen (January 1937); then the trial of [[Red Army]] generals, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Marshal Tukhachevsky]] (June 1937); and finally the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites\"|Trial of the Twenty One]] (including [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|Bukharin]]) in March 1938. During these, the defendants typically confessed to sabotage, spying, counter-revolution, and conspiring with Germany and Japan to invade and partition the Soviet Union. The initial trials in 1935\u201336 were carried out by the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] under [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. In turn the prosecutors were tried and executed. The secret police were renamed the [[NKVD]] and control given to [[Nikolai Yezhov]], known as the \"Bloody Dwarf\".<ref> Arkadi\u012d Vaksberg and Jan Butler, ''The Prosecutor and the Prey: Vyshinsky and the 1930s' Moscow Show Trials'' (1990).</ref>\n\nThe \"Great Purge\" swept the Soviet Union in 1937. It was widely known as the \"Yezhovschina\", the \"Reign of Yezhov\". The rate of arrests was staggering. In the armed forces alone, 34,000 officers were purged including many at the higher ranks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Roberts|title=Stalin's General: The Life of Georgy Zhukov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOxRrfalHJcC&pg=PT58|year=2012|publisher=Icon Books|pages=58\u201359|isbn=9781848314436}}</ref>   The entire Politburo and most of the Central Committee were purged, along with foreign communists who were living in the Soviet Union, and numerous intellectuals, bureaucrats, and factory managers.

Yezhov was gradually relieved of power. Yezhov was relieved of all powers in 1939, then tried and executed in 1940. His successor as head of the NKVD (from 1938 to 1945) was [[Lavrentiy Beria]], a Georgian friend of Stalin's. Arrests and executions continued into 1952, although nothing on the scale of the Yezhovschina ever happened again.\n\nDuring this period, the practice of mass arrest, torture, and imprisonment or execution without trial, of anyone suspected by the secret police of opposing Stalin's regime became commonplace. By the NKVD's own count, 681,692 people were shot during 1937\u201338 alone, and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners were transported to Gulag work camps.<ref>{{cite book|author= Gregory|title=Terror by Quota: State Security from Lenin to Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DH57dXl_agC&pg=PA16|year=2009|page=16|isbn=978-0300152784}}</ref>\nThe mass terror and purges were little known to the outside world, and some western intellectuals and fellow travellers continued to believe that the Soviets had created a successful alternative to a capitalist world . In 1936, the country adopted its [[1936 Soviet Constitution|first formal constitution]], which only on paper granted freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.\n\nIn March 1939, the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th congress of the Communist Party]] was held in Moscow. Most of the delegates present at the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|17th congress]] in 1934 were gone, and Stalin was heavily praised by Litvinov and the western democracies criticized for failing to adopt the principles of \"collective security\" against Nazi Germany.\n\n===Interpreting the purges===\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that:  Stalin and other top leaders, using Marxist notions that they were always surrounded by enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army. It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276. </ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79. </ref>  Historians often cite the disruption as factors in its disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

Foreign investors did not receive any monetary or material compensation. The USSR also refused to pay tsarist-era debts to foreign debtors. The young Soviet polity was a pariah because of its openly stated goal of supporting the overthrow of capitalistic governments. It sponsored workers' revolts to overthrow numerous capitalistic European states, but they all failed. Lenin reversed radical experiments and restored a sort of capitalism with NEC. The Comintern was ordered to stop organizing revolts. Starting in 1921 Lenin sought trade, loans and recognition. One by one, foreign states reopened trade lines and recognized the Soviet government. The United States was the last major polity to recognise the USSR in 1933. In 1934, the French government proposed an alliance and led 30 governments to invite the USSR to join the League of Nations. The USSR had achieved legitimacy but was expelled in December 1939 for aggression against Finland.<ref>George F. Kennan, ''Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin'' (1961) pp 172-259.</ref><ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974'' (1974) pp 336-54.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Stalin pushed a leftist policy based on his belief in an imminent great crisis for capitalism. Various European communist parties were ordered not to form coalitions and instead to denounce moderate socialists as fascists. Activists were sent into labour unions to take control away from socialists\u2013a move the British unions never forgave. By 1930, the Stalinists started suggesting the value of alliance with other parties, and by 1934 the idea to form a [[Popular Front]] had emerged. Comintern agent [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]] was especially effective in organizing intellectuals, antiwar and pacifist elements to join the anti-Nazi coalition.<ref>Sean McMeekin, ''The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, Moscow\u2019s Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West'' (2003) pp 115-16, 194.</ref> Communists would form coalitions with any party to fight fascism.

While the Soviet Union was interested in conquering territories in Eastern Europe, France was determined to protect the fledgling states there. However, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign policy centered on a massive seizure of Central European, Eastern European, and Russian lands for Germany's own ends, and when Hitler pulled out of the [[World Disarmament Conference]] in Geneva in 1933, the threat hit home. Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] reversed Soviet policy regarding the Paris Peace Settlement, leading to a Franco-Soviet rapprochement. In May 1935, the USSR concluded pacts of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. Stalin-ordered the [[Communist International|Comintern]] to form a [[Popular Front (France)|popular front]] with leftist and centrist parties against the forces of [[Fascism]]. The pact was undermined, however, by strong ideological hostility to the Soviet Union and the Comintern's new front in France, Poland's refusal to permit the [[Red Army]] on its soil, France's defensive military strategy, and a continuing Soviet interest in patching up relations with Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Soviet Union supplied military aid to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] in the [[Second Spanish Republic]], including munitions and soldiers, and helped far-left activists come to Spain as volunteers. The Spanish government let the USSR have the government treasury. Soviet units systematically liquidated anarchist supporters of the Spanish government. Moscow's support of the government gave the Republicans a Communist taint in the eyes of anti-Bolsheviks in Britain and France, weakening the calls for Anglo-French intervention in the war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCannon\n|first=John|date=1995|title=Soviet Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, 1936\u201339: A Reexamination|journal=Russian History|volume=22|issue=2|pages=154\u2013180|issn=0094-288X|jstor=24657802|doi=10.1163/187633195X00070}}</ref>\n\nNazi Germany promulgated an [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Imperialist Japan and Fascist Italy, along with various Central and Eastern European states (such as [[Hungary between the World Wars|Hungary]]), ostensibly to suppress Communist activity but more realistically to forge an alliance against the USSR.<ref>Lorna L.

A secret appendix to the pact gave Eastern Poland, Latvia, Estonia, [[Bessarabia]] and Finland to the USSR, and Western Poland and [[Lithuania]] to Nazi Germany. This reflected the Soviet desire of territorial gains.\n\nFollowing the pact with Hitler, Stalin in 1939-40 annexed half of Poland, the three Baltic States, and Northern  Bukovina and Bessarabia in Romania. They no longer were buffers separating the USSR from German areas, argues Louis Fischer. Rather they facilitated Hitler's rapid advance to the gates of Moscow.<ref>  Louis Fischer, ''Russia's Road from Peace to War: Soviet Foreign Relations, 1917- 1941'' (1969). </ref>\n\nPropaganda was also considered an important foreign relations tool. International exhibitions, the distribution of media such as films, e.g.: ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevski]]'', as well as inviting prominent foreign individuals to tour the Soviet Union, were used as a method of gaining international influence and encouraging fellow travelers and pacifists to build popular fronts. <ref>Frederick C.

Helsinki, backed by world public opinion refused, so Stalin invaded.  Despite outnumbering Finnish troops by over 2.5:1, the war proved embarrassingly difficult for the Red Army, which was ill-equipped for the winter weather and lacking competent commanders since the [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|purge of the Soviet high command]]. The Finns resisted fiercely, and received some support and considerable sympathy from the Allies. A new threat in March 1940 led Finland to ask an armistice.

Stalin had made no preparations. Soviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation and the invasion caught the Soviet military unprepared.  In the larger sense, Stalin expected invasion but not so soon.<ref name=Murphy>{{Citation | first = David E | last = Murphy | title = What Stalin Knew: the enigma of Barbarossa | year = 2005 }}.</ref> The Army had been decimated by the Purges; time was needed for a recovery of competence. As such, mobilization did not occur and the Soviet Army was tactically unprepared as of the invasion. The initial weeks of the war were a disaster, with tens of thousands of men being killed, wounded, or captured. Whole divisions disintegrated against the German onslaught.\n\nGerman troops reached the outskirts of Moscow in December 1941, but failed to capture it, due to staunch Soviet defence and counterattacks. At the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942\u201343, the Red Army inflicted a crushing defeat on the German army.  Due to the unwillingness of the Japanese to open a second front in [[Manchuria]], the Soviets were able to call dozens of Red Army divisions back from eastern Russia. These units were instrumental in turning the tide, because most of their officer corps had escaped Stalin's purges. The Soviet forces soon launched massive counterattacks along the entire German line. By 1944, the Germans had been pushed out of the Soviet Union onto the banks of the [[Vistula]] river, just east of Prussia. With Soviet Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] attacking from Prussia, and Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] slicing Germany in half from the south, the fate of [[Nazi Germany]] was sealed. On May 2, 1945 the last German troops surrendered to the overjoyed Soviet troops in Berlin.\n\n===Wartime developments===\n{{further|Home front during World War II#Soviet Union}}\nFrom the end of 1944 to 1949, large sections of eastern Germany came under the Soviet Union's occupation and on 2 May 1945, the capital city Berlin was taken, while over fifteen million Germans were removed from eastern Germany and pushed into central Germany (later called the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]) and western Germany (later called the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]). Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, Czech, etc., were then moved onto German land.\n\nAn atmosphere of [[Soviet socialist patriotism|patriotic emergency]] took over the Soviet Union during the war, and persecution of the Orthodox Church was halted. The Church was now permitted to operate with a fair degree of freedom, so long as it did not get involved in politics. In 1944, a [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union|new Soviet national anthem]] was written, replacing [[the Internationale]], which had been used as the national anthem since 1918. These changes were made because it was thought that the people would respond better to a fight for their country than for a political ideology.\n\nThe Soviets bore the brunt of World War II because the West did not open up a second ground front in Europe until the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]. Approximately 26.6 million Soviets, among them 18 million civilians, were killed in the war. Civilians were rounded up and burned or shot in many cities conquered by the Nazis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The retreating Soviet army was ordered to pursue a '[[scorched earth]]' policy whereby retreating Soviet troops were ordered to destroy civilian infrastructure and food supplies so that the Nazi German troops could not use them.\n\nStalin's original declaration in March 1946 that there were 7 million war dead was revised in 1956 by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] with a round number of 20 million. In the late 1980s, demographers in the State Statistics Committee ([[Russian Federal State Statistics Service|Goskomstat]]) took another look using demographic methods and came up with an estimate of 26\u201327 million. A variety of other estimates have been made.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Michael | last1 = Ellman | first2 = S | last2 = Maksudov | title = Soviet Deaths in the Great Patriotic War: A Note | journal = [[Europe-Asia Studies]] | volume = 46 | number = 4 | year = 1994 | pages = 671\u201380 | doi=10.1080/09668139408412190 | pmid=12288331}}.</ref> In most detailed estimates roughly two-thirds of the estimated deaths were civilian losses. However, the breakdown of war losses by nationality is less well known. One study, relying on indirect evidence from the 1959 population census, found that while in terms of the aggregate human losses the major Slavic groups suffered most, the largest losses relative to population size were incurred by minority nationalities mainly from European Russia, among groups from which men were mustered to the front in \"nationality battalions\" and appear to have suffered disproportionately.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Barbara A | last1 = Anderson | first2 = Brian D | last2 = Silver | contribution = Demographic Consequences of World War II on the Non-Russian Nationalities of the USSR | editor-first = Susan J | editor-last = Linz | title = The Impact of World War II on the Soviet Union | place = Totowa, [[New Jersey|NJ]] | publisher = Rowman & Allanheld | year = 1985}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Union [[Soviet sphere of influence|occupied and dominated Eastern Europe]], in line with [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|their particular Marxist ideology]].\n\nStalin was determined to punish those peoples he saw as [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborating with Germany]] during the war and to deal with the problem of [[nationalism]], which would tend to pull the Soviet Union apart. Millions of Poles, Latvians, Georgians, Ukrainians and other ethnic minorities were deported to Gulags in Siberia. (Previously, following [[Soviet invasion of Poland|the 1939 annexation of eastern Poland]], thousands of Polish Army officers, including reservists, had been executed in the spring of 1940, in what came to be known as the [[Katyn massacre]].) In addition, in 1941, 1943 and 1944 several whole nationalities had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, including, among others, the [[Volga Germans]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Balkars]], [[Crimean Tatars]], and [[Meskhetian Turks]].

I drink, before all, to the health of the Russian people, because in this war they earned general recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the nationalities of our country...

The Soviet Union was especially devastated due to the mass destruction of the industrial base that it had built up in the 1930s. The USSR also experienced a major [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|famine]] in 1946\u201348 due to war devastation that cost an estimated 1 to 1.5 million lives as well as secondary population losses due to reduced fertility.{{Efn | Although the 1946 drought was severe, government mismanagement of its grain reserves largely accounted for the population losses.<ref>{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Ellman | title = The 1947 Soviet Famine and the Entitlement Approach to Famines | journal = Cambridge Journal of Economics | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | year = 2000 | pages = 603\u201330 | doi=10.1093/cje/24.5.603}}.</ref>}}  However, the Soviet Union recovered its production capabilities and overcame pre-war capabilities, becoming the country with the most powerful land army in history by the end of the war, and having the most powerful military production capabilities.\n\n====War and Stalinist industrial-military development====\nAlthough the Soviet Union received aid and weapons from the United States under the [[Lend-Lease]] program, the Soviet production of war materials was greater than that of Nazi Germany because of rapid growth of Soviet industrial production during the interwar years (additional supplies from lend-lease accounted for about 10\u201312% of the Soviet Union's own industrial output). The Second Five Year Plan raised [[steel]] production to 18 million tons and [[coal]] to 128 million tons. Before it was interrupted, the Third Five Year Plan produced no less than 19 million tons of steel and 150 million tons of coal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/library/special-collections-archives/first-five-year-plan|title=The First Five Year Plan, 1928-1932|date=2015-10-07|website=Special Collections & Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union's industrial output provided an armaments industry which supported their army, helping it resist the Nazi military offensive.  According to Robert L. Hutchings, \"One can hardly doubt that if there had been a slower buildup of industry, the attack would have been successful and world history would have evolved quite differently.\"<ref>Russia and the USSR, 1855\u20131991: Autocracy and Dictatorship p.147</ref> For the laborers involved in industry, however, life was difficult. Workers were encouraged to fulfill and overachieve quotas through [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda]], such as the [[Stakhanovite movement]].\n\nSome historians, however, interpret the lack of preparedness of the Soviet Union to defend itself as a flaw in Stalin's economic planning.  David Shearer, for example, argues that there was \"a command-administrative economy\" but it was not \"a planned one\". He argues that the Soviet Union was still suffering from the Great Purge, and was completely unprepared for the German invasion. Economist Holland Hunter, in addition, argues in his ''Overambitious First Soviet Five-Year Plan'', that an array \"of alternative paths were available, evolving out of the situation existing at the end of the 1920s... that could have been as good as those achieved by, say, 1936 yet with far less turbulence, waste, destruction and sacrifice.\"\n\n==The Cold War==\n{{Main|Cold War}}\n\n===Soviet control over Eastern Europe===\n{{main|Soviet sphere of influence}}\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|right|250px|Soviet expansion, change of [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[eastern Europe]]an borders and creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] after World War II]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Soviet Union extended its political and military influence over [[Eastern Europe]], in a move that was seen by some as a continuation of the older policies of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some territories that had been lost by Soviet Russia in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (1918) were annexed by the Soviet Union after World War II: the [[Baltic states]] and eastern portions of interwar Poland. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] also gained the northern half of East Prussia ([[Kaliningrad Oblast]]) from Germany. The [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] gained [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] (as [[Zakarpattia Oblast]]) from [[Czechoslovakia]], and Ukrainian populated Northern [[Bukovina]] (as [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]) from [[Romania]]. Finally, by the late 1940s, pro-Soviet Communist Parties won the elections in five countries of Central and Eastern Europe (specifically [[1947 Polish legislative election|Poland]], [[1948 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|Czechoslovakia]], [[1947 Hungarian parliamentary election|Hungary]], [[1946 Romanian general election|Romania]] and [[1945 Bulgarian parliamentary election|Bulgaria]]) and subsequently became [[People's democracy (Marxism-Leninism)|People's Democracies]]. These elections are generally regarded as [[Rigged election|rigged]], and the Western powers recognized them as [[show elections]]. For the duration of the Cold War, the countries of Eastern Europe became Soviet [[satellite state]]s \u2014 they were \"independent\" nations, which were [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Communist State]]s whose [[General Secretary]] had to be approved by the [[Kremlin]], and so their governments usually kept their policy in line with the wishes of the Soviet Union, although nationalistic forces and pressures within the satellite states played a part in causing some deviation from strict Soviet rule.\n\n===Tenor of Soviet\u2013U.S. relations===\nThe USSR urgently needed munitions, food and fuel that was provided by the U.S. and also Britain, primarily through [[Lend Lease]]. The three power kept in regular contact, with Stalin trying to maintain a veil of secrecy over internal affairs.  Churchill and other top Soviets visited Moscow, as did Roosevelt's top aide [[Harry Hopkins]]. Stalin repeatedly requested that the United States and Britain open a second front on the European continent; but the Allied invasion did not occur until June 1944, more than two years later. In the meantime, the Russians suffered high casualties, and the Soviets faced the brunt of German strength. The Allies pointed out that their intensive air bombardment was a major factor that Stalin ignored. <ref>Herbert Feis, ''Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin: The War They Waged and the Peace They Sought'' (Princeton, NJ, 1957).</ref><ref> William H. McNeill, ''America, Britain, & Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941-1946'' (1953)</ref><ref>Jonathan Fenby, ''Alliance: The Inside Story of How Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill Won One War and Began Another'' (2007) </ref>\n\n==Domestic events==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe mild political liberalization that took place in the Soviet Union during the war quickly came to an end in 1945. The Orthodox Church was generally left unmolested after the war and was even allowed to print small amounts of religious literature, but persecution of minority religions was resumed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Stalin and the Communist Party were given full credit for the victory over Germany, and generals such as Zhukov were demoted to regional commands (Ukraine in his case). With the onset of the Cold War, anti-Western propaganda was stepped up, with the capitalist world depicted as a decadent place where crime, unemployment, and poverty were rampant.\n\n[[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Art and science were subjected to rigorous censorship]].  Where previously The All- Russian Union of Writers [[Union of Soviet Writers|(AUW)]] had attempted to publish apolitical writing, The [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (RAPP) insisted on the importance of politics in literary work, and published content which primarily embodied the [[Proletarian literature|hegemony of the working-class values in fiction]].  The RAPP launched a campaign against the AUW chairman [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. It resulted in the defeat of the AUW, and they were replaced by the All-Russian Union of Soviet Writers, which strictly adopted the literary style of socialist realism. Soviet biology studies were heavily influenced by the now-discredited biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]], who rejected the concept of [[Mendelian inheritance]] in favor of a form of [[Lamarckism]]. In physics, the [[theory of relativity]] was dismissed as \"bourgeois idealism\". Much of this censorship was the work of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], known as Stalin's \"ideological hatchet man\",{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} until his death from a heart attack in 1948. [[Stalin's cult of personality]] reached its height in the postwar period, with his picture displayed in every school, factory, and government office, yet he rarely appeared in public. Postwar reconstruction proceeded rapidly, but as the emphasis was all on heavy industry and energy, living standards remained low, especially outside of the major cities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn October 1952, the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|first postwar party congress]] convened in Moscow. Stalin did not feel up to delivering the main report and for most of the proceedings sat in silence while [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] delivered the main speeches. He did suggest however that the party be renamed from \"The All-Union Party of Bolsheviks\" to \"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union\" on the grounds that \"There was once a time when it was necessary to distinguish ourselves from the Mensheviks, but there are no Mensheviks anymore. We are the entire party now.\" Stalin also mentioned his advancing age (two months away from 73) and suggested that it might be time to retire. Predictably, no one at the congress would dare agree with it and the delegates instead pleaded for him to stay.\n\nTerror by the secret police continued in the postwar period. Although nothing comparable to 1937 ever happened again, there were many smaller purges, including a mass purge of the Georgian party apparatus in 1951\u201352. Stalin's health also deteriorated precipitously after WWII. He suffered a stroke in the fall of 1945 and was ill for months. This was followed by another stroke in 1947. Stalin became less active in the day to day running of the state and instead of party meetings, preferred to invite the Politburo members to all-night dinners where he would watch movies and force them to get drunk and embarrass themselves or say something incriminating.\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main|Korean War}}\nIn 1950, the Soviet Union protested against the fact that the Chinese seat at the [[United Nations Security Council]] was held by the [[Taiwan|Nationalist government of China]], and boycotted the meetings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} While the Soviet Union was absent, the UN passed a resolution condemning North Korean actions and offering military support to South Korea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} After this incident the Soviet Union was never absent at the meetings of the Security Council.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Bibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies]]\n* [[Cold War]]\n* [[Collective farming]]\n* [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin]]\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Economy of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Great Purge]]\n* [[Gulag]]\n* [[History of Russia]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Islam in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Joseph Stalin]]\n* [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\n* [[Red Army]]\n* [[Russia]]\n* [[Russian Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Secret police]]\n* [[Soviet art]]\n* [[Soviet calendar]]\n* [[Political repression in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Politics of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Soviet Union]]\n* [[Superpower]]\n* [[Timeline of Russian history]]\n* [[World War II]]\n* [[X Article]]}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[File:State Emblem of the Soviet Union.svg|thumb|right|200px|Endorsed by the Constitution of the USSR in 1924, the State Emblem of the Soviet Union (above) was a hammer and sickle symbolizing the alliance of the working class and the peasantry.

He was also fortunate in that an [[Indian Air Force]] [[forward air controller]] was able to secure and direct aircraft in support of the post's defence until reinforcements arrived six hours later.\n\nThe Pakistani commanders made several questionable decisions, including a failure of their [[strategic intelligence]] to foresee availability of Indian [[strike aircraft]] in the Longewala area, exercising [[operational mobility]] with little or no [[route reconnaissance]], and conducting a tactical [[frontal assault]] with no [[engineer reconnaissance]]{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. This led to the Pakistani [[brigade]] group being left extremely vulnerable to air attack, vehicles becoming bogged in terrain not suitable for the movement of armoured vehicles as they tried to deploy off a single track, these being more susceptible to enemy fire by using external fuel storage in [[military tactics|tactical combat]], attempting to execute a night attack over unfamiliar terrain, and infantry being surprised by [[obstacles to troop movement]] causing confusion and stalling the attack during the crucial hours of darkness, when the assaulting infantry still had a measure of concealment from Indian [[small arms]] and [[infantry support weapon]] fire.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe main thrust of the Indian Army during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 war]] was directed towards the eastern theatre, with the western sector envisaged as a holding operation to prevent the Pakistan Army from achieving any success that would allow the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Yahya Khan]], any bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. By the last week of November 1971, the Indian Army had launched offensive manoeuvres at [[Battle of Atgram|Atgram]] against Pakistani border posts and communications centres along the eastern border. The [[Mukti Bahini]] also launched an offensive on Jessore at this time.<ref name= LOC>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+pk0032)|title=Pakistan&nbsp;\u2014 Yahya Khan and Bangladesh|publisher= Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate = 6 April 2009|date=April 1994}}</ref> It was clear to  [[Islamabad]] by this time that open conflict was inevitable, and that East Pakistan was indefensible in the long run.<ref name= gs>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/KRG.htm |title = The India-Pakistan War Of 1971: A Modern War|author=Kyle, R.G. |date=14 March 1964|accessdate=6 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090418234716/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/KRG.htm| archivedate= 18 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Yahya Khan chose at this point to try to protect Pakistan's integrity and to hold India by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]'s strategy&nbsp;\u2013 ''\"The defence of East Pakistan lies in the West\"''.<ref name=Faruqui>''Failure in Command: Lessons from Pakistan's Indian Wars, 1947\u20131999.'' Faruqui A. Defense Analysis Vol.17, No. 1, 1 April 2001</ref>\n\n== Prelude ==\n=== The Western sector ===\n\nKhan's policy made the assumption that an open conflict with India would not last long due to [[UN|International pressure]], and that since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, [[Tikka Khan|Gen Tikka Khan]] had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's \"overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The initial plans for the offensive called for at least a temporary cover of [[air dominance]] by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into [[Western India]] before digging in and consolidating their positions. To support Khan's troops, the PAF had launched [[Operation Chengiz Khan|pre-emptive strikes]] on the evening of 3 December that led to the formal commencement of hostilities. In the western theatre, the town of [[Rahim Yar Khan]], close to the international border, formed a critical communication centre for Khan's forces and, situated on the Sindh&nbsp;\u2014 Punjab railway, remained a vulnerable link in Khan's logistics. The fall of Rahim Yar Khan to Indian forces would cut off the rail as well as road link between [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], starving Khan's forces of fuel and ammunition delivered to [[Karachi]].\n\nIndian battle plans called for a strike across the international border with the 12th Indian division towards Islamgarh through Sarkari Tala, subsequently advancing through Baghla to secure Rahim Yar Khan, which would not only destabilise the Pakistani defences in the Punjab, but also in the [[Jammu & Kashmir]] Sector, allowing the planned Indian offensive [[Battle of Basantar|in the Shakargarh sector]] to sweep the Pakistani forces trapped there.<ref name=Ludra>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010113/windows/main4.htm|title=An assessment of the battle of Longewala|first=K. S.|last=Thakur Ludra|publisher=The Tribune|location=India|date=13 January 2001|accessdate=6 April 2009|page=1}}</ref>\n\nPakistan, which envisaged the Punjab as an operational centre, had a strong intelligence network in the area and planned to counter its own comparatively weak strength on the ground with a pre-emptive strike through [[Kishangarh]] towards the divisional headquarters south of Ramgarh<ref name=Ludra/>. Pakistani intelligence was able to infiltrate the operations area posing as local people and pass on information. However, these sources failed to pass on information on the Longewala post which, originally a [[Border Security Force|BSF]] post, was now held by a company of the Punjab Regiment. Longewala formed a strategic point en route to capturing vast tracts of land and also a pivotal theatre of war in engaging India on the western front.\n\n=== Tactical plan ===\nPakistan's tactical plan was based on the assumption that an attack in the area would help Pakistan's 1st Armoured Divisions task in the [[Sri Ganganagar]] area. Pakistan High command also felt that it was important to protect the North-South road link which they felt was vulnerable as it was close to the border. A [[Combined Arms]] Plan was decided upon. This involved two Infantry Brigades and two Armoured Regiments. A separate division, the 18 Division, was formed for this purpose. 18 Division Operation Orders required one Infantry Brigade (206) with an Armoured Regiment (38 Cavalry) to capture and establish a firm base at Longewala, a junction on the Indian road system and 51st Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Cavalry ([[Pakistan Army Armoured Corps]]) to operate beyond Longewala to capture [[Jaisalmer]].<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/feb-mar99/letter.htm '''Correspondence from Lt. Col. (Retd) H.K. Afridi''' Defence Journal, Karachi. feb-mar99] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622082310/http://www.defencejournal.com/feb-mar99/letter.htm |date=22 June 2006 }} URL accessed on 22 September 2006</ref>\n\nThe Pakistani plan was to reach Longewala, Ramgarh and Jaisalmer. The plan was far-fetched from the start, if only because it called for a night attack to be conducted over terrain that was not preceded by route or engineer reconnaissance, and the armoured troops were therefore unaware of the ground surface that could not support rapid movement towards the objective. As the day unfolded, Longewala would stand out as one of the biggest losses in a battle for Pakistan despite overwhelming superiority before commencement of the battle, largely due to the vehicles becoming bogged down in soft sand.\n\n=== Indian defensive planning ===\nOn the Indian side, the post was held by A Company, 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, led by Maj. [[Kuldip Singh Chandpuri]], the defences occupying a high sand dune which dominated the area that was largely intractable to vehicles.<ref name=\"TI\" /> The post was surrounded by a [[barbed wire]] fence of three stands. The rest of the battalion was located at Sadhewala, 17&nbsp;km north-east of the Longewala post. Chandpuri commanded an infantry company reinforced by a section each of [[Medium machine gun|MMGs]] and [[L16 81mm mortar]], and one Jeep-mounted [[Recoilless rifle|RCL]]. His two other recoilless rifle teams of the anti-tank section were under training at the battalion headquarters. Major Chandpuri also had under his command a four-man team of the camel Border Security Force division.<ref name=SS>Shorey A. ''Sainik Samachar''. Vol.52, No.4, 16\u2013 28February  2005</ref> The Longewala post had no armoured vehicles, but artillery support was available from a battery of 170 Field Regiment (Veer Rajput) tasked in direct support to the battalion, and 168 Field Regiment which had been deployed to the area in secrecy just a day earlier. The direct support battery was attached to 168 Field Regiment and served as its \"Sierra\" Battery. Immediately after PAF strikes on Indian airfields on 3 December, Chandpuri dispatched a 20-man strong patrol under 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan to Boundary Pillar (BP) 638, on the international border. This patrol was to play an important part in detecting the advances of Pakistani forces.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:HAL Marut used in the battle of longewala.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the three [[HAL Marut]] used by the IAF against Pakistani armour at Longewala]]\nDuring the night of the 4th, 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's platoon, while on a patrol, detected noises across the border that suggested a large number of armoured vehicles approaching.<ref>p.177, Nayar</ref> These were soon confirmed by reports&nbsp;\u2014 from the Army's Air Observation Post aircraft flown by Maj. Atma Singh&nbsp;\u2014 in the area of a 20&nbsp;km long armoured column on the track leading to the post advancing in the general direction of the Longewala post.<ref>p.239, Rao</ref> Directing 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's patrol to trail the advancing armoured column, Chandpuri got in touch with battalion headquarters requesting urgent reinforcements and armour and artillery support. Battalion HQ gave him the choice of staying put, and containing the attack as much as possible, or carrying out a tactical retreat of the company to Ramgarh, as reinforcements would not be available for at least six hours. Considering that Chandpuri's command had no transportation, and was facing a mobile enemy, he decided to maintain the defensive position of the post where his troops at least had the benefit of prepared defensive works, rather than conducting a withdrawal at night that was a far riskier option.\n\nThe Pakistani forces began their attack at 12:30 am.<ref name=\"p.83, Imprint\">p.83, Imprint</ref> As the offensive approached the lone outpost, Pakistani artillery opened up across the border with medium artillery guns, killing five of the ten camels from the BSF detachment. As the column of 45 tanks neared the post, Indian defences, lacking the time to lay a prepared minefield, laid a hasty anti-tank minefield as the enemy advanced, one infantryman being killed in the process.<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Years-later-Longewala-reminds-the-do-or-die-battle/articleshow/27554710.cms</ref><ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\">p.42, Sharma</ref> The Indian infantry held their fire until the leading Pakistani tanks had approached to 15\u201330 metres before firing their [[PIAT]]s.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/> They accounted for the first two tanks on the track with their Jeep-mounted 106&nbsp;mm M40 recoilless rifle, with one of its crew being killed during the engagement.<ref>There is a suggestion that there were two RCL-armed Jeeps at the post</ref> This weapon proved quite effective because it was able to engage the thinner top armour of the Pakistani tanks from its elevated position, firing at often stationary, bogged down vehicles. In all, the post defenders claimed 12 tanks destroyed or damaged. The initial Pakistani attack stalled almost immediately when the infantry discovered the barbed wire which was unseen in the night, and interpreted it to signify a minefield. Firing for the Indian RCL crews was made easier by the flames of fires when the spare fuel tanks on the Pakistani tanks, intended to supplement their internal capacity for the advance to Jaisalmer, exploded, at once providing ample light for Indians located on higher ground, and creating a dense acrid [[smoke screen]] at ground level for the Pakistani infantry, adding to the confusion. Two hours were lost as Pakistani sappers were brought up, only to discover there was no minefield. However, at this time Pakistani infantry were required to make another attack, from a different direction, but in the dawn light. The Pakistani advance then attempted to surround the post two hours later by vehicles getting off the road, but many vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers and tanks, in trying to soften up the Indian defenders before attacking, became bogged down in the soft sand of the area surrounding the post. Throughout the engagement, Maj. Chandpuri continued to direct the supporting artillery fire.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/>\n\nAlthough massively outnumbering the Indian defenders, and having surrounded them, the Pakistani troops were unable to advance over open terrain on a full-moon night, under small arms and mortar fire from the outpost.<ref name=\"p.83, Imprint\"/> This encouraged the Indians not to give up their strong defensive position, frustrating the Pakistani commanders. As dawn arrived, the Pakistan forces had still not taken the post, and were now having to do so in full daylight.\n\nIn the morning, the Indian Air Force was finally able to direct some [[HAL HF-24 Marut]]s and [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft to assist the post; they were not outfitted with night vision equipment, and so were delayed from conducting combat missions until dawn.<ref>p.100, Nordeen</ref> With daylight, however, the IAF was able to operate effectively, with the strike aircraft being guided to the targets by the airborne [[Forward Air Controller]] (FAC) Maj. Atma Singh in a HAL Krishak.<ref>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Suresh.html An IAF pilot's account of the battle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205024625/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Suresh.html |date=5 December 2005 }}, Suresh</ref> The Indian aircraft attacked the Pakistani ground troops with the 16 [[Matra]] T-10 rockets and [[ADEN cannon|30 mm cannon]] fire on each aircraft. Without support from the Pakistan Air Force, which was busy elsewhere, the tanks and other armoured vehicles were easy targets for the IAF's Hunters. The range of the 12.7&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft [[heavy machine gun]]s mounted on the tanks was limited and therefore ineffective against the Indian jets. Indian air attacks were made easier by the nature of the barren terrain. Many IAF officers later described the attack as a 'turkey shoot' signifying the lopsidedness. By noon the next day, the assault ended completely, having cost Pakistan 22 tanks claimed destroyed by aircraft fire, 12 by ground anti-tank fire, and some captured after being abandoned, with a total of 100 vehicles claimed to have been destroyed or damaged in the desert around the post. The Pakistani attack was first halted, and then Pakistani forces were forced to withdraw when Indian tanks from the division's cavalry regiment, the [[20th Lancers (India)|20th Lancers]], commanded by Col. Bawa Guruvachan Singh, along with the 17th battalion, [[Rajputana Rifles]], launched their counter-offensive to end the six-hour engagement.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/> Longewala had proved to be one of the defining moments in the war.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle of Longewala saw heavy Pakistani losses and few Indian casualties. Since the Indians were able to use the defenders' advantage, they managed to inflict heavy losses on the Pakistanis. Indian casualties in the battle were two soldiers along with one of their jeep mounted recoilless rifles knocked out. Pakistani losses were 200 soldiers killed.<ref name=\"Francis\"/> The Pakistanis suffered the loss of 34 tanks destroyed or abandoned, and lost 500 additional vehicles.<ref name=Jaques /> The [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission|judicial commission]] set up at the end of war recommended the commander of 18 Division, Maj. Gen. Mustafa, to be tried for negligence during the war.<ref name=\"HRC Report\">{{Cite report|author=Hamoodur Rehman |authorlink=Hamoodur Rehman |author2=Sheikh Anwarul Haq |author3=Tufail Ali Abdul Rehman |title=Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report |url=http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |publisher=Government of Pakistan |pages=79\u201380 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011310/http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |archivedate= 4 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the Indian victory, there were intelligence and strategic failures on both sides. India's intelligence failed to provide warning of such a large armoured force in the western sector. Moreover, the defending post was not heavily armed to neutralise the enemy. Finally, they did not push home the advantage by destroying the fleeing Pakistani tanks while the IAF had them on the run. They did, however destroy or capture some 36 tanks,<ref name=JH /> remaining one of the largest disproportionate tank casualties for one side in a single battle after [[World War II]].\n\nInvading Pakistan troops meanwhile, had underestimated the Longewala post's defensive capability due to the difficulty of approach over sand, conducting the attack at night and in full-moon light, against stiff resistance encountered there from a well prepared defensive position located on a dominant height. Attacking with virtually no air cover, they took too long to close for an assault on the position, and failed to anticipate availability of Indian [[close air support]]. Given that Pakistan's [[Sherman tank]]s and T-59/Type 59 Chinese tanks were slow on the sandy Thar desert, some military analysts have opined that the attack may have been poorly planned and executed given the terrain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/army-orbat-corps-aor.htm|title=Pakistan Army Order of Battle&nbsp;\u2014 Corps Sectors|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> Some Pakistani tanks suffered engine failures due to overheating in trying to extricate themselves, and were abandoned. The open desert battleground provided little to no cover for the tanks and infantry from air attacks. The plan to capture Longewala may have been good in conception, but failed due to lack of air cover. As a result, two tank regiments failed to take Longewala.\n\n[[File:KuldipsinghchandpuriGujjar.jpg|x216px|right|thumb|Maj. Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, [[Maha Vir Chakra|MVC]].]]\n\nFor his part, the Indian company commander, Maj. (later Brig.) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, was decorated with India's second highest gallantry award, the [[Maha Vir Chakra]]. Several other awards were earned by members of the defending company, and the battalion's commander. On the other hand, the Pakistani divisional commander was dismissed from service. However, the commander of the Pakistani 51 Brigade who mounted the daring attack and crossed into Indian territory was later awarded Pakistan's high award of the [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]].\n\nBritish media reported the defence of Longewala.

He was also fortunate in that an [[Indian Air Force]] [[forward air controller]] was able to secure and direct aircraft in support of the post's defence until reinforcements arrived six hours later.\n\nThe Pakistani commanders made several questionable decisions, including a failure of their [[strategic intelligence]] to foresee availability of Indian [[strike aircraft]] in the Longewala area, exercising [[operational mobility]] with little or no [[route reconnaissance]], and conducting a tactical [[frontal assault]] with no [[engineer reconnaissance]]{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. This led to the Pakistani [[brigade]] group being left extremely vulnerable to air attack, vehicles becoming bogged in terrain not suitable for the movement of armoured vehicles as they tried to deploy off a single track, these being more susceptible to enemy fire by using external fuel storage in [[military tactics|tactical combat]], attempting to execute a night attack over unfamiliar terrain, and infantry being surprised by [[obstacles to troop movement]] causing confusion and stalling the attack during the crucial hours of darkness, when the assaulting infantry still had a measure of concealment from Indian [[small arms]] and [[infantry support weapon]] fire.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe main thrust of the Indian Army during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 war]] was directed towards the eastern theatre, with the western sector envisaged as a holding operation to prevent the Pakistan Army from achieving any success that would allow the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Yahya Khan]], any bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. By the last week of November 1971, the Indian Army had launched offensive manoeuvres at [[Battle of Atgram|Atgram]] against Pakistani border posts and communications centres along the eastern border. The [[Mukti Bahini]] also launched an offensive on Jessore at this time.<ref name= LOC>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+pk0032)|title=Pakistan&nbsp;\u2014 Yahya Khan and Bangladesh|publisher= Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate = 6 April 2009|date=April 1994}}</ref> It was clear to  [[Islamabad]] by this time that open conflict was inevitable, and that East Pakistan was indefensible in the long run.<ref name= gs>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/KRG.htm |title = The India-Pakistan War Of 1971: A Modern War|author=Kyle, R.G. |date=14 March 1964|accessdate=6 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090418234716/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/KRG.htm| archivedate= 18 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Yahya Khan chose at this point to try to protect Pakistan's integrity and to hold India by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]'s strategy&nbsp;\u2013 ''\"The defence of East Pakistan lies in the West\"''.<ref name=Faruqui>''Failure in Command: Lessons from Pakistan's Indian Wars, 1947\u20131999.''

Defense Analysis Vol.17, No. 1, 1 April 2001</ref>\n\n== Prelude ==\n=== The Western sector ===\n\nKhan's policy made the assumption that an open conflict with India would not last long due to [[UN|International pressure]], and that since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, [[Tikka Khan|Gen Tikka Khan]] had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's \"overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The initial plans for the offensive called for at least a temporary cover of [[air dominance]] by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into [[Western India]] before digging in and consolidating their positions. To support Khan's troops, the PAF had launched [[Operation Chengiz Khan|pre-emptive strikes]] on the evening of 3 December that led to the formal commencement of hostilities. In the western theatre, the town of [[Rahim Yar Khan]], close to the international border, formed a critical communication centre for Khan's forces and, situated on the Sindh&nbsp;\u2014 Punjab railway, remained a vulnerable link in Khan's logistics. The fall of Rahim Yar Khan to Indian forces would cut off the rail as well as road link between [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], starving Khan's forces of fuel and ammunition delivered to [[Karachi]].\n\nIndian battle plans called for a strike across the international border with the 12th Indian division towards Islamgarh through Sarkari Tala, subsequently advancing through Baghla to secure Rahim Yar Khan, which would not only destabilise the Pakistani defences in the Punjab, but also in the [[Jammu & Kashmir]] Sector, allowing the planned Indian offensive [[Battle of Basantar|in the Shakargarh sector]] to sweep the Pakistani forces trapped there.<ref name=Ludra>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010113/windows/main4.htm|title=An assessment of the battle of Longewala|first=K. S.|last=Thakur Ludra|publisher=The Tribune|location=India|date=13 January 2001|accessdate=6 April 2009|page=1}}</ref>\n\nPakistan, which envisaged the Punjab as an operational centre, had a strong intelligence network in the area and planned to counter its own comparatively weak strength on the ground with a pre-emptive strike through [[Kishangarh]] towards the divisional headquarters south of Ramgarh<ref name=Ludra/>. Pakistani intelligence was able to infiltrate the operations area posing as local people and pass on information. However, these sources failed to pass on information on the Longewala post which, originally a [[Border Security Force|BSF]] post, was now held by a company of the Punjab Regiment. Longewala formed a strategic point en route to capturing vast tracts of land and also a pivotal theatre of war in engaging India on the western front.\n\n=== Tactical plan ===\nPakistan's tactical plan was based on the assumption that an attack in the area would help Pakistan's 1st Armoured Divisions task in the [[Sri Ganganagar]] area. Pakistan High command also felt that it was important to protect the North-South road link which they felt was vulnerable as it was close to the border. A [[Combined Arms]] Plan was decided upon. This involved two Infantry Brigades and two Armoured Regiments. A separate division, the 18 Division, was formed for this purpose. 18 Division Operation Orders required one Infantry Brigade (206) with an Armoured Regiment (38 Cavalry) to capture and establish a firm base at Longewala, a junction on the Indian road system and 51st Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Cavalry ([[Pakistan Army Armoured Corps]]) to operate beyond Longewala to capture [[Jaisalmer]].<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/feb-mar99/letter.htm '''Correspondence from Lt.

The plan was far-fetched from the start, if only because it called for a night attack to be conducted over terrain that was not preceded by route or engineer reconnaissance, and the armoured troops were therefore unaware of the ground surface that could not support rapid movement towards the objective. As the day unfolded, Longewala would stand out as one of the biggest losses in a battle for Pakistan despite overwhelming superiority before commencement of the battle, largely due to the vehicles becoming bogged down in soft sand.\n\n=== Indian defensive planning ===\nOn the Indian side, the post was held by A Company, 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, led by Maj. [[Kuldip Singh Chandpuri]], the defences occupying a high sand dune which dominated the area that was largely intractable to vehicles.<ref name=\"TI\" /> The post was surrounded by a [[barbed wire]] fence of three stands. The rest of the battalion was located at Sadhewala, 17&nbsp;km north-east of the Longewala post. Chandpuri commanded an infantry company reinforced by a section each of [[Medium machine gun|MMGs]] and [[L16 81mm mortar]], and one Jeep-mounted [[Recoilless rifle|RCL]]. His two other recoilless rifle teams of the anti-tank section were under training at the battalion headquarters. Major Chandpuri also had under his command a four-man team of the camel Border Security Force division.<ref name=SS>Shorey A. ''Sainik Samachar''. Vol.52, No.4, 16\u2013 28February  2005</ref> The Longewala post had no armoured vehicles, but artillery support was available from a battery of 170 Field Regiment (Veer Rajput) tasked in direct support to the battalion, and 168 Field Regiment which had been deployed to the area in secrecy just a day earlier. The direct support battery was attached to 168 Field Regiment and served as its \"Sierra\" Battery. Immediately after PAF strikes on Indian airfields on 3 December, Chandpuri dispatched a 20-man strong patrol under 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan to Boundary Pillar (BP) 638, on the international border. This patrol was to play an important part in detecting the advances of Pakistani forces.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:HAL Marut used in the battle of longewala.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the three [[HAL Marut]] used by the IAF against Pakistani armour at Longewala]]\nDuring the night of the 4th, 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's platoon, while on a patrol, detected noises across the border that suggested a large number of armoured vehicles approaching.<ref>p.177, Nayar</ref> These were soon confirmed by reports&nbsp;\u2014 from the Army's Air Observation Post aircraft flown by Maj. Atma Singh&nbsp;\u2014 in the area of a 20&nbsp;km long armoured column on the track leading to the post advancing in the general direction of the Longewala post.<ref>p.239, Rao</ref> Directing 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's patrol to trail the advancing armoured column, Chandpuri got in touch with battalion headquarters requesting urgent reinforcements and armour and artillery support. Battalion HQ gave him the choice of staying put, and containing the attack as much as possible, or carrying out a tactical retreat of the company to Ramgarh, as reinforcements would not be available for at least six hours. Considering that Chandpuri's command had no transportation, and was facing a mobile enemy, he decided to maintain the defensive position of the post where his troops at least had the benefit of prepared defensive works, rather than conducting a withdrawal at night that was a far riskier option.\n\nThe Pakistani forces began their attack at 12:30 am.<ref name=\"p.83, Imprint\">p.83, Imprint</ref> As the offensive approached the lone outpost, Pakistani artillery opened up across the border with medium artillery guns, killing five of the ten camels from the BSF detachment. As the column of 45 tanks neared the post, Indian defences, lacking the time to lay a prepared minefield, laid a hasty anti-tank minefield as the enemy advanced, one infantryman being killed in the process.<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Years-later-Longewala-reminds-the-do-or-die-battle/articleshow/27554710.cms</ref><ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\">p.42, Sharma</ref> The Indian infantry held their fire until the leading Pakistani tanks had approached to 15\u201330 metres before firing their [[PIAT]]s.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/> They accounted for the first two tanks on the track with their Jeep-mounted 106&nbsp;mm M40 recoilless rifle, with one of its crew being killed during the engagement.<ref>There is a suggestion that there were two RCL-armed Jeeps at the post</ref> This weapon proved quite effective because it was able to engage the thinner top armour of the Pakistani tanks from its elevated position, firing at often stationary, bogged down vehicles. In all, the post defenders claimed 12 tanks destroyed or damaged. The initial Pakistani attack stalled almost immediately when the infantry discovered the barbed wire which was unseen in the night, and interpreted it to signify a minefield. Firing for the Indian RCL crews was made easier by the flames of fires when the spare fuel tanks on the Pakistani tanks, intended to supplement their internal capacity for the advance to Jaisalmer, exploded, at once providing ample light for Indians located on higher ground, and creating a dense acrid [[smoke screen]] at ground level for the Pakistani infantry, adding to the confusion. Two hours were lost as Pakistani sappers were brought up, only to discover there was no minefield. However, at this time Pakistani infantry were required to make another attack, from a different direction, but in the dawn light. The Pakistani advance then attempted to surround the post two hours later by vehicles getting off the road, but many vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers and tanks, in trying to soften up the Indian defenders before attacking, became bogged down in the soft sand of the area surrounding the post. Throughout the engagement, Maj. Chandpuri continued to direct the supporting artillery fire.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/>\n\nAlthough massively outnumbering the Indian defenders, and having surrounded them, the Pakistani troops were unable to advance over open terrain on a full-moon night, under small arms and mortar fire from the outpost.<ref name=\"p.83, Imprint\"/> This encouraged the Indians not to give up their strong defensive position, frustrating the Pakistani commanders. As dawn arrived, the Pakistan forces had still not taken the post, and were now having to do so in full daylight.\n\nIn the morning, the Indian Air Force was finally able to direct some [[HAL HF-24 Marut]]s and [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft to assist the post; they were not outfitted with night vision equipment, and so were delayed from conducting combat missions until dawn.<ref>p.100, Nordeen</ref> With daylight, however, the IAF was able to operate effectively, with the strike aircraft being guided to the targets by the airborne [[Forward Air Controller]] (FAC) Maj. Atma Singh in a HAL Krishak.<ref>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Suresh.html An IAF pilot's account of the battle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205024625/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Suresh.html |date=5 December 2005 }}, Suresh</ref> The Indian aircraft attacked the Pakistani ground troops with the 16 [[Matra]] T-10 rockets and [[ADEN cannon|30 mm cannon]] fire on each aircraft. Without support from the Pakistan Air Force, which was busy elsewhere, the tanks and other armoured vehicles were easy targets for the IAF's Hunters. The range of the 12.7&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft [[heavy machine gun]]s mounted on the tanks was limited and therefore ineffective against the Indian jets. Indian air attacks were made easier by the nature of the barren terrain. Many IAF officers later described the attack as a 'turkey shoot' signifying the lopsidedness. By noon the next day, the assault ended completely, having cost Pakistan 22 tanks claimed destroyed by aircraft fire, 12 by ground anti-tank fire, and some captured after being abandoned, with a total of 100 vehicles claimed to have been destroyed or damaged in the desert around the post. The Pakistani attack was first halted, and then Pakistani forces were forced to withdraw when Indian tanks from the division's cavalry regiment, the [[20th Lancers (India)|20th Lancers]], commanded by Col. Bawa Guruvachan Singh, along with the 17th battalion, [[Rajputana Rifles]], launched their counter-offensive to end the six-hour engagement.<ref name=\"p.42, Sharma\"/> Longewala had proved to be one of the defining moments in the war.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle of Longewala saw heavy Pakistani losses and few Indian casualties. Since the Indians were able to use the defenders' advantage, they managed to inflict heavy losses on the Pakistanis. Indian casualties in the battle were two soldiers along with one of their jeep mounted recoilless rifles knocked out. Pakistani losses were 200 soldiers killed.<ref name=\"Francis\"/> The Pakistanis suffered the loss of 34 tanks destroyed or abandoned, and lost 500 additional vehicles.<ref name=Jaques /> The [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission|judicial commission]] set up at the end of war recommended the commander of 18 Division, Maj. Gen. Mustafa, to be tried for negligence during the war.<ref name=\"HRC Report\">{{Cite report|author=Hamoodur Rehman |authorlink=Hamoodur Rehman |author2=Sheikh Anwarul Haq |author3=Tufail Ali Abdul Rehman |title=Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report |url=http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |publisher=Government of Pakistan |pages=79\u201380 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011310/http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |archivedate= 4 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the Indian victory, there were intelligence and strategic failures on both sides. India's intelligence failed to provide warning of such a large armoured force in the western sector. Moreover, the defending post was not heavily armed to neutralise the enemy. Finally, they did not push home the advantage by destroying the fleeing Pakistani tanks while the IAF had them on the run. They did, however destroy or capture some 36 tanks,<ref name=JH /> remaining one of the largest disproportionate tank casualties for one side in a single battle after [[World War II]].\n\nInvading Pakistan troops meanwhile, had underestimated the Longewala post's defensive capability due to the difficulty of approach over sand, conducting the attack at night and in full-moon light, against stiff resistance encountered there from a well prepared defensive position located on a dominant height. Attacking with virtually no air cover, they took too long to close for an assault on the position, and failed to anticipate availability of Indian [[close air support]]. Given that Pakistan's [[Sherman tank]]s and T-59/Type 59 Chinese tanks were slow on the sandy Thar desert, some military analysts have opined that the attack may have been poorly planned and executed given the terrain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/army-orbat-corps-aor.htm|title=Pakistan Army Order of Battle&nbsp;\u2014 Corps Sectors|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> Some Pakistani tanks suffered engine failures due to overheating in trying to extricate themselves, and were abandoned. The open desert battleground provided little to no cover for the tanks and infantry from air attacks. The plan to capture Longewala may have been good in conception, but failed due to lack of air cover. As a result, two tank regiments failed to take Longewala.\n\n[[File:KuldipsinghchandpuriGujjar.jpg|x216px|right|thumb|Maj. Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, [[Maha Vir Chakra|MVC]].]]\n\nFor his part, the Indian company commander, Maj. (later Brig.) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, was decorated with India's second highest gallantry award, the [[Maha Vir Chakra]]. Several other awards were earned by members of the defending company, and the battalion's commander. On the other hand, the Pakistani divisional commander was dismissed from service. However, the commander of the Pakistani 51 Brigade who mounted the daring attack and crossed into Indian territory was later awarded Pakistan's high award of the [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]].\n\nBritish media reported the defence of Longewala. James Hatter compared the Battle of Longewala as to [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in his article ''Taking on the enemy at Longewala'' describing it as the deciding moment of the 1971 war.<ref name=JH />  Similarly, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Carver Field Marshal R.M.

Dutta]] and starred [[Sunny Deol]] as Maj. Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, [[Jackie Shroff]] as Wg. Cdr. M.S. Bawa, [[Sunil Shetty]] as Capt. Bhairon Singh (BSF), and the then [[teen idol]] [[Akshaye Khanna]] as 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan.<ref>p.17, Alter</ref> The main criticism of the movie was that it showed Indian forces being in a terrible position before any sort of help came from the [[Indian Air Force]]. The movie also exaggerates the casualties of Indian soldiers for dramatic purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118751/|title=Border|author=|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> This was not the case in the real incident as Indian forces had defended a position on a height that commanded the area, and were able to defend it effectively due to tactical mistakes made by the Pakistani commanders. This resulted in only two [[sepoy]]s being killed before combat ceased.
