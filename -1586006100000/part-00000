One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both..\n\nThe play portrays the chance meeting, subsequent love affair, and eventual parting of a married woman and a physician. The sadness of their serious and secretive affair is contrasted throughout the play with the boisterous, uncomplicated relationship of a second couple. ''Still Life'' differs from most of the plays in the cycle by having an unhappy ending.\n\nThe play was first produced in London in May 1936 and was staged in New York in October of that year. It has been revived frequently and has been adapted for television and radio and, as ''[[Brief Encounter]]'', for the cinema.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre.

It charts the love affair between Laura Jesson, a housewife, and Alec Harvey, a married physician. The location is the refreshment room of \"Milford Junction\" railway station.\n\nIn the first scene, Myrtle, who runs the station buffet, rebuffs the attempts of Albert, the ticket-inspector, to flirt with her. Laura is waiting for her train home after shopping. She is in pain from a piece of grit that has been blown into her eye. Alec introduces himself as a doctor and quickly removes it for her. She thanks him and goes to catch her train.\n\nThree months later, Alec and Laura are once more in the refreshment room. It becomes clear that after their first meeting they encountered each other a second time by chance and have enjoyed each other's company to the extent of arranging to lunch together and go to the cinema. There have been several such meetings. Laura is beginning to wonder about the propriety of meeting him so often, but Alec reminds her that he too is married, with children and other responsibilities.\n\nIn the third scene, set in October, Albert and Myrtle continue their slightly combative flirtation. Alec and Laura come in, and over coffee they admit that they are in love with each other. They are both determined not to upset their happy marriages, but will meet secretly. They make arrangements to meet at the flat of a friend of Alec.\n\nBy December, they are both agonised by guilt and agree that their affair must stop. Alec tells Laura that he has been offered an attractive medical post in South Africa, and will accept it unless she asks him not to.\n\nThe fifth and final scene is set in March. Albert seems to be making progress with Myrtle. Alec and Laura enter. He is leaving to take up his new post in South Africa, and she has come to see him off. They are prevented from having the passionate farewell they both yearn for when Dolly, a talkative friend of hers intrudes into their last moments together, and their final goodbye is cruelly limited to a formal handshake. He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \"looking very white and shaky\".<ref>Coward, p. 380</ref> Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls.\n\n==Reception==\nCoward himself later said of the play, \"''Still Life'' was the most mature play of the whole series.... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\"<ref name=nc>Coward, unnumbered introductory page</ref> John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\"<ref>Lahr, p. 3</ref> At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. ''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the whole play is given life and its fullest pathos by the restrained dialogue, in which little is said but much implied.<ref name=levin47>Levin, p. 47</ref>|}}\nLevin suggests that when Laura rushes onto the platform as the express train thunders by she has suicide in mind;<ref name=levin47/> this possibility is made explicit in the film adaptation of the play, ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Ashby and Higson, p. 183</ref>\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nA Broadway revival in 1967 starred [[Priscilla Morrill]] and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Laura and Alec.<ref>[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/tonight-at-830-2943 \"Tonight at 8.30\"], Internet Broadway Database.

He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \"looking very white and shaky\".<ref>Coward, p. 380</ref> Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls.\n\n==Reception==\nCoward himself later said of the play, \"''Still Life'' was the most mature play of the whole series.... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\"<ref name=nc>Coward, unnumbered introductory page</ref> John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\"<ref>Lahr, p. 3</ref> At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. ''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the whole play is given life and its fullest pathos by the restrained dialogue, in which little is said but much implied.<ref name=levin47>Levin, p. 47</ref>|}}\nLevin suggests that when Laura rushes onto the platform as the express train thunders by she has suicide in mind;<ref name=levin47/> this possibility is made explicit in the film adaptation of the play, ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Ashby and Higson, p. 183</ref>\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nA Broadway revival in 1967 starred [[Priscilla Morrill]] and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Laura and Alec.<ref>[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/tonight-at-830-2943 \"Tonight at 8.30\"], Internet Broadway Database.
