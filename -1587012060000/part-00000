Native Americans have been questioning the use of the name and image since the 1960s, while the topic has received widespread public attention since the 1990s.

The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. This is created very long ago, but the gods are not true.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth. This proves many theories.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp; BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Orion is essentially the godfather of hunting, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span> \n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC.

The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#34 ''Astronomia;''] the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#195 ''Fabulae''] have Poseidon.</ref> a modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion''.</ref>\n\nThe same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis because he charmed Artemis with his Bow and arrow skills, with the blessing of Artemis, Orion has archery skills unparalleled to any other archers in history; which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria.

In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or [[Nymphai Hyperboreioi|Opis]], a [[Hyperborean]] maiden in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', and Frazer's notes. Artemis is called Opis in [[Callimachus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Call.+H.+3+hymns+3.170 Hymn 3.204''f''] and elsewhere (Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 13).</ref> [[Aratus]]'s brief description, in his ''Astronomy'', conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on ''Chios'', and the Scorpion kills him there.<ref>Aratus, ''Phaenomena'' I, 634\u2013646. quoted in Kubiak, p. 14.</ref> [[Nicander]], in his ''Theriaca'', has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small (''oligos'') stone.<ref>Nicander, ''Theriaca'', lines 15\u201320.</ref> Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly on whom [[Aesculapius]] brought back from the dead;<ref>Zeus slew Aesculapius for his presumption in raising the dead, so there was only one subject.</ref> the Argive epic poet [[Telesarchus]] is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion.<ref>[[Pherecydes of Athens]] ''Testimonianze i frammenti'' ed.

One source refers to Merope as Oenopion's wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', pp. 201\u2013204; for Merope as the wife of Oenopion, he cites the scholiast on [[Nicander]], ''Theriaca'' 15.

Unlike most of Parthenius' stories, no source is noted in the MS.</ref> It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called A\u00ebro or Leiro.<ref>Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; ''A\u00ebro'' is from [[Stephen Gaselee (diplomat)|Stephen Gaselee]]'s Loeb edition; ''Leiro'' \"lily\" is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. \"Leiro\" is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a ''Liro'' as a companion of Oenopion.</ref> Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.\n\n[[Image:Orion constellation Hevelius.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Hevelius]] drew the Orion constellation in ''Uranographia'', his celestial catalogue in 1690]] [[Lucian]] includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building, in which Orion is walking into the rising sun with Lemnos nearby, Cedalion on his shoulder.

He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship.

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418\u2013435 Soubiran).</ref>\n\nOrion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20120717020804/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time.

The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. This story was created in 500 BCE, so we are not sure.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp; BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Orion is essentially the godfather of hunting, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span> \n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC. The MS is Allen's [[Venetus A]], scholion to \u03a3 486 Dindorf ''Scholia in Iliadem'' II, 171, l.7\u201320; Erbse's Scholia at line cited (Vol.4).</ref> who tells a different story of Orion's birth.

A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.</ref> When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and [[urinate]] into it<ref>Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ''ourion'', thus explaining Orion's name; the version that has come down to us as [Pseudo]-[[Palaephatus]], ''On Unbelievable Tales'' \u00a751 uses ''apespermenan'' (\"to spread seed\") and ''our\u0113sai'' (the infinitive of ''ourion'') in different sentences. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions.

The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis because he charmed Artemis with his Bow and arrow skills, with the blessing of Artemis, Orion has archery skills unparalleled to any other archers in history; which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the [[Oeneus|Calydonian Oeneus]].<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as \"fantastic\".

In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]].

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418\u2013435 Soubiran).</ref>\n\nOrion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20120717020804/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance. Hence Jupiter=Zeus; Neptune= Poseidon, and so forth.

Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow.

The city had a population of 129,920 as of the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]].<ref name=\"Cambridge, City Ontario\"/>\n\nCambridge was formed in 1973 by the [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of [[Galt, Ontario|Galt]], [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]], [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], the settlement of Blair and a small portion of surrounding townships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge.htm |title=About Cambridge Ontario, Canada|date=2015|website=City of Cambridge|publisher=City of Cambridge|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> The former Galt covers the largest portion of Cambridge, making up the southern half of the city. The former Preston and Blair are located on the western side of the city, while the former Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of Cambridge. There was considerable resistance among the local population to the amalgamation arranged by the provincial government, and a rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Local-History.aspx|title=History, Cambridge Ontario|date=2015|website=City of Cambridge|publisher=City of Cambridge|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===History of the City of Galt===\n[[File:Old Post Office Galt Cambridge Ontario.jpg|thumb|Old Post Office in Galt, built in 1886]]\nIn the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations who were led by Joseph Brant. One speculator, [[William Dickson (Upper Canada)|William Dickson]], a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought {{convert|90000|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and sold smaller lots, particularly to Scottish settlers. The centre of the planned community was at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade's Mills.\n\nDickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of John Galt of the [[Canada Company]] which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. The town continued to grow, however, based on a large industrial base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Local-History.aspx |title=History of the Town of Preston: |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Cambridge |publisher=City of Cambridge |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> In fact, Galt was called \"Manchester of Canada\" because of the extensive industry, powered by the Grand River. Some of the important businesses in about 1870 included the Dickson Mills (opened in 1843), the Axe Factory forge, two furniture factories, The Dumfries iron and brass foundry, three large woolen factories, a malt factory, the Victoria Steam Carriage Works, the Dumfries Flour Mill, the Victoria Foundry making farm implements, a large soap and candles works and two steam-powered tanneries.<ref name=\"collectionscanada.gc.ca\">http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf</ref>\n\nRecords from 1846 indicate that Galt had very valuable water-power that allowed for milling and manufacturing. Stone buildings in the downtown area had already been erected and the population was 1000, most originally from Scotland. Amenities included a curling club, library, a weekly newspaper, a school, a bank (Gore) and a fire company. The post office was receiving daily mail. Industries included two grist mills, two saw mills, two foundries, two carding machines and cloth factories, one brewery, two distilleries, one tannery, eight stores, nine taverns, two grocery stores and various tradesmen.<ref name=\"SmithsGaz\" >{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

This settlement became known as Cambridge Mills.\n\nEven in the early 1800s, the area included homes, a store, an inn, small shops operated by artisans and craftsmen, mostly immigrants from Germany. The Erb sons had hired William Scollick for their development business and the latter completed a full survey in 1834; he also convinced the Erbs to rename the Cambridge Mills area Preston.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=9 May 2015 |title=Flash From the Past: Trailblazers nostalgia behind Preston's name\n |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/5607666-flash-from-the-past-traiblazer-s-nostalgia-behind-preston-s-name/ | work=Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> After Erb's death in 1832, a son sold off property on both sides of the Speed River.

The building still stands (but is vacant). In the late 19th century, it featured five acres of grounds with gardens and lawns. The primary draw was the mineral baths in the hotel's basement, said to \"cleanse\" the body.

The group later discovered that Beasley had gotten into financial trouble and that a lien was placed on the lands. To solve the problem, the group created the German Company that bought an additional 60,000 acres of land from Beasley who used the proceeds to pay off the debt on the previous lands. This ensured a clear title for the Mennonite group.\n\nBy 1804, the first cemetery in Waterloo County had been founded. Located in Blair, it is often referred to as the Old Blair Cemetery or the Old Blair Memorial Cemetery.

The new name honoured Adam Johnston Fergusson-Blair, the first judge of Wellington District and a militia colonel in the area.

The $30 million project was completed on time and on budget and financed through a settlement of a loan with the city's hydro utility. A conservative estimate comparing a standard {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building to the new City Hall LEED-standard building results in a $160,000 savings on energy per year or some $1.6 Million over 10 years. The open concept of the facility allows for greater airflow, reducing cooling costs and increasing the penetration of natural light to offset other light sources. A four-story \"living wall\" of tropical plants is located in the atrium and cleanses the air of pollutants such as formaldehyde, [[volatile organic compounds]], dust, and spores. Behind the living wall is a running water supply that provides humidity during the winter months and a soothing sound for employees and visitors to enjoy all year round.\n\nThe historic city hall in Cambridge was built in 1858 by local architect H.B. Sinclair for $3,650, replacing the original structure built in 1838. Built of granite and white limestone, locally found blue granite was used as a decorative feature. The Historic City Hall served as the community's town hall and marketplace. Today, the Historic City Hall and the New City Hall are connected by a hallway constructed shortly after the New City Hall was built.\n\nIn the tradition of environmental stewardship, Cambridge preserves over 365 hectares of parkland which make up more than 80 parks in the city, as well as over 140&nbsp;km of on-road cycling lanes.\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n!Ethnic origin\n!Population\n!Percent\n|-\n|[[Canadians|Canadian]]\n|38,515\n|30.1\n|-\n|[[English People|English]]\n|34,345\n|26.9\n|-\n|[[Scottish people|Scottish]]\n|25,495\n|19.9\n|-\n|[[Irish people|Irish]]\n|23,865\n|18.7\n|-\n|[[Germans|German]]\n|17,660\n|13.8\n|-\n|[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]\n|12,120\n|9.5\n|-\n|[[French people|French]]\n|11,760\n|9.2\n|-\n|[[Dutch people|Dutch]]\n|6,035\n|4.7\n|-\n|[[Italian people|Italian]]\n|5,540\n|4.3\n|-\n|[[Indian people|East Indian]]\n|5,330\n|4.2\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Source: [[StatCan]] (includes multiple responses)</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3530010&Geo2=CD&Code2=3530&SearchText=cambridge&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Ethnic%20origin&TABID=1&type=0|title=Cambridge, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Waterloo, Regional municipality [Census division], Ontario|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n|}\nCambridge has been characterized by rapid growth in recent years.

Sikhs, Muslims, [[Hindus]] and other faiths make a little over 5% of the population. Over the last few years the numbers of [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Pakistanis]] and [[Afghans]] moving in from other urban areas or immigrating from their respective countries, has doubled and tripled. Cambridge is also much younger than the national average. 21.6% of the population is under 14 years of age. Only 11% of the population is over 65, resulting in an average age of 35.2, slightly lower than the national average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Interurban streetcar system===\n[[File:GPH-PB station and car barn.jpg|thumb|The car barn for the Galt, Preston, Hespeler and Preston, Berlin railway.]]\n\nA streetcar system, the [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway]] (later called the Grand River Railway Company) also began to operate in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=CAMBRIDGE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON WATERLOO REGION'S LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |publisher=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills\"/> The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.\n\n===Roads===\nThere are two main arterial roads that form an 'X' through the city. The intersecting point is colloquially referred to as the Delta. The intersection was once known as Hunter's Corners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/4334249--tbt-flash-from-the-past-delta-intersection-in-cambridge-wasn-t-always-so-busy/|title=#TBT Flash from the Past: Delta intersection in Cambridge wasn\u2019t always so busy|last=Fear|first=Jon|date=2014-01-24|website=TheRecord.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> The Delta is adjacent to a Canadian Pacific Rail spur and the Babcock & Wilcox plant, and at peak rush hour times traffic would back up for miles radiating outwards from the Delta. A number of strategies were investigated to alleviate delays caused by trains and as of December 2012 construction of a bridge over Hespeler Road commenced, and was completed 18 months later. While this eliminated delays caused by trains, the Delta remains a very busy intersection. Multiphase traffic signals with restrictions on right turns on red constrain vehicular throughput compared to typical signalized intersections. [[Highway 8 (Ontario)]] travels through the city as Shantz Hill Road, King Street in Preston, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street, linking Cambridge to [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] in the west, and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in the east. [[Highway 24 (Ontario)|Highway 24]] runs through Cambridge as Hespeler Road, Water Street, and Ainslie Street, connecting to [[Guelph]] in the northeast and [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] in the south.\n\n===Bridges===\nCambridge has some of the most historic bridges in Waterloo Region. The Black Bridge Road Bridge (1916) is Cambridge's only [[truss bridge]] and has been designated a heritage site since 1997. It is still driven upon, though it is prone to major flooding and subsequent closure in the spring. The [[Cambridge Main Street Bridge|Main Street Bridge]] (1931) is a [[Tied-arch bridge|bowstring arch bridge]] made of concrete and is set over the Grand River. Also in Cambridge is the Park Hill Road Bridge (2002), formally known as the Queen Street Bridge (1933).  This bridge was one of the three bridges credited with contributing to the development of early Galt. The bridge was reconstructed and widened to four lanes in 2002 retaining much of the original appearance. The Mill Creek Bridge (1837) in Cambridge is the oldest remaining bridge structure in the region and one of only two stone masonry arch bridges in the Region of Waterloo.<ref>https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/Mill-Creek-Bridge-Plaque-access.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Region of Waterloo completed the first pedestrian/cycling bridge to cross the 401. This bridge connects Morningside Drive (Cambridge) with Doon Valley Drive (Kitchener) and is an integral part of the Grand River Trails.\n\n===Public transportation===\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former '''Cambridge Transit''' and '''Kitchener Transit'''.\n\nGRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 52, 61, 72, and 111 buses run to southern [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], while the [[Grand River Transit#iXpress|iXpress]] limited-stop express route runs from the [[Ainslie St. Transit Terminal]] through Kitchener to the north end of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]].\n\nIntercity service is served by [[Greyhound Lines]], from a terminal near [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] and Hespeler Road.

The city had a population of 129,920 as of the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]].<ref name=\"Cambridge, City Ontario\"/>\n\nCambridge was formed in 1973 by the [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of [[Galt, Ontario|Galt]], [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]], [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], the settlement of Blair and a small portion of surrounding townships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge.htm |title=About Cambridge Ontario, Canada|date=2015|website=City of Cambridge|publisher=City of Cambridge|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> The former Galt covers the largest portion of Cambridge, making up the southern half of the city. The former Preston and Blair are located on the western side of the city, while the former Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of Cambridge. There was considerable resistance among the local population to the amalgamation arranged by the provincial government, and a rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Local-History.aspx|title=History, Cambridge Ontario|date=2015|website=City of Cambridge|publisher=City of Cambridge|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===History of the City of Galt===\n[[File:Old Post Office Galt Cambridge Ontario.jpg|thumb|Old Post Office in Galt, built in 1886]]\nIn the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations who were led by Joseph Brant. One speculator, [[William Dickson (Upper Canada)|William Dickson]], a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought {{convert|90000|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and sold smaller lots, particularly to Scottish settlers. The centre of the planned community was at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade's Mills.\n\nDickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of John Galt of the [[Canada Company]] which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s.

Sinclair for $3,650, replacing the original structure built in 1838. Built of granite and white limestone, locally found blue granite was used as a decorative feature. The Historic City Hall served as the community's town hall and marketplace. Today, the Historic City Hall and the New City Hall are connected by a hallway constructed shortly after the New City Hall was built.\n\nIn the tradition of environmental stewardship, Cambridge preserves over 365 hectares of parkland which make up more than 80 parks in the city, as well as over 140&nbsp;km of on-road cycling lanes.\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n!Ethnic origin\n!Population\n!Percent\n|-\n|[[Canadians|Canadian]]\n|38,515\n|30.1\n|-\n|[[English People|English]]\n|34,345\n|26.9\n|-\n|[[Scottish people|Scottish]]\n|25,495\n|19.9\n|-\n|[[Irish people|Irish]]\n|23,865\n|18.7\n|-\n|[[Germans|German]]\n|17,660\n|13.8\n|-\n|[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]\n|12,120\n|9.5\n|-\n|[[French people|French]]\n|11,760\n|9.2\n|-\n|[[Dutch people|Dutch]]\n|6,035\n|4.7\n|-\n|[[Italian people|Italian]]\n|5,540\n|4.3\n|-\n|[[Indian people|East Indian]]\n|5,330\n|4.2\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Source: [[StatCan]] (includes multiple responses)</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3530010&Geo2=CD&Code2=3530&SearchText=cambridge&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Ethnic%20origin&TABID=1&type=0|title=Cambridge, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Waterloo, Regional municipality [Census division], Ontario|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n|}\nCambridge has been characterized by rapid growth in recent years. The population in 2006 was 120,371; by 2011 it was 126,748 and by 2016 it had increased to 129,920.<ref name=\"Cambridge, City Ontario\">{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3530010&Geo2=PR&Code2=12&Data=Count&SearchText=Freeport&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&wbdisable=true|title=Cambridge, City Ontario  |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=Census profile, [[Canada 2016 Census]] |date=2016|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, Cambridge is approximately 81% white, 15.6% visible minorities and 3.4% aboriginal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3530010&Geo2=CD&Code2=3530&SearchText=cambridge&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=1|title=Cambridge, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Waterloo, Regional municipality [Census division], Ontario}}</ref> Visible minority groups include: 6.2% [[South Asian Canadian|South Asian]], 1.1% [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]], 2.5% [[Black Canadians|Black]], and 2.1% [[Southeast Asia]]n.\n\nThe city is largely Christian at 80.2%, followed by non-religious people who comprise 15%. Sikhs, Muslims, [[Hindus]] and other faiths make a little over 5% of the population. Over the last few years the numbers of [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Pakistanis]] and [[Afghans]] moving in from other urban areas or immigrating from their respective countries, has doubled and tripled. Cambridge is also much younger than the national average. 21.6% of the population is under 14 years of age. Only 11% of the population is over 65, resulting in an average age of 35.2, slightly lower than the national average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Interurban streetcar system===\n[[File:GPH-PB station and car barn.jpg|thumb|The car barn for the Galt, Preston, Hespeler and Preston, Berlin railway.]]\n\nA streetcar system, the [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway]] (later called the Grand River Railway Company) also began to operate in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=CAMBRIDGE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON WATERLOO REGION'S LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |publisher=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills\"/> The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.\n\n===Roads===\nThere are two main arterial roads that form an 'X' through the city. The intersecting point is colloquially referred to as the Delta. The intersection was once known as Hunter's Corners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/4334249--tbt-flash-from-the-past-delta-intersection-in-cambridge-wasn-t-always-so-busy/|title=#TBT Flash from the Past: Delta intersection in Cambridge wasn\u2019t always so busy|last=Fear|first=Jon|date=2014-01-24|website=TheRecord.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> The Delta is adjacent to a Canadian Pacific Rail spur and the Babcock & Wilcox plant, and at peak rush hour times traffic would back up for miles radiating outwards from the Delta. A number of strategies were investigated to alleviate delays caused by trains and as of December 2012 construction of a bridge over Hespeler Road commenced, and was completed 18 months later. While this eliminated delays caused by trains, the Delta remains a very busy intersection. Multiphase traffic signals with restrictions on right turns on red constrain vehicular throughput compared to typical signalized intersections. [[Highway 8 (Ontario)]] travels through the city as Shantz Hill Road, King Street in Preston, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street, linking Cambridge to [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] in the west, and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in the east. [[Highway 24 (Ontario)|Highway 24]] runs through Cambridge as Hespeler Road, Water Street, and Ainslie Street, connecting to [[Guelph]] in the northeast and [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] in the south.\n\n===Bridges===\nCambridge has some of the most historic bridges in Waterloo Region. The Black Bridge Road Bridge (1916) is Cambridge's only [[truss bridge]] and has been designated a heritage site since 1997. It is still driven upon, though it is prone to major flooding and subsequent closure in the spring. The [[Cambridge Main Street Bridge|Main Street Bridge]] (1931) is a [[Tied-arch bridge|bowstring arch bridge]] made of concrete and is set over the Grand River. Also in Cambridge is the Park Hill Road Bridge (2002), formally known as the Queen Street Bridge (1933).  This bridge was one of the three bridges credited with contributing to the development of early Galt. The bridge was reconstructed and widened to four lanes in 2002 retaining much of the original appearance. The Mill Creek Bridge (1837) in Cambridge is the oldest remaining bridge structure in the region and one of only two stone masonry arch bridges in the Region of Waterloo.<ref>https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/Mill-Creek-Bridge-Plaque-access.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Region of Waterloo completed the first pedestrian/cycling bridge to cross the 401. This bridge connects Morningside Drive (Cambridge) with Doon Valley Drive (Kitchener) and is an integral part of the Grand River Trails.\n\n===Public transportation===\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former '''Cambridge Transit''' and '''Kitchener Transit'''.\n\nGRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 52, 61, 72, and 111 buses run to southern [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], while the [[Grand River Transit#iXpress|iXpress]] limited-stop express route runs from the [[Ainslie St. Transit Terminal]] through Kitchener to the north end of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]].\n\nIntercity service is served by [[Greyhound Lines]], from a terminal near [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] and Hespeler Road. Commuter service to and from Toronto is the key routing, and no local trips are permitted to or from [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]. On October 31, 2009, Go Transit started service with a line from Square One shopping centre in Mississauga to the University of Waterloo, therefore allowing a trip to Kitchener from a terminal outside the Wal-Mart Power Centre. [[Coach Canada]] run almost every two hours during the daytime between [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], and connecting to [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n===Light rapid transit===\n{{See also|Rapid transit in Waterloo Region}}\nIn June 2011, regional council approved the plan for a [[light rail]] transit line from Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener, with rapid buses through to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |title=Rail plan passes |publisher=TheRecord |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> In Phase 1, to start operating in 2018, the [[Ion rapid transit]] will run between Waterloo and Kitchener, passing through the downtown/uptown areas. Most of the rails had been installed by late 2016 for this Stage 1 service.\n\nStage 2 of the rail line would run from Fairview Mall to the \"downtown Galt\" area of Cambridge.

As a testament to the city's growing international profile, in 1990 the [[International Olympic Committee]] selected [[Atlanta]] as the site of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Taking advantage of Atlanta's status as a transportation hub, in 1991 [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] established its headquarters in a suburb.

It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the [[Chattooga River]], its most significant [[tributary]]. These bounds were decided in the 1797 [[Treaty of Beaufort]], and tested in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the two ''[[Georgia v. South Carolina]]'' cases in 1923 and 1989.\n\nThe border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]], at [[35th parallel north|latitude 35\u00b0N]], though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey). This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the [[Mississippi River]], until [[Tennessee]] was divided from [[North Carolina]], and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoybLve0aQC&pg=PA30 |author=Ulrich Bonnell Phillips|title= Georgia and state rights: a study of the political history of Georgia from the Revolution to the Civil War|publisher=Annual Report of American Historical Association for the 57th US Congress, 1901|page=30|accessdate=October 23, 2012|year=1902}}</ref>\n\nThe state's western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], to meet the [[Chattahoochee River]] near [[West Point, Georgia|West Point]]. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] (the confluence of the two forming Florida's [[Apalachicola River]]); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Mary's River]], which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.\n\nThe water boundaries are still set to be the original [[thalweg]] of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the [[ACF River Basin|Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint]] point now under [[Lake Seminole]].\n\nGeorgia state legislators have claimed that in an 1818 survey the state's border with Tennessee was erroneously placed one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) farther south than intended, and they [[Tennessee-Georgia water dispute|still dispute it]].

This record was established largely due to the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most blacks]] and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://umich.edu/~lawrace/votetour6.htm | title=Race, Voting Rights, and Segregation | work=University of Michigan | accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhite Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=Saye|first1=Albert B.|title=A Constitutional History of Georgia, 1732\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kwD3PrldCfUC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&q=1908%20georgia%20constitutional%20amendment|publisher=University of Georgia Press|accessdate=May 18, 2016|isbn=9780820335544|date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia].

It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the [[American Revolution]] through the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia's 1908 Disfranchisement Constitutional Amendment|url=https://raycityhistory.wordpress.com/tag/georgias-1908-disfranchisement-constitutional-amendment/|website=Ray City History|publisher=Ray City Community Library|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Progressivism|Progressives]] promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics.

According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/georgias-white-voters-elude-democrats/nSdq4 |title=White voters solidly in for GOP in Georgia (October 16, 2012) |publisher=Ajc.com |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> In the decades since the late 20th century, the conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices.\n\nIn 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor [[Roy Barnes]] was defeated by Republican [[Sonny Perdue]], a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.\n\nEven before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son [[Jimmy Carter]] carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.<ref name=\"CNN.com: Election 2004\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], former head of the [[John Birch Society]], who died when the [[Soviet Union]] shot down [[KAL 007]] near [[Sakhalin Island]]. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,<ref name=\"CNN.com: Election 2004\"/> as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.\n\nThe ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] member [[Newt Gingrich]] being elected as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for President in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.\n\nIn 2008, Democrat [[Jim Martin (Georgia politician)|Jim Martin]] ran against incumbent Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]]. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the [[runoff election]] held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the 2018 elections, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] remained a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a democratic [[African Americans|black]] [[female]], [[Stacey Abrams]]), Republicans lost eight seats in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia Senate]] (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia Election Results |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia/ |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia House of Representatives elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia State Senate elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the last three presidential elections as of 2018, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as [[United States presidential elections in Michigan|Michigan]], [[United States presidential elections in Ohio|Ohio]] and [[United States presidential elections in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. Therefore, it could potentially be regarded as a [[swing state]] in future elections should voter preferences only shift slightly.\n\n===Politics===\n{{main|Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)}}\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'' (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.\n\nA related case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of \"one man, one vote\"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.<ref name=\"epstein\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmPKNI2z5-AC&pg=PA753&lpg=PA753?+Apportionment?#v=onepage&q=Was%20Georgia%20dominated%20by%20rural%20districts%3F%20Apportionment%3F Lee Epstein, Thomas G. Walk, ''Constitutional Law: Rights, Liberties and Justice 8th Edition''], SAGE, 2012, p. 753</ref> From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law.\n\nEconomic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging \"[[New South]]\". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.\n\nIn the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor [[Zell Miller]], decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for such measures as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning [[same-sex marriage]]s was approved by 76% of voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_%282004%29 |title=Georgia Marriage Amendment, Question 1 (2004) |publisher=Ballotpedia |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in ''[[Obergefell v.

This record was established largely due to the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most blacks]] and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://umich.edu/~lawrace/votetour6.htm | title=Race, Voting Rights, and Segregation | work=University of Michigan | accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhite Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=Saye|first1=Albert B.|title=A Constitutional History of Georgia, 1732\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kwD3PrldCfUC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&q=1908%20georgia%20constitutional%20amendment|publisher=University of Georgia Press|accessdate=May 18, 2016|isbn=9780820335544|date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia].

It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the [[American Revolution]] through the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote.

According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/georgias-white-voters-elude-democrats/nSdq4 |title=White voters solidly in for GOP in Georgia (October 16, 2012) |publisher=Ajc.com |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> In the decades since the late 20th century, the conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices.\n\nIn 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor [[Roy Barnes]] was defeated by Republican [[Sonny Perdue]], a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.\n\nEven before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son [[Jimmy Carter]] carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.<ref name=\"CNN.com: Election 2004\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], former head of the [[John Birch Society]], who died when the [[Soviet Union]] shot down [[KAL 007]] near [[Sakhalin Island]]. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,<ref name=\"CNN.com: Election 2004\"/> as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.\n\nThe ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] member [[Newt Gingrich]] being elected as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for President in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.\n\nIn 2008, Democrat [[Jim Martin (Georgia politician)|Jim Martin]] ran against incumbent Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]]. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the [[runoff election]] held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the 2018 elections, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] remained a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a democratic [[African Americans|black]] [[female]], [[Stacey Abrams]]), Republicans lost eight seats in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia Senate]] (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia Election Results |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia/ |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia House of Representatives elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia State Senate elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the last three presidential elections as of 2018, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as [[United States presidential elections in Michigan|Michigan]], [[United States presidential elections in Ohio|Ohio]] and [[United States presidential elections in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. Therefore, it could potentially be regarded as a [[swing state]] in future elections should voter preferences only shift slightly.\n\n===Politics===\n{{main|Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)}}\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'' (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.\n\nA related case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of \"one man, one vote\"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.<ref name=\"epstein\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmPKNI2z5-AC&pg=PA753&lpg=PA753?+Apportionment?#v=onepage&q=Was%20Georgia%20dominated%20by%20rural%20districts%3F%20Apportionment%3F Lee Epstein, Thomas G.

It was a bedrock of the emerging \"[[New South]]\". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.\n\nIn the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor [[Zell Miller]], decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for such measures as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning [[same-sex marriage]]s was approved by 76% of voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_%282004%29 |title=Georgia Marriage Amendment, Question 1 (2004) |publisher=Ballotpedia |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in ''[[Obergefell v.

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live with his partner and her young son.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/fish-turns-down-yes-role-over-germany-move-1-3479476|title=Fish turns down Yes role over Germany

([[Hosea 9]]:10, [[Jeremiah 24]]), or a fig tree that bears no fruit ([[Jeremiah 8]]:13), and in [[Micah 4]]:4 the age of the [[messiah]] is pictured as one in which each man would sit under his fig tree without fear; the cursing of the fig tree in Mark and Matthew and the parallel story in Luke are thus symbolically directed against the Jews, who have not accepted Jesus as king.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=170-171}}{{sfn|Dumbrell|2001|p=175}} At first sight the destruction of the fig tree does not seem to fit Jesus' behaviour elsewhere, but the miracle stories are directed

{"title_page": "Charles Francis Walsh", "text_new": "{{for|the football coach|Chile Walsh}}\n\n[[File:Charles Francis Walsh circa 1910.jpg|thumb|Charles Francis Walsh in 1910]]\n'''Charles Francis Walsh''' (October 27, 1877 &ndash; October 3, 1912) was an American pioneer aviator who died in a crash in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].\n\n==Early life==\nCharles Francis Walsh was born in [[Mission Valley, California]], on October 27, 1877, to Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Walsh. When he was a young boy, the family moved to nearby [[San Diego, California]]. Growing up, he worked in his father's grocery store.  Enterprising even at an early age, he started his own bicycle business as a teenager, but this would be the first of several unsuccessful ventures for Walsh until his early thirties.  In 1901, at the age of 24, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles and took a job as a [[stationary engineer]] at the California General Hospital in [[Los Angeles]]. It was there that he met a young nursing student named Alice Connolly.  They were married on September 23, 1903.\n\nIn January 1904, he and his new wife moved to [[Winslow, Arizona]], where he went to work for the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] as a freight train engineer.  Charles grew impatient during what turned out to be a long and frustrating apprenticeship, so he moved back to Los Angeles to work in an oil refinery as a field engineer.  It was not long, however, before they ventured to [[Goldfield, Nevada]], to seek their share of the gold fortune believed to be there.  At first, the Walshes were able to make decent money supporting the blossoming mining industry of the town.  The couple did return to Los Angeles in the spring of 1905 to give birth to their son Kenneth, while Charles briefly returned to work in the oil fields.  They returned to Goldfield a short time later.  Alice gave birth to a daughter (Juanita) there the following year.  When Goldfield died a quick death in 1907, however, a financially troubled Walsh was forced to move his family into his father's house at 17th and K streets in San Diego.\n\nCharles found work as an elevator operator in a local hotel.  Walsh became fascinated with aviation from reading about the subject in the local newspapers. Using only pictures from these newspapers, he sketched his own airplane design in between elevator trips at work and was determined to fly it one day.  In 1909, Walsh convinced a small group of local investors to open the first airplane manufacturing company in California.<ref name=Matt2000>Matt, P. R. (n.d.). Charles Francis Walsh (K. C. Rust, Ed.).

Walsh was vice president and general manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=The San Diego Aeroplane Manufacturing Company, Inc. |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-09-25_7.pdf}}</ref> He built his airplane in the old Rogers carriage shop on Third Street (between E and F Streets) near the company headquarters.<ref>{{cite web |title=On Exhibit |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-10-26_14.pdf}}</ref>  This location is now a parking garage for the [[Westfield Horton Plaza]].\n\nBy late November, Walsh had essentially completed his airplane.  Built from seasoned spruce and piano wire it measured 40 feet long with a 50-foot wingspan.  It was reported to be the largest monoplane in the world at the time.  Like the Wright Brothers design, a motor drove twin pusher propellers through a bicycle chain.  The propellers were seven feet long and made of Oregon pine with hickory hubs.  Like Curtiss, he used a tricycle type landing gear and ailerons vice the Wright's wing warping method for lateral control of his Bleriot-type monoplane.  His wings tapered from curved in the middle to flat ends.  The reason given for this is that the newspaper picture he used as his template for the design had the ends of the wings cutoff, so that is how he thought they looked.  Attached to these was his specially designed device to automatically provide lateral stability to his airplane.  This consisted of a fifteen-pound weight suspended from a five-foot rod which was connected to both wingtips.  As air flow acted on the wings, the weight would act as to raise on wingtip and lower the other, maintaining lateral stability without pilot input.  For control, Walsh designed a dual lever system, closely resembling that of the Wright Brothers.  One controlled the engine and one controlled the pitch. It was powered by a 30 H. P. Cameron automobile engine.<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Inventor Will Fly Worlds Largest Monoplane |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-11-21_7.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWalsh tested his airplane at the [[Coronado Island]] Country Club racetrack during the last week of December.  He was one of three local San Diego aviators, including [[Waldo Waterman]], attempting to enter an airplane in the [[1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field]].  The airplane was damaged during ground runs at Coronado on December 29.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Aviators Have Usual Trouble |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-12-31_6_(1).pdf}}</ref>  His wife Alice sold her jewelry so that he could attend the event as a spectator.  While there, he made the most of the opportunity to learn about airplane design from the most legendary pioneers in aviation.  When it was decided that San Diego would host its own air meet immediately following the one in Los Angeles, Walsh hurried home to incorporate what he learned into his own design as he rebuilt his airplane ahead of the event.<ref>Morehouse, H. E. (n.d.). Unpublished manuscript, Harold E. Morehouse Flying Pioneers Biographies collection, National Air and Space Museum Archives</ref>\n\nHe shortened his wingspan by approximately five feet, shortened the front elevator support assembly by ten feet, and added a \"horizontal plane\" over the rear rudder.  He also removed one of his rear rudders and abandoned his problematic chain-drive, dual-propeller configuration for a single-propeller, direct-drive system.  Walsh ordered a new six-foot propeller and intended to purchase one from [[Charles K. Hamilton]] upon his arrival at Coronado for the 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet.  All of this yielded a 100-pound savings in weight and better controllability.  His Cameron engine was raised two feet above the lower level of the main frame and produced 2000 rpm.<ref>{{cite web |title=$1000 Added to Aviation Prize |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:January_22_1910(Coronado).pdf}}</ref>\n\n===1910 San Diego Aviation Meet===\nDuring the [[1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field]], Charles K. Hamilton was invited by some San Diego businessmen to come to [[Coronado Island]] and attempt to beat the altitude record that [[Louis Paulhan]] set during that meet.  For the people of San Diego, the event was about attracting aviation to San Diego and raising money for the [[Panama-California Exposition]] the city planned to host in 1915.  [[Glenn Curtiss]] was in search of a suitable location for a winter headquarters and asked Hamilton to scout out San Diego for him.  He loaned Hamilton his [[Curtiss No. 2]] \"Reims Racer\" for this purpose.  The 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet was scheduled for January 23\u201325.  Charles F. Walsh was guaranteed the first $500 in profits to demonstrate his airplane on the opening day of the meet.<ref>Jackrabbits to jets: the history of Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, California Elretta Sudsbury - San Diego Pub. Co. - 1992</ref>  Walsh destroyed his airplane during his demonstration on the opening day of the meet when he was forced to taxi his airplane into a fence to avoid hitting Hamilton and the Reims Racer.  Two days later, Hamilton took Walsh along for a flight as a passenger in the Reims Racer.  This was the first flight for Walsh.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hamilton Wrecks Biplane in the Last Flight of Meet |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-01-26_6.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur aviation career==\n===Imperial Beach, California===\nFollowing the San Diego Aviation Meet, Walsh built a new airplane in less than 30 days.<ref name=SDUnionJune2>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walsh_crash,_June_1910.pdf]</ref>  He was invited by a San Diego developer named E W Peterson to move his airplane to nearby Imperial Beach, California.  Peterson had three 30-foot-wide by 600-foot-long runways graded for this purpose.  Around April 1, 1910, Walsh began developing an aviation camp there while testing his new airplane.  The plane was a nearly exact copy of the Reims Racer in which he had flown as a passenger with Charles K. Hamilton.  Walsh added features of his own design that he hoped would simplify controllability, however.  Instead of a shoulder yoke for lateral control, Walsh mounted the steering wheel to a post on a double hinge, allowing for dual-axis control to operate the ailerons in addition to the elevators via a wire connection to the ailerons from the base of the control yoke. The engine-shutoff and starting wheel brake were controlled by a single lever fastened directly over the left side of the foot rest.  The same motion of the foot-operated both devices.  The engine speed lever was still connected to the frame next to the pilot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roehrig Biplane Is Nearly Ready For Its First Tryout |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-04-08_19.pdf}}</ref>  A day or two later, Walsh added a thrust bearing to his engine, yielding an additional 25% increase in speed.  On April 10, 1910, approximately 100 onlookers witnessed his first flight.  Reaching an altitude of 15\u201320 feet, he flew for approximately 400 feet over the Imperial Beach runway before executing a reportedly flawless landing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walsh In His New Biplane Flies 400 feet on Beach |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-04-11_8.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy late May, he had already turned down offers to perform during the Fourth of July celebration of Baker City, Oregon; St. Louis, Missouri; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The personal expense to him for such long distance trips made him concentrate on opportunities closer to San Diego.  He also made significant improvements to his airplane by this time, adding steel-rimmed wheels for his landing gear and installing a more advanced propeller.  To compensate for the aft center of gravity resulting from the increased weight of his engine relative to the one that powered the Reims Racer that he faithfully modeled his airplane after, he modified his tail to a box design, vice the single elevator.<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Aviator Is Sought By Promoters of 3 Cities |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-05-25_5.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, Walsh suffered a major setback when his airplane crashed following a steep turn during a practice run on the aviation course.  It was quickly determined that his engine could not provide sufficient thrust to maintain altitude at steep angles of bank.  While this accident almost convinced Walsh to abandon aviation altogether, fellow Imperial Beach aviator B F Roehrig began an effort to raise money for a better engine.

On February 19, 1911, Walsh took his entire family flying, powered by an improved Macomber engine.  Charlie, Alice, Kenneth, and Juanita became the first family to every fly together in an airplane.  On March 4, 1911, [[Harry Harkness]] contracted Walsh to build an airplane for use by his chief mechanic John Kiley to learn to fly at the Harkness camp at North Island in San Diego, California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harkness to Fly Biplane Built By San Diegan |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Macomber_(McComber)_Engine_and_Harry_Harkness_Purchases_Airpplane_From_Charlie_Walsh.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Harkness and Walsh Silver Darts===\nWalsh delivered the plane to John Kiley at the Harkness aviation camp at North Island on April 7, 1911.  According to at least one source, Walsh added \"silver dust\" to the unbleached muslin of the flying surfaces.  This earned the aircraft the name \"Silver Dart\".  Harkness paid Walsh $5000 for the plane, finally making him solvent.  A week later, Walsh crashed his plane at Dominguez Field while attempting to qualify as the Aero Club of California's first licensed aviator.  At some point, Walsh built a Silver Dart of his own.  There seems to be disagreement as the whether the Walsh Silver Dart was built before or after his crash at Dominguez.  Like the Silver Dart he sold to [[Harry Harkness]], his was based on the Curtiss airplane of the day, but with four Farman-type ailerons mounted flush to the end of all four wings replacing the Curtiss-style ailerons normally located between the upper and lower wing.  The upper and lower ailerons were connected to each other via a vertical pole and operated in unison.  They were moved via wires connected to the pilots steering wheel post.  The wings also had about 1/3 more surface area than a Curtiss, spanning 40 feet with a 4.5 foot chord.  It measured 37 feet from the tip of the forward elevator to the tail of the rudder.  Both the rudder and front elevator were double surfaced, or box-type, with the rudder being enclosed by a pair of two foot square vertical wings on either side of the horizontal surface.  There was no elevator function to the tail.  The tail and elevator surfaces measured approximately two feet by six feet and were set much farther out from the wings than a normal Curtiss.  Unlike the Harkness airplane, however, this Silver Dart was powered by the first production 40&nbsp;hp, four-cylinder Hall-Scott engine which turned an eight-foot propeller.<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Aviator Falls 100 Feet In Biplane; Uninjured |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:April_14,_1911_Walsh_Fails_Pilots_License.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Macomber Rotary Aeroplane Motors |url=http://earlyaviators.com/ewalsh4.htm |website=Charles F.

He continued on a very busy schedule for the rest of the year.\n\nFor Walsh, 1912 began by making flights over [[Havana]], Cuba, on New Years Day.  His demonstration flights in that city included flying the first woman passenger in Cuba.  He spent the rest of January on a very busy tour throughout Texas. His flying soon became influenced by [[Lincoln Beachy]].

Walsh. When he was a young boy, the family moved to nearby [[San Diego, California]]. Growing up, he worked in his father's grocery store.  Enterprising even at an early age, he started his own bicycle business as a teenager, but this would be the first of several unsuccessful ventures for Walsh until his early thirties.  In 1901, at the age of 24, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles and took a job as a [[stationary engineer]] at the California General Hospital in [[Los Angeles]]. It was there that he met a young nursing student named Alice Connolly.  They were married on September 23, 1903.\n\nIn January 1904, he and his new wife moved to [[Winslow, Arizona]], where he went to work for the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] as a freight train engineer.  Charles grew impatient during what turned out to be a long and frustrating apprenticeship, so he moved back to Los Angeles to work in an oil refinery as a field engineer.  It was not long, however, before they ventured to [[Goldfield, Nevada]], to seek their share of the gold fortune believed to be there.  At first, the Walshes were able to make decent money supporting the blossoming mining industry of the town.  The couple did return to Los Angeles in the spring of 1905 to give birth to their son Kenneth, while Charles briefly returned to work in the oil fields.  They returned to Goldfield a short time later.  Alice gave birth to a daughter (Juanita) there the following year.  When Goldfield died a quick death in 1907, however, a financially troubled Walsh was forced to move his family into his father's house at 17th and K streets in San Diego.\n\nCharles found work as an elevator operator in a local hotel.  Walsh became fascinated with aviation from reading about the subject in the local newspapers. Using only pictures from these newspapers, he sketched his own airplane design in between elevator trips at work and was determined to fly it one day.  In 1909, Walsh convinced a small group of local investors to open the first airplane manufacturing company in California.<ref name=Matt2000>Matt, P. R. (n.d.). Charles Francis Walsh (K. C. Rust, Ed.).

Walsh was vice president and general manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=The San Diego Aeroplane Manufacturing Company, Inc. |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-09-25_7.pdf}}</ref> He built his airplane in the old Rogers carriage shop on Third Street (between E and F Streets) near the company headquarters.<ref>{{cite web |title=On Exhibit |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-10-26_14.pdf}}</ref>  This location is now a parking garage for the [[Westfield Horton Plaza]].\n\nBy late November, Walsh had essentially completed his airplane.  Built from seasoned spruce and piano wire it measured 40 feet long with a 50-foot wingspan.  It was reported to be the largest monoplane in the world at the time.  Like the Wright Brothers design, a motor drove twin pusher propellers through a bicycle chain.  The propellers were seven feet long and made of Oregon pine with hickory hubs.  Like Curtiss, he used a tricycle type landing gear and ailerons vice the Wright's wing warping method for lateral control of his Bleriot-type monoplane.  His wings tapered from curved in the middle to flat ends.  The reason given for this is that the newspaper picture he used as his template for the design had the ends of the wings cutoff, so that is how he thought they looked.  Attached to these was his specially designed device to automatically provide lateral stability to his airplane.  This consisted of a fifteen-pound weight suspended from a five-foot rod which was connected to both wingtips.  As air flow acted on the wings, the weight would act as to raise on wingtip and lower the other, maintaining lateral stability without pilot input.  For control, Walsh designed a dual lever system, closely resembling that of the Wright Brothers.  One controlled the engine and one controlled the pitch. It was powered by a 30 H. P. Cameron automobile engine.<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Inventor Will Fly Worlds Largest Monoplane |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-11-21_7.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWalsh tested his airplane at the [[Coronado Island]] Country Club racetrack during the last week of December.  He was one of three local San Diego aviators, including [[Waldo Waterman]], attempting to enter an airplane in the [[1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field]].  The airplane was damaged during ground runs at Coronado on December 29.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Aviators Have Usual Trouble |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1909-12-31_6_(1).pdf}}</ref>  His wife Alice sold her jewelry so that he could attend the event as a spectator.  While there, he made the most of the opportunity to learn about airplane design from the most legendary pioneers in aviation.  When it was decided that San Diego would host its own air meet immediately following the one in Los Angeles, Walsh hurried home to incorporate what he learned into his own design as he rebuilt his airplane ahead of the event.<ref>Morehouse, H. E. (n.d.). Unpublished manuscript, Harold E. Morehouse Flying Pioneers Biographies collection, National Air and Space Museum Archives</ref>\n\nHe shortened his wingspan by approximately five feet, shortened the front elevator support assembly by ten feet, and added a \"horizontal plane\" over the rear rudder.  He also removed one of his rear rudders and abandoned his problematic chain-drive, dual-propeller configuration for a single-propeller, direct-drive system.  Walsh ordered a new six-foot propeller and intended to purchase one from [[Charles K. Hamilton]] upon his arrival at Coronado for the 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet.  All of this yielded a 100-pound savings in weight and better controllability.  His Cameron engine was raised two feet above the lower level of the main frame and produced 2000 rpm.<ref>{{cite web |title=$1000 Added to Aviation Prize |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:January_22_1910(Coronado).pdf}}</ref>\n\n===1910 San Diego Aviation Meet===\nDuring the [[1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field]], Charles K. Hamilton was invited by some San Diego businessmen to come to [[Coronado Island]] and attempt to beat the altitude record that [[Louis Paulhan]] set during that meet.  For the people of San Diego, the event was about attracting aviation to San Diego and raising money for the [[Panama-California Exposition]] the city planned to host in 1915.  [[Glenn Curtiss]] was in search of a suitable location for a winter headquarters and asked Hamilton to scout out San Diego for him.  He loaned Hamilton his [[Curtiss No. 2]] \"Reims Racer\" for this purpose.  The 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet was scheduled for January 23\u201325.  Charles F. Walsh was guaranteed the first $500 in profits to demonstrate his airplane on the opening day of the meet.<ref>Jackrabbits to jets: the history of Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, California Elretta Sudsbury - San Diego Pub. Co. - 1992</ref>  Walsh destroyed his airplane during his demonstration on the opening day of the meet when he was forced to taxi his airplane into a fence to avoid hitting Hamilton and the Reims Racer.  Two days later, Hamilton took Walsh along for a flight as a passenger in the Reims Racer.  This was the first flight for Walsh.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hamilton Wrecks Biplane in the Last Flight of Meet |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-01-26_6.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur aviation career==\n===Imperial Beach, California===\nFollowing the San Diego Aviation Meet, Walsh built a new airplane in less than 30 days.<ref name=SDUnionJune2>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walsh_crash,_June_1910.pdf]</ref>  He was invited by a San Diego developer named E W Peterson to move his airplane to nearby Imperial Beach, California.  Peterson had three 30-foot-wide by 600-foot-long runways graded for this purpose.  Around April 1, 1910, Walsh began developing an aviation camp there while testing his new airplane.  The plane was a nearly exact copy of the Reims Racer in which he had flown as a passenger with Charles K. Hamilton.  Walsh added features of his own design that he hoped would simplify controllability, however.  Instead of a shoulder yoke for lateral control, Walsh mounted the steering wheel to a post on a double hinge, allowing for dual-axis control to operate the ailerons in addition to the elevators via a wire connection to the ailerons from the base of the control yoke. The engine-shutoff and starting wheel brake were controlled by a single lever fastened directly over the left side of the foot rest.  The same motion of the foot-operated both devices.  The engine speed lever was still connected to the frame next to the pilot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roehrig Biplane Is Nearly Ready For Its First Tryout |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-04-08_19.pdf}}</ref>  A day or two later, Walsh added a thrust bearing to his engine, yielding an additional 25% increase in speed.  On April 10, 1910, approximately 100 onlookers witnessed his first flight.  Reaching an altitude of 15\u201320 feet, he flew for approximately 400 feet over the Imperial Beach runway before executing a reportedly flawless landing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walsh In His New Biplane Flies 400 feet on Beach |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-04-11_8.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy late May, he had already turned down offers to perform during the Fourth of July celebration of Baker City, Oregon; St. Louis, Missouri; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The personal expense to him for such long distance trips made him concentrate on opportunities closer to San Diego.  He also made significant improvements to his airplane by this time, adding steel-rimmed wheels for his landing gear and installing a more advanced propeller.  To compensate for the aft center of gravity resulting from the increased weight of his engine relative to the one that powered the Reims Racer that he faithfully modeled his airplane after, he modified his tail to a box design, vice the single elevator.<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Aviator Is Sought By Promoters of 3 Cities |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-05-25_5.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, Walsh suffered a major setback when his airplane crashed following a steep turn during a practice run on the aviation course.  It was quickly determined that his engine could not provide sufficient thrust to maintain altitude at steep angles of bank.  While this accident almost convinced Walsh to abandon aviation altogether, fellow Imperial Beach aviator B F Roehrig began an effort to raise money for a better engine.  He had made over 40 flights at this point. Most were straight and level below 50&nbsp;ft covering distances of 100 to 1000 feet as he gained confidence in himself and his airplane.<ref name=\"SDUnionJune2\" />  On the Fourth of July, he performed three aerial demonstrations at Imperial Beach before a crowd of 300\u2013400 curious onlookers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walsh Celebrates Fourth in Mid-Air |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Union_1910-07-07_3.pdf}}</ref>  Later that month, Walsh acquired a more powerful 40&nbsp;hp Elbridge engine, which he rented from another San Diego aviation hopeful.

According to the local newspaper covering the event, Walsh did not own any interest in the plane.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aviator Flies Here |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walsh_Sues_Manager_Newspaper_Article.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Curtiss Exhibition Company===\n\nFollowing the [[1911 Chicago International Aviation Meet]], Walsh became a contract demonstration pilot with the Curtiss Exhibition Company.<ref>{{cite web |title=CURTISS EXHIBITION COMPANY |url=http://www.earlyaviators.com/ewalsh7.htm |website=earlyaviators.com}}</ref>  On August 31, 1911, he reportedly flew his newly assigned 75&nbsp;hp Curtiss pusher for the first time at [[Sterling, Illinois]], without incident, followed by an event in Iowa.<ref>Proves That Man Can At Last Fly Sterling Gazette, 31 Aug. 1911, pp. 1\u20135.</ref>  Walsh then returned to Nebraska, performing aerial demonstrations until the first week of October.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Birdman at the Fair |url=https://history.nebraska.gov/blog/birdman-fair |website=History Nebraska Blog |publisher=History Nebraska |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>      \nOn October 12, crowds gathered at Traction Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to watch Walsh become the first pilot to fly over the Rio Grande Valley.  The [[Albuquerque International Sunport]] has a 1914 Curtiss-style pusher representative of the one flown by Walsh on display in the terminal which helps commemorate the event.  He continued on a very busy schedule for the rest of the year.\n\nFor Walsh, 1912 began by making flights over [[Havana]], Cuba, on New Years Day.  His demonstration flights in that city included flying the first woman passenger in Cuba.  He spent the rest of January on a very busy tour throughout Texas. His flying soon became influenced by [[Lincoln Beachy]]. He crashed and died on October 3, 1912, in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and was buried in [[Calvary Cemetery, San Diego]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Aviator Walsh |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w6deAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bFMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6382,1965077&dq=charles+walsh+aviator&hl=en |quote=Charles Walsh, the aviator, who appeared in Portsmouth last June and gave exhibition flights with his aeroplane, starting from the Portsmouth Driving park, was instantly killed last Thursday ... at Trenton, New Jersey ... |newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times]] |date=October 4, 1912 |accessdate=2013-04-07 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n*[http://www.earlyaviators.com/ewalsh.htm Charles Francis Walsh] at [[Early Aviators]]\n*[http://www.deford.com/walsh/ Image gallery]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walsh, Charles Francis}}\n[[Category:1877 births]]\n[[Category:1912 deaths]]\n[[Category:American aviators]]\n[[Category:People from San Diego County, California]]\n[[Category:People from Winslow, Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "Gildir", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:: +Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Walsh"}
