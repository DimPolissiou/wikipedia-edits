It is the headquarters of the [[Bidar District|Bidar]] district which borders [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider ''Bidar Metropolitan area''. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance.\n\nBeing located at the farthest of around {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Bengaluru]], it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the [[Deccan plateau]], the [[Bidar fort]] is more than 500 years old and still standing strong.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar fort stands the test of time|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/44855/bidar-fort-stands-test-time.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=4 January 2010}}</ref> According to the book \"Bidar Heritage\" published by the state ''Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage'', of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are [[tombs]] located in and around Bidar city.,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar has 30 tombs of former kings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bidar-has-30-tombs-of-former-kings/article1308928.ece|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=6 August 2008}}</ref> explaining its nickname, \"City of Whispering Monuments\".

This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.\n\n== Etymology ==\nBidar is believed to have got its name from ''Bidri works''.\n\nLegend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of [[Vidarbha]], to which references are found in early Hindu literature like ''[[Malavikagnimitra]], [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]]'', and a few other ''[[Puranas]]''.{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=3}}{{rp|3}}  Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names ''Bidar'' and ''Vidarbha''. This has been mentioned in [[Firishta|Firishta's]] writings.\n\nThe traditional tales reveal that [[Vidura]] lived here; hence the place was earlier called '''Viduranagara''' and also as the place where [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]] (Daughter of ''Raja Bhima'', the King of Vidharba) were meeting.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite book|title=Karnataka Gazetteer|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Govt. of Karnataka|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\nBidar under the rule of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was known as Muhammadabad.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Bidar}}\nThe recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. After the Mauryas, [[Satavahana]]s, [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]]s, and [[Chalukya]]s of Badami and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the sevunas of Devgiri and [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]].\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by [[Allauddin Khilji]], and later, [[Muhammad Tughlaq|Muhammed-bin-Tughluq]] took control of entire [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of [[Bahamani|Bahmanid Dynasty]] in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present [[Kalaburagi]]). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the [[Vijaynagar Empire|Vijaynagar Kingdom]].<ref>http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html</ref>\n\nThe history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land.  The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/heritage/heritage_areas.htm | title=Heritage Areas}}</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422\u20131486), Bidar was made the capital city of [[Bahmani Kingdom]].{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=5}}<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> The old fort was rebuilt and [[madrasa]]s, [[mosques]], palaces, and gardens were raised. [[Mahmud Gawan]], who became the [[Prime Minister]] in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Barid Shahi]] dynasty until conquest by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] in 1619.\n[[Aurangazeb|Aurangzeb]] came to Bidar after his father, [[Padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], appointed him the Prince of Deccan.

The volume of water filtered during the [[monsoons]] through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the [[cliffs]] of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a [[rift]] is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a [[ravine]], and the ravine expands into a [[Valley|vale]].\n\nThe [[Karez System]] is built along a [[geological fracture]]. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of [[laterite]] and [[Basalt|basalt rocks]] and form lineaments or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] that yield water.<ref>{{cite news|title=A thrilling walk through medieval waterways|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-thrilling-walk-through-medieval-waterways/article6556625.ece|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Bidar district#Laterite}}\n\n=== Soil ===\nBidar soils are deep (&gt;100&nbsp;cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites.

It is the headquarters of the [[Bidar District|Bidar]] district which borders [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider ''Bidar Metropolitan area''. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance.\n\nBeing located at the farthest of around {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Bengaluru]], it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the [[Deccan plateau]], the [[Bidar fort]] is more than 500 years old and still standing strong.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar fort stands the test of time|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/44855/bidar-fort-stands-test-time.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=4 January 2010}}</ref> According to the book \"Bidar Heritage\" published by the state ''Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage'', of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are [[tombs]] located in and around Bidar city.,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar has 30 tombs of former kings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bidar-has-30-tombs-of-former-kings/article1308928.ece|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=6 August 2008}}</ref> explaining its nickname, \"City of Whispering Monuments\".

This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.\n\n== Etymology ==\nBidar is believed to have got its name from ''Bidri works''.\n\nLegend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of [[Vidarbha]], to which references are found in early Hindu literature like ''[[Malavikagnimitra]], [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]]'', and a few other ''[[Puranas]]''.{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=3}}{{rp|3}}  Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names ''Bidar'' and ''Vidarbha''. This has been mentioned in [[Firishta|Firishta's]] writings.\n\nThe traditional tales reveal that [[Vidura]] lived here; hence the place was earlier called '''Viduranagara''' and also as the place where [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]] (Daughter of ''Raja Bhima'', the King of Vidharba) were meeting.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite book|title=Karnataka Gazetteer|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Govt. of Karnataka|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\nBidar under the rule of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was known as Muhammadabad.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Bidar}}\nThe recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. After the Mauryas, [[Satavahana]]s, [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]]s, and [[Chalukya]]s of Badami and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the sevunas of Devgiri and [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]].\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by [[Allauddin Khilji]], and later, [[Muhammad Tughlaq|Muhammed-bin-Tughluq]] took control of entire [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of [[Bahamani|Bahmanid Dynasty]] in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present [[Kalaburagi]]). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the [[Vijaynagar Empire|Vijaynagar Kingdom]].<ref>http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html</ref>\n\nThe history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land.  The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/heritage/heritage_areas.htm | title=Heritage Areas}}</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422\u20131486), Bidar was made the capital city of [[Bahmani Kingdom]].{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=5}}<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> The old fort was rebuilt and [[madrasa]]s, [[mosques]], palaces, and gardens were raised. [[Mahmud Gawan]], who became the [[Prime Minister]] in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Barid Shahi]] dynasty until conquest by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] in 1619.\n[[Aurangazeb|Aurangzeb]] came to Bidar after his father, [[Padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], appointed him the Prince of Deccan.

This crust varies in depth from {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the [[monsoons]] through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the [[cliffs]] of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a [[rift]] is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a [[ravine]], and the ravine expands into a [[Valley|vale]].\n\nThe [[Karez System]] is built along a [[geological fracture]]. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of [[laterite]] and [[Basalt|basalt rocks]] and form lineaments or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] that yield water.<ref>{{cite news|title=A thrilling walk through medieval waterways|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-thrilling-walk-through-medieval-waterways/article6556625.ece|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Bidar district#Laterite}}\n\n=== Soil ===\nBidar soils are deep (&gt;100&nbsp;cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites.

Bidar is one of the coldest cities (by southern standards) in Karnataka as the minimum temperature during winter nights regularly hovers around 11-12 during December, which is the coldest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 27.3 C and mean daily minimum of 13.4 C. From the middle of the February, both day and night temperatures begin to rise rapidly. May is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 38.8 C and mean daily minimum of 25.9 C.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

However, after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with [[United Airlines]]. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue's Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]. Virgin Blue also has an Interline Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia, and operates its own two routes with [[Virgin Australia Regional Airlines]] in Western Australia.

Beaches which have aircraft named after them include [[Cable Beach]], [[Cottesloe Beach]] and [[Bondi Beach]].

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling.

Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42\u201343}}\n[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]\nInquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/>\n\n===Vocalisations===\nRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five [[octave]]s, which grade into each other.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}} Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> The majority of sounds can be divided into \"contact\" and \"interaction\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n*'''Contact calls:''' The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \"''wow wow wow''\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of [[tawny owl]]s). The \"''wow wow wow''\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \"''wow wow wow''\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n*'''Interaction calls:''' When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], called \"gekkering\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n[[File:Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (W1CDR0001529 BD12).ogg|thumb|left|Fox barks, UK, January 1977]]\n\nAnother call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \"''waaaaah''\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet, hunting & feeding behaviour hey y'all===\n[[File:Red fox with nutria.jpg|thumb|Red fox with [[coypu]]]]\nRed foxes are [[omnivore]]s with a highly varied diet.

Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Alexander Archipelago]] during the 1830s\u20131930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866.<ref name=rwf1987/> Where they are [[sympatry|sympatric]], Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on [[lemming]]s and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Red foxes are serious competitors of [[corsac fox]]es, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents.

Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites.<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> [[Grey fox]]es are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/>\n\n[[Gray wolf|Wolves]] may kill and eat red foxes in disputes over carcasses.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/><ref name=\"Mech 2003\">{{cite book |author1=Mech, L.

Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes.

In [[London]], [[arthritis]] is common in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> Foxes may be infected with [[leptospirosis]] and [[tularemia]], though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from [[listeriosis]] and [[intestinal spirochetosis|spirochetosis]], as well as acting as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] in spreading [[erysipelas]], [[brucellosis]] and tick-borne [[encephalitis]]. A mysterious fatal disease near [[Lake Sartlan]] in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of [[encephalomyelitis]], which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' are known.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nRed foxes are not readily prone to infestation with [[flea]]s. Species like ''[[Spilopsyllus cuniculi]]'' are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like ''[[Archaeopsylla erinacei]]'' are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include ''[[Pulex irritans]]'', ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Paraceras melis]]''. [[Tick]]s such as ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' and ''[[Ixodes hexagonus|I.&nbsp;hexagonus]]'' are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The [[louse]] ''[[Trichodectes vulpis]]'' specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' is the most important cause of [[mange]] in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the [[epizootic]] phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'', ''[[Notoderes]]'', ''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'' (which is frequently found in the [[ear canal]]), ''[[Linguatula serrata]]'' (which infects the nasal passages) and [[ringworm]]s.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nUp to 60 [[helminth]] species are known to infect foxes in [[fur farm]]s, while 20 are known in the wild.

[[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name=\"potts\">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name=\"potts\"/>\n\n{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement.

Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166\u2013167}}\n\nRed foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180\u2013181}}\n\n===Taming and domestication===\n{{Further|Domesticated red fox}}\n[[File:A tame fox cub at home with Mr and Mrs Gordon Jones, Talysarn (4478261667).jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs Jones' son, Heddwyn, sitting on the kitchen table holding the cub]]\nIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jones, Lucy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/why-we-love-keeping-foxes-at-home---despite-the-smell/ |title=Why we love keeping foxes at home - despite the smell |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young.

Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included [[piebald]] coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trut, Lyudmila N. |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131052/http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 February 2010 |title=Early canid domestication: The farm-fox experiment |journal=American Scientist |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=160\u2013169 |doi=10.1511/1999.20.813}}</ref>\n\n===Urban foxes===\n====Distribution====\nRed foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name=\"z132\"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside.

The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering [[Bristol]] and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]]. In Ireland they are now common in suburban [[Dublin]]. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in [[Melbourne]] as early as the 1930s, while in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, they only started appearing in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html |title=Urban foxes: Overview |publisher=The fox website |accessdate=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916075909/http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html# |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing.

In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.\n\n====Behaviour====\nUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Urban fox control====\nUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/> In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method.<ref name=Fieldsportschannel>{{cite web|title=Fieldsports Britain: How to call in great big bucks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3doTc9A31Y|publisher=Fieldsports Channel |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====\nIn January 2014 it was reported that \"Fleet\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county.

Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the [[Sexual behavior of wolves|burrows of wolves]], porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40\u201345\u00b0) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from {{convert|0.5|\u2013|2.5|m}}, rarely extending to [[ground water]]. The main passage can reach {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} in length, standing an average of {{convert|5|\u2013|7|m|abbr=on}}. In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may share their dens with woodchucks<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> or badgers.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.<ref name=\"dale\"/>{{rp|15\u201317}}> The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.<ref name=\"Holland 2011\">{{cite journal |author=Holland, Jennifer S. |title=40 winks? |journal=National Geographic |volume=220 |issue=1 |date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n===Body language===\n[[File:Lis (Vulpes vulpes) WOB.JPG|thumb|left|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an inquisitive posture]]\n[[File:Fox study 6.jpg|thumb|right|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an alert posture]]\nRed fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42\u201343}}\n[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]\nInquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/>\n\n===Vocalisations===\nRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five [[octave]]s, which grade into each other.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}} Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> The majority of sounds can be divided into \"contact\" and \"interaction\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n*'''Contact calls:''' The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \"''wow wow wow''\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of [[tawny owl]]s). The \"''wow wow wow''\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \"''wow wow wow''\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n*'''Interaction calls:''' When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], called \"gekkering\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n[[File:Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (W1CDR0001529 BD12).ogg|thumb|left|Fox barks, UK, January 1977]]\n\nAnother call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \"''waaaaah''\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet, hunting and feeding behaviour===\n[[File:Red fox with nutria.jpg|thumb|Red fox with [[coypu]]]]\nRed foxes are [[omnivore]]s with a highly varied diet.

Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Alexander Archipelago]] during the 1830s\u20131930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866.<ref name=rwf1987/> Where they are [[sympatry|sympatric]], Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on [[lemming]]s and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes.

The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents.

Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites.<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> [[Grey fox]]es are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes.

In [[London]], [[arthritis]] is common in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> Foxes may be infected with [[leptospirosis]] and [[tularemia]], though they are not overly susceptible to the latter.

A mysterious fatal disease near [[Lake Sartlan]] in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of [[encephalomyelitis]], which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' are known.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nRed foxes are not readily prone to infestation with [[flea]]s. Species like ''[[Spilopsyllus cuniculi]]'' are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like ''[[Archaeopsylla erinacei]]'' are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include ''[[Pulex irritans]]'', ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Paraceras melis]]''. [[Tick]]s such as ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' and ''[[Ixodes hexagonus|I.&nbsp;hexagonus]]'' are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The [[louse]] ''[[Trichodectes vulpis]]'' specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' is the most important cause of [[mange]] in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the [[epizootic]] phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'', ''[[Notoderes]]'', ''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'' (which is frequently found in the [[ear canal]]), ''[[Linguatula serrata]]'' (which infects the nasal passages) and [[ringworm]]s.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nUp to 60 [[helminth]] species are known to infect foxes in [[fur farm]]s, while 20 are known in the wild.

[[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name=\"potts\">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name=\"potts\"/>\n\n{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement.

Their pelts are used for [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s, [[scarf]]s, [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]]s, [[jacket]]s and [[fur coat|coat]]s. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps.<ref name=\"bachrach\"/>{{rp|229\u2013230}} The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as [[cape]]s,<ref name=\"bachrach\"/>{{rp|246}} while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming.<ref name=\"bachrach\"/>{{rp|252}} The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers.

Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins.<ref name=\"bachrach\"/>{{rp|231}} Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties.

Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166\u2013167}}\n\nRed foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180\u2013181}}\n\n===Taming and domestication===\n{{Further|Domesticated red fox}}\n[[File:A tame fox cub at home with Mr and Mrs Gordon Jones, Talysarn (4478261667).jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs Jones' son, Heddwyn, sitting on the kitchen table holding the cub]]\nIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jones, Lucy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/why-we-love-keeping-foxes-at-home---despite-the-smell/ |title=Why we love keeping foxes at home - despite the smell |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young.

Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included [[piebald]] coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trut, Lyudmila N. |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131052/http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 February 2010 |title=Early canid domestication: The farm-fox experiment |journal=American Scientist |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=160\u2013169 |doi=10.1511/1999.20.813}}</ref>\n\n===Urban foxes===\n====Distribution====\nRed foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name=\"z132\"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering [[Bristol]] and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]]. In Ireland they are now common in suburban [[Dublin]]. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in [[Melbourne]] as early as the 1930s, while in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, they only started appearing in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html |title=Urban foxes: Overview |publisher=The fox website |accessdate=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916075909/http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html# |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing.

In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.\n\n====Behaviour====\nUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Urban fox control====\nUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/> In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method.<ref name=Fieldsportschannel>{{cite web|title=Fieldsports Britain: How to call in great big bucks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3doTc9A31Y|publisher=Fieldsports Channel |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====\nIn January 2014 it was reported that \"Fleet\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the [[GPS]] collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01qfhsb |title=BBC Two - Winterwatch, Urban Fox Diary: Part 2 |website=BBC |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-25840467 |title=Fleet the Sussex fox breaks British walking record |website=BBC |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Red fox crossing road.jpg|Red fox crossing a street in Portugal\nFile:Flickr - Duncan~ - Fox Trot.jpg|Red fox in central London\nFile:Fox with food bag.jpg|Eating from a bag of biscuits in Dorset, England\nFile:Fleet Fox AKA Rolf, Winterwatch Brighton.png|\"Fleet\" the urban fox from the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]''\nFile:Red Fox eating KFC.webm|Fox with discarded [[KFC]] bag\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal|last1=Osborn|first1=Dale.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]]. In 1958, she graduated from Townville High School at age eighteen.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} \n\nInstead of attending college, Seely took a job at the Titusville Trust Company as a [[stenographer]].

One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and she was forced to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Music career==\n===1961\u20131965: Move to California and early songwriting===\nIn 1961, Seely made the decision to move to southern California.

Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre. In a 2017 interview, Seely explained how she acquired the nickname. \"...as I left the radio station he\u2019d visited, the disc jockey played my record 'Don\u2019t Touch Me' and he back-announced it saying \u2018that\u2019s the blue-eyed soul of Miss Country Soul Jeannie Seely\u2019 and Ed really liked the sound and the feel of that and it so it kinda stuck,\" she commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview with Country Legend Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.grizzlyrose.com/interview-jeannie-seely/ |website=Grizzly Rose |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeely's voice has also been of interest to writers and critics when discussing her artistry.

Oermann considered Seely to be an example of the \"heartache/victim singers\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Bufwack and Oermann compared her voice to that of [[Connie Smith]], Dottie West and [[Tammy Wynette]]. \"Jeannie's husky cigarette-stained voice moaned with such agony that she was dubbed 'Miss Country Soul'\", they wrote.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Other journalists had differed opinions. Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country.

Prior to Seely, many female country performers entertained in [[gingham|gingham]] and wore dresses on stage. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert K.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]].

Helen plays a devout Christian woman, and Jeannie plays a woman who is more, shall we say, morally diverse,\" he said.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Breegle |first1=Ryan |title=Riggan's hit musical 'Could It Be Love?' returns to Nashville |url=https://outandaboutnashville.com/riggans-hit-musical-could-it-be-love-returns-to-nashville/ |website=Out and About Nashville |date=September 2005 |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn 2002, Seely played a minor role in the film ''Changing Hearts'', which starred [[Faye Dunaway]].

In 1988, she published a book called ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. The book was a collection of witticisms Seely had written over the years.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=475}} According to Seely, many of the witticisms began as song titles that never materialized.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=7}} Other quotes were originally opening lines Seely used while performing on stage. Quotes in the book included, \"Of course I want you for your body.

She later posted updates about Ward's condition on her social media sites. \"His vitals are holding pretty steady and his breathing is much improved.

Seely credited the help of local volunteers with putting her home back together a year later. \"Just about that time, there was a group of young people from Hardin Valley, just this side of [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], who were supposed to go to [[Jamaica]] but couldn't because there was too much violence there. So, they came here, and what a difference that group made. Those young people hit this place like a swarm of bees, they were cutting the weeds that were starting to grow, trimming the shrubbery, hauling out trash, digging up where the water had settled in the mulch,\" she said in a 2011 interview.<ref name=\"Floods\"/>\n\n==Artistry==\n===Musical styles and voice===\nSeely's musical style is mostly rooted in [[country music]]. However, it also is rooted in [[classic country]], [[country pop]] and [[blue-eyed soul]].<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/><ref name=\"Top 5\">{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Carrie |title=Top 5 Jeannie Seely Songs |url=https://theboot.com/top-5-jeannie-seely-songs/ |website=The Boot |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=300-02}} At times, her songs have dealt with women's sexuality, heartache, empowerment and loss.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}} ''The Boot'' writer Carrie Horton highlighted how Seely's music has focused on women's sexual desires. Horton noted that Seely's signature tune, \"Don't Touch\", was controversial due to its lyric. \"'Don't Touch Me' caused quite a stir upon its release as one of the first country songs featuring a woman expressing sexual desire. Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre. In a 2017 interview, Seely explained how she acquired the nickname. \"...as I left the radio station he\u2019d visited, the disc jockey played my record 'Don\u2019t Touch Me' and he back-announced it saying \u2018that\u2019s the blue-eyed soul of Miss Country Soul Jeannie Seely\u2019 and Ed really liked the sound and the feel of that and it so it kinda stuck,\" she commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview with Country Legend Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.grizzlyrose.com/interview-jeannie-seely/ |website=Grizzly Rose |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeely's voice has also been of interest to writers and critics when discussing her artistry. Some writers have noted the emotion in her vocal delivery. [[Ken Burns]] of [[PBS]] called Seely's voice \"emotion packed\" in his biography of her music and career.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> John Lupton of ''Country Standard Time'' called her voice \"distinctive and raspy\".<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann considered Seely to be an example of the \"heartache/victim singers\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Bufwack and Oermann compared her voice to that of [[Connie Smith]], Dottie West and [[Tammy Wynette]]. \"Jeannie's husky cigarette-stained voice moaned with such agony that she was dubbed 'Miss Country Soul'\", they wrote.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Other journalists had differed opinions. Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country. Nonetheless, he still considered her voice to be country. \"...today she seems like [[Kitty Wells]] compared to some of the pure pop that has since passed for country,\" Adams wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Thanks, Hank!'' -- Jeannie Seely -- Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thanks-hank%21-mw0000967234 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Image===\nAs a performer and entertainer, Seely's image has often been a subject of discussion. On the Grand Ole Opry, she became the first artist to wear a [[miniskirt]] on stage.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> In the PBS documentary, ''[[Country Music (miniseries)|Country Music]]'', Seely recalled having a confrontation with Opry manager Ott Devine following an early Opry performance. In his office, she convinced Devine to wear a miniskirt regularly. \"Okay, this is what America is wearing and I\u2019ll make you a deal. I won\u2019t wear a miniskirt in the back door if you don\u2019t let anybody wear one in the front door,\" she told him.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=''Country Music'' (The Sons and Daughters of America) |journal=[[PBS]] |date=September 2019}}</ref> Seely was also among the first female artists to wear other contemporary fashion items, including [[go-go boot]]s, [[pantsuit]]s and [[jeans|denim jeans]]. Prior to Seely, many female country performers entertained in [[gingham|gingham]] and wore dresses on stage. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely \"broke the Opry's gingham curtain\". Seely later reflected on her choice of stage attire. \"I never planned to set any sort of trend. I'm about like any other normal American girl my age. I think I dress and act pretty much the way she does,\" she recalled.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jeannie Seely discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Award program''' || '''Award''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Billboard magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Record World|Record World magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1967 || [[Grammy Awards]] || ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\" || Won\n|-\n| 1972 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with [[Jack Greene]]) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1973 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1974 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1975 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 2017 || R.O.P.E || ''Entertainer of the Year'' (with [[Gene Watson]]) || Won\n|}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Oermann |first1=Robert K. |last2=Bufwack |first2=Mary A. |title=Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music: 1800\u20132000 |date=2003 |publisher=The Country Music Press & Vanderbilt University Press |location=Nashville, TN |isbn=0-8265-1432-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/findinghervoicew0000bufw|ref={{SfnRef|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003}} }}\n* {{cite web |author1=Seely, Jeannie |author2= Harman, Ron|year=2002|url=http://jeannieseely.com/docs/Jeannie%20Seely%20Full%20Length%20Bio.pdf|title=Biography|work=Jeannie Seely.com|accessdate=April 10, 2020|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Trott |first1=Walt |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-517608-7|ref={{SfnRef|Trott, Walt|2012}} }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.jeannieseely.com/}}\n* [http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/seely_jeannie/artist.jhtml Jeannie Seely at CMT.com]\n\n{{Jeannie Seely}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry members}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seely, Jeannie}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American female country singers]]\n[[Category:American record producers]]\n[[Category:Challenge Records artists]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Decca Records artists]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Grand Ole Opry members]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Monument Records artists]]\n[[Category:People from Titusville, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "ChrisTofu11961", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1990\u2013present: Return to recording:fixed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Seely"}
