Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

He is, for example, only an invisible force destroying evil and chaos in some texts {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}, and portrayed as someone leading an army of warriors in some.

This proposal is supported by two versions of ''Mahabharata'' manuscripts (e.g. the G3.6 manuscript) that have been found, where the Sanskrit verses name the avatar to be \"karki\", rather than \"kalki\".<ref name=\"Brockington1998p287\" />\n\n==Description==\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nKalki is an avatar of Vishnu. Avatar means \"descent\" and refers to a descent of the divine into the material realm of human existence.

At 3:12, during a McGregor combination, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, [[Nick Diaz]], termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor avoided Diaz's jabs by slipping to his right, often before throwing his left overhand. The second round commenced with Diaz using his check right hook, attempting to keep the aggressive McGregor at distance. Despite this, McGregor had success with his bodywork, landing a left hook to Diaz's right side at 0:37. McGregor began to connect with combinations, until Diaz clinched and pushed McGregor to the fence, at 1:15. After a combination of uppercuts from McGregor at 1:48, Diaz delivered his first significant taunt of the fight, shrugging towards his opponent. At 3:47, McGregor attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], Diaz successfully [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]] to avoid the shot. Diaz, hands clasped around McGregor's neck, threatening the [[guillotine choke]], forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling out of the position as he had during the bout with [[Chad Mendes]] at [[UFC 189]]. At 4:00, Diaz secured the [[mount (grappling)|mount]], before firing off a volley of strikes from the top. In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, allowing Diaz to punch his head into the crook of his arm, and secure a [[rear naked choke]]. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round, forcing referee [[Herb Dean]] to intervene and stop the bout.<ref name=\"SherdogArticle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-196-Results-McGregor-vs-Diaz-PlaybyPlay-Updates-101235#conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz|title=UFC 196 Results: 'McGregor vs. Diaz' Play-by-Play & Updates|last1=Breen|first1=Jordan|last2=Critchfield|first2=Tristen|date=5 March 2016|website=Sherdog|last3=Nelson|first3=Chris}}</ref><ref name=\"MetricMvD\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fightmetric.com/fight-details/4ace70bff9debdfb|title=UFC 196: McGregor vs Diaz|publisher=Fight Metric}}</ref><ref name=\"JackSlack\">{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/death-of-a-southpaw-how-conor-mcgregor-lost-to-nate-diaz|title=Death of a Southpaw: How Conor McGregor Lost to Nate Diaz|last=Slack|first=Jack|date=7 March 2016|publisher=Fightland}}</ref> Both competitors were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company, a total of $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/03/ufc-196-results-nate-diaz-shocks-conor-mcgregor-with-second-round-choke|title=UFC 196 results: Nate Diaz shocks Conor McGregor with second-round choke|publisher=mmajunkie.com|first=Steven|last=Marrocco|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/blogs/mma/mcgregor-gets-a-record-1m-purse-at-ufc-196/|title=McGregor gets a record $1M purse at UFC 196|work=Sportsnet.ca}}</ref>\n\n=====Rematch with Nate Diaz=====\nA rematch with Diaz was scheduled for 9 July at [[UFC 200]];
