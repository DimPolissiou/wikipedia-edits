It was a low-wing, [[trimotor]] [[monoplane]] of mixed metal and wood construction with a retractable [[Conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]]. It was the last of a line of transport aeroplanes that [[Alessandro Marchetti (aircraft engineer)|Alessandro Marchetti]] began building in the early 1930s. The SM.75 was fast, robust, capable of long-range flight and could carry up to 24 passengers for 1,000 miles.<ref name=\"Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207\">Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207.</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===SM.75 and SM.75''bis''===\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.75.jpg|thumb|Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]]\nThe SM.75 was designed in response to an enquiry from the Italian [[airline]] [[Ala Littoria]], which was seeking a modern, middle-to-long-range [[airliner]] and [[cargo aircraft]] as a replacement for its [[Savoia-Marchetti S.73]] aircraft. In his design of the SM.75, Savoia-Marchetti chief designer Alessandro Marchetti (1884\u20131966) retained the general configuration of the S.73 but introduced retractable main [[landing gear]] to reduce [[aerodynamic drag]]. The SM.75{{'}}s airframe consisted of a steel-tube frame with fabric and [[plywood]] covering, and its control surfaces were plywood-covered. The SM.75 had a four-man crew, and its cabin was built to accommodate up to 25 passengers. Its short take-off run of 337 metres (1,105 feet) and shorter landing distance of 280 metres (919&nbsp;feet) meant that it could operate from short [[runway]]s on secondary [[airfield]]s.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\">Rosselli, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe SM.75 was powered by three [[Alfa Romeo 126]] RC.34 [[radial engine]]s rated at 559 [[kilowatt]]s (750 [[horsepower]]) each at 3,400 meters (11,155 feet). Eleven aircraft fitted with three Alfa Romeo 126 RC.18 14-cylinder engines rated at 641 [[kilowatt]]s (860 horsepower) at 1,800 metres (5,905 feet) were designated the '''SM.75''bis'''''.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) showed solid interest in the SM.75, resulting in the development of a militarized version. This lacked windows in the passenger cabin but was fitted with a reinforced panel to permit the installation of a dorsal [[gun turret]]. It was powered by three [[Alfa Romeo 125|Alfa Romeo 128 RC.21]] engines and had a greater cargo capacity than the SM.75, and entered military service as the '''[[Savoia-Marchetti SM.82]]'''.\n\n===SM.76===\n\nThe Italian airline [[LATI (airline)|LATI]] received its first SM.75 in 1939. The aircraft was redesignated as the '''SM.76''' in 1940.\n\n===SM.87===\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.87.jpg|thumb|left|Savoia-Marchetti SM.87 [[float plane]].]]\nIn 1939, a [[floatplane]] version of the SM.75 appeared. Known as the '''SM.87''', it was powered by three 746&nbsp;kW (1,000&nbsp;hp) [[Fiat A.80]] engines. It could reach a speed of 365&nbsp;km/h (227&nbsp;mph) and had a ceiling of 6,250&nbsp;m (20,510&nbsp;ft), a range of {{convert|2,200|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and a crew of four, and could accommodate 24 passengers. Four were built.\n\n===SM.90===\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.90.jpg|thumb|left|Savoia-Marchetti SM.90.]]\nThe '''SM.90''' was a version of the SM.75 fitted with more powerful 1,044&nbsp;kW (1,400&nbsp;hp) [[Alfa Romeo 135|Alfa Romeo 135 R.C.32]] engines. It had a longer [[fuselage]] than the SM.75. Only one was built.\n\n===SM.75GA===\nThe SM.75 GA (for ''Grande Autonomia'', meaning \"Long Range\") was a modification of the SM.75 powered by three 641&nbsp;kW (860&nbsp;hp) [[Alfa Romeo 125|Alfa Romeo 128]] engines and fitted as well as a powerful radio and auxiliary fuel tanks to boost the aircraft{{'}}s range to 7,000 kilometers (4,350 statute miles) with a 1,100-[[kilogram]] (2,430-[[Pound (weight)|pound]]) load. With a four- or five-man crew and a 200-kilogram (441-pound) load, the SM.75 GA could achieve a range of 8,005 kilometers (4,971 statute miles) at 298 kilometers per hour (185 miles per hour) flying at altitudes between 3,500 and 5,000 meters (11,483 and 16,404 feet).<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Italian commercial service===\n\nThe SM.75 first flew in November 1937 from [[Novara]], in [[Piedmont]]. It entered commercial service with Ala Littoria in 1938 and with LATI in 1939, and was employed on services both within [[Europe]] and to [[South America]], as well as on the [[Rome]]-[[Addis Ababa]] route established after the Italian invasion\u2014and later conquest\u2014of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. The SM.75 proved easily capable of carrying a crew of four and 17 passengers and their baggage a distance of {{convert|1,721|km|mi|sp=us}} at {{convert|362|km|mi|sp=us}} per hour at 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), and it established a number of world records for speed-over-distance-with-payload and closed-circuit distance. One SM.75 was modified to set endurance world records, and succeeded in 1939 when it covered around {{convert|12,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nAfter Italy entered [[World War II]] on 10 June 1940, civil SM.75s continued to perform supply operations to Italian overseas territories, which dwindled as the war progressed, until the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian armistice]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] went into effect on 8 September 1943. They also continued to operate services to South America until December 1941, when Italy declared war on the [[United States]].\n\n===Italian military service===\nAfter Italy entered [[World War II]] in June 1940, the ''Regia Aeronautica'' needed aircraft with which to maintain contact with [[Italian East Africa]], which was surrounded by British-controlled territories. Available SM.75s were militarized by the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun]] mounted in a [[Caproni-Lanciani]] [[gun turret]] and the introduction of a fifth crewman to man it, and new SM.75s were manufactured to a modified design allowing them to carry up to 24 troops over long distances and with the same performance as the airliner version.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n====Special missions====\nThere were several notable missions flown mainly for propaganda purposes.\n\n=====Leaflet mission to Asmara=====\nIn January 1942, the commander-in-chief of the ''Regia Aeronautica'', [[General officer|General]] [[Rino Corso Fougier]], began plans for a long-range flight from Rome to Tokyo. He consulted with pilots with recent experience in long-range flights to South America and East Africa, and reached a consensus that the SM.75 was better suited for the mission than either the SM.82 or the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.83]] because of its superior endurance, albeit at the expense of defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks. The SM.75 aircraft selected for the flight, serial no. MM.60537, was modified to become the first long-range SM.75 GA aircraft.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe first mission of the SM.75 GA was to drop propaganda leaflets saying \"Italian colonists, Rome is not forgetting you. We shall come back!\" over British-held territory in East Africa that had constituted [[Italian East Africa]] until its conquest by the British in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of 1940-1941. A five-man crew led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Amadeo Paradisi, who piloted the aircraft, flew from Rome to [[Benghazi]] in [[Italian Libya]]. The mission began at 17:30 hours on 7 May 1942, when the SM.75 GA set out from Benghazi on the {{convert|2,700|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} first leg, flying at a planned 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), although bad weather forced Paradisi to climb to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet). After 10 hours and 20 minutes, the SM.75 GA arrived over [[Asmara]] in [[Eritrea]] and released the leaflets, but instead of returning as planned to Benghazi, Paradisi flew directly to Rome, first at 3,500 meters (11,482 feet), and then at 5,200 meters (17,060 feet) to optimize fuel consumption. The entire mission had lasted 28 hours.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nAt Rome, mechanics conducted several trials with the plane. On 11 May 1942, two days after it arrived in Rome, the SM.75GA suffered a simultaneous breakdown of all three of its engines during a {{convert|50|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} ferry flight from Rome to [[Guidonia Montecelio]]. Paradisi made an emergency landing in which the aircraft was destroyed and he lost a leg, although the rest of the crew avoided injury.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n=====Rome-to-Tokyo flight=====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 GA RT in East Asia.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Japan]]ese officials pose with the SM.75 GA RT and its crew during its July 1942 visit to [[East Asia]].]]After the loss of the first SM.75 GA, a second SM.75, serial number MM.60539, was modified to SM.75 GA standard for the Rome-to-Tokyo flight. Ready on 9 June 1942, it was designated the SM.75 GA RT (for \"Rome-Tokyo\"). Its pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Moscatelli, was placed in charge of the overall operation, which in addition to providing Italy with propaganda about Italian aviation prowess was to carry new codes for communications between Japan and her [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] partners; the Italians believed the British had broken the existing codes. The flight was made difficult to perform by the extreme distance involved and the need to fly thousands of kilometers through the airspace of the [[Soviet Union]], a country with which Italy was at war.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nTaking off from Guidonia Montecelio at 05:30 hours on 29 June 1942, the SM.75 GA RT landed later that day {{convert|2,030|km|mi|sp=us}} away at [[Zaporozhye]] in [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Ukraine]], the easternmost airfield available to the Axis powers. At 18:00 hours on 30 June 1942, carrying no documents or correspondence that might embarrass the Japanese (who were not at war with the Soviet Union) and with its crew under orders to burn the aircraft and its documents if forced down in enemy-held territory, the overloaded SM.75 GA RT made the difficult and potentially dangerous takeoff from the grassy 700-meter (2,297-foot) runway at Zaporozhye, weighing 21,500 kilograms (47,400 pounds) while having 11,000 kilograms (24,250 pounds) -- 10,340 [[liter]]s (2,721 [[gallon]]s) -- of fuel on board. Operating under strict radio silence, the aircraft continued unscathed through the night\u2014despite encountering Soviet anti-aircraft fire, bad weather conditions, and a Soviet [[Fighter (aircraft)|fighter]], probably a [[Yakovlev Yak-1]]\u2014flying over the north coast of the [[Aral Sea]], skirting [[Lake Balkhash]] and the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] and over the [[Gobi Desert]]. Maps of Soviet positions proved inaccurate, and Moscatelli had to climb to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) to avoid detection, causing the aircraft{{'}}s oxygen supply to run out earlier than planned. A [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] over [[Mongolia]] also endangered the SM.75 GA RT, but its crew sighted the [[Yellow River]] at 22:00 hours on 30 June 1942 and, on the last of its fuel, landed {{convert|6,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Zaporozhye on the 1,300-meter (4,270-foot) runway, at [[Pao Tow Chien]], over 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level in Japanese-occupied [[Inner Mongolia]], at 15:30 hours on 1 July 1942. The aircraft was repainted with Japanese markings so that it would be safe in Japanese airspace, took an interpreter aboard, and then flew the final {{convert|2,700|km|mi|abbr=on}} leg of the journey to Tokyo.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe SM.75 GA RT departed Tokyo on its return journey on 16 July 1942. Arriving at [[Baotou|Pao Tow Chien]], its Japanese markings were removed and replaced with Italian ones. It took off at 21:45 hours on 18 July 1942 from Pao Tow Chien, retraced its route, and, after 29 hours and 25 minutes in the air and having covered {{convert|6,350|km|mi|sp=us}}, it landed at [[Odessa]] in the Ukraine. Moscatelli then completed the operation by flying the aircraft on to Guidonia Montecelio. The Italians publicised this event on 2 August 1942 despite the Japanese government's reluctance for diplomatic reasons, which deteriorated relations between the two countries; the Italians made no attempt to repeat the flight.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n=====Bombing mission to Abyssinia=====\nIn 1943, two SM.75 GA aircraft undertook a bombing mission, the only one made by an SM.75, intended to destroy American bombers stored at an airbase in [[Gura, Eritrea|Gura]] in Abyssinia. To reach the objective, which was over {{convert|3,000|km|mi|sp=us}} away, the two S.75 GAs\u2014with civil registration ''I-BUBA'' and ''I-TAMO'', but renominated with serial numbers MM.60539 and MM.60543, respectively, for military use\u2014were laden heavily with 11,000 kilograms (24,250 pounds) of fuel, and modified by fitting a \"Jozza\" bomb-aiming system and a [[bomb bay]] capable of carrying 1,200 kilograms (2,650 pounds) of bombs. The most experienced crews were selected for the mission, led by officers named Villa and Peroli.\n\nThe mission started at 06:30 hours on 23 May 1943 from [[Rhodes]], the easternmost ''Regia Aeronautica'' base at the time. Each of the two aircraft, weighing 10,200 kilograms (22,490 pounds) empty, had a take-off weight of 24,000 kilograms (52,910 pounds). The SM.75 GA{{'}}s engines were optimized for endurance and economy rather than for power, which made the take off difficult with the heavy load of fuel and bombs. Initially flying at low altitude, at 10:00 hours the modified SM.75 GAs climbed to 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). Having used an excessive amount of fuel, Peroli diverted to bomb [[Port Sudan]] instead; he returned safely to Rhodes at 05:30 hours on 24 May 1943 after 23 hours in the air. Villa, meanwhile, pressed on alone and arrived over the Gura airbase\u2014which was heavily defended despite being well behind the front line\u2014at 18:45 hours and released his bombs. Although one bomb failed to drop and remained on board, presenting the threat of an explosion, Villa{{'}}s mission was successful, and his aircraft returned to Rhodes safely one hour and 15 minutes after Peroli, landing at 06:45 hours on 24 May 1943, having covered {{convert|6,600|km|mi|sp=us}} over a period of 24 hours and 15 minutes.<ref>Lembo, Daniele, ''gli ultimi voli sull'impero'', Aerei nella storia n.23, April\u2013May 2002.</ref>\n\n====Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force====\nAfter Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, some SM.75s entered service with the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]], which fought on the Allied side for the remainder of World War II.\n\nOnly a few SM.75 aircraft survived the war and actually remained in service until 1949.<ref name=\"Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207\"/>\n\n==Hungary==\nItaly exported five SM.75 aircraft to [[Hungary]] for service with the Hungarian airline [[MALERT]].

It was a low-wing, [[trimotor]] [[monoplane]] of mixed metal and wood construction with a retractable [[Conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]]. It was the last of a line of transport aeroplanes that [[Alessandro Marchetti (aircraft engineer)|Alessandro Marchetti]] began building in the early 1930s. The SM.75 was fast, robust, capable of long-range flight and could carry up to 24 passengers for 1,000 miles.<ref name=\"Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207\">Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207.</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===SM.75 and SM.75''bis''===\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti_SM.75.jpg|thumb|Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]]\nThe SM.75 was designed in response to an enquiry from the Italian [[airline]] [[Ala Littoria]], which was seeking a modern, middle-to-long-range [[airliner]] and [[cargo aircraft]] as a replacement for its [[Savoia-Marchetti S.73]] aircraft. In his design of the SM.75, Savoia-Marchetti chief designer Alessandro Marchetti (1884\u20131966) retained the general configuration of the S.73 but introduced retractable main [[landing gear]] to reduce [[aerodynamic drag]]. The SM.75{{'}}s airframe consisted of a steel-tube frame with fabric and [[plywood]] covering, and its control surfaces were plywood-covered. The SM.75 had a four-man crew, and its cabin was built to accommodate up to 25 passengers. Its short take-off run of 337 metres (1,105 feet) and shorter landing distance of 280 metres (919&nbsp;feet) meant that it could operate from short [[runway]]s on secondary [[airfield]]s.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\">Rosselli, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe SM.75 was powered by three [[Alfa Romeo 126]] RC.34 [[radial engine]]s rated at 559 [[kilowatt]]s (750 [[horsepower]]) each at 3,400 meters (11,155 feet). Eleven aircraft fitted with three Alfa Romeo 126 RC.18 14-cylinder engines rated at 641 [[kilowatt]]s (860 horsepower) at 1,800 metres (5,905 feet) were designated the '''SM.75''bis'''''.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) showed solid interest in the SM.75, resulting in the development of a militarized version. This lacked windows in the passenger cabin but was fitted with a reinforced panel to permit the installation of a dorsal [[gun turret]]. It was powered by three [[Alfa Romeo 125|Alfa Romeo 128 RC.21]] engines and had a greater cargo capacity than the SM.75, and entered military service as the '''[[Savoia-Marchetti SM.82]]'''.\n\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.87.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Savoia-Marchetti SM.87 [[float plane]].]]\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.90.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Savoia-Marchetti SM.90.]]\n\n===SM.76===\nThe Italian airline [[LATI (airline)|LATI]] received its first SM.75 in 1939. The aircraft was redesignated as the '''SM.76''' in 1940.\n\n===SM.87===\nIn 1939, a [[floatplane]] version of the SM.75 appeared. Known as the '''SM.87''', it was powered by three 746&nbsp;kW (1,000&nbsp;hp) [[Fiat A.80]] engines. It could reach a speed of 365&nbsp;km/h (227&nbsp;mph) and had a ceiling of 6,250&nbsp;m (20,510&nbsp;ft), a range of {{convert|2,200|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and a crew of four, and could accommodate 24 passengers. Four were built.\n\n===SM.90===\nThe '''SM.90''' was a version of the SM.75 fitted with more powerful 1,044&nbsp;kW (1,400&nbsp;hp) [[Alfa Romeo 135|Alfa Romeo 135 R.C.32]] engines. It had a longer [[fuselage]] than the SM.75. Only one was built.\n\n===SM.75GA===\nThe SM.75 GA (for ''Grande Autonomia'', meaning \"Long Range\") was a modification of the SM.75 powered by three 641&nbsp;kW (860&nbsp;hp) [[Alfa Romeo 125|Alfa Romeo 128]] engines and fitted as well as a powerful radio and auxiliary fuel tanks to boost the aircraft{{'}}s range to 7,000 kilometers (4,350 statute miles) with a 1,100-[[kilogram]] (2,430-[[Pound (weight)|pound]]) load. With a four- or five-man crew and a 200-kilogram (441-pound) load, the SM.75 GA could achieve a range of 8,005 kilometers (4,971 statute miles) at 298 kilometers per hour (185 miles per hour) flying at altitudes between 3,500 and 5,000 meters (11,483 and 16,404 feet).<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Italian commercial service===\nThe SM.75 first flew in November 1937 from [[Novara]], in [[Piedmont]]. It entered commercial service with Ala Littoria in 1938 and with LATI in 1939, and was employed on services both within [[Europe]] and to [[South America]], as well as on the [[Rome]]-[[Addis Ababa]] route established after the Italian invasion\u2014and later conquest\u2014of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. The SM.75 proved easily capable of carrying a crew of four and 17 passengers and their baggage a distance of {{convert|1,721|km|mi|sp=us}} at {{convert|362|km|mi|sp=us}} per hour at 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), and it established a number of world records for speed-over-distance-with-payload and closed-circuit distance. One SM.75 was modified to set endurance world records, and succeeded in 1939 when it covered around {{convert|12,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nAfter Italy entered [[World War II]] on 10 June 1940, civil SM.75s continued to perform supply operations to Italy{{'}} overseas territories, which dwindled as the war progressed, until the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian armistice]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] went into effect on 8 September 1943. They also continued to operate services to South America until December 1941, when Italy declared war on the [[United States]].\n\n===Italian military service===\nAfter Italy entered [[World War II]] in June 1940, the ''Regia Aeronautica'' needed aircraft with which to maintain contact with [[Italian East Africa]], which was surrounded by British-controlled territories. Available SM.75s were militarized by the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun]] mounted in a [[Caproni-Lanciani]] [[gun turret]] and the introduction of a fifth crewman to man it, and new SM.75s were manufactured to a modified design allowing them to carry up to 24 troops over long distances and with the same performance as the airliner version.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n====Special missions====\nThere were several notable missions flown mainly for propaganda purposes.\n\n=====Leaflet mission to Asmara=====\nIn January 1942, the commander-in-chief of the ''Regia Aeronautica'', [[General officer|General]] [[Rino Corso Fougier]], began plans for a long-range flight from Rome to Tokyo. He consulted with pilots with recent experience in long-range flights to South America and East Africa, and reached a consensus that the SM.75 was better suited for the mission than either the SM.82 or the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.83]] because of its superior endurance, albeit at the expense of defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks. The SM.75 aircraft selected for the flight, serial no. MM.60537, was modified to become the first long-range SM.75 GA aircraft.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe first mission of the SM.75 GA was to drop propaganda leaflets saying \"Italian colonists, Rome is not forgetting you. We shall come back!\" over British-held territory in East Africa that had constituted [[Italian East Africa]] until its conquest by the British in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of 1940-1941. A five-man crew led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Amadeo Paradisi, who piloted the aircraft, flew from Rome to [[Benghazi]] in [[Italian Libya]]. The mission began at 17:30 hours on 7 May 1942, when the SM.75 GA set out from Benghazi on the {{convert|2,700|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} first leg, flying at a planned 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), although bad weather forced Paradisi to climb to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet). After 10 hours and 20 minutes, the SM.75 GA arrived over [[Asmara]] in [[Eritrea]] and released the leaflets, but instead of returning as planned to Benghazi, Paradisi flew directly to Rome, first at 3,500 meters (11,482 feet), and then at 5,200 meters (17,060 feet) to optimize fuel consumption. The entire mission had lasted 28 hours.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nAt Rome, mechanics conducted several trials with the plane. On 11 May 1942, two days after it arrived in Rome, the SM.75GA suffered a simultaneous breakdown of all three of its engines during a {{convert|50|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} ferry flight from Rome to [[Guidonia Montecelio]]. Paradisi made an emergency landing in which the aircraft was destroyed and he lost a leg, although the rest of the crew avoided injury.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n=====Rome-to-Tokyo flight=====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 GA RT in East Asia.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Japan]]ese officials pose with the SM.75 GA RT and its crew during its July 1942 visit to [[East Asia]].]]After the loss of the first SM.75 GA, a second SM.75, serial number MM.60539, was modified to SM.75 GA standard for the Rome-to-Tokyo flight. Ready on 9 June 1942, it was designated the SM.75 GA RT (for \"Rome-Tokyo\"). Its pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Moscatelli, was placed in charge of the overall operation, which in addition to providing Italy with propaganda about Italian aviation prowess was to carry new codes for communications between Japan and her [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] partners; the Italians believed the British had broken the existing codes. The flight was made difficult to perform by the extreme distance involved and the need to fly thousands of kilometers through the airspace of the [[Soviet Union]], a country with which Italy was at war.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nTaking off from Guidonia Montecelio at 05:30 hours on 29 June 1942, the SM.75 GA RT landed later that day {{convert|2,030|km|mi|sp=us}} away at [[Zaporozhye]] in [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Ukraine]], the easternmost airfield available to the Axis powers. At 18:00 hours on 30 June 1942, carrying no documents or correspondence that might embarrass the Japanese (who were not at war with the Soviet Union) and with its crew under orders to burn the aircraft and its documents if forced down in enemy-held territory, the overloaded SM.75 GA RT made the difficult and potentially dangerous takeoff from the grassy 700-meter (2,297-foot) runway at Zaporozhye, weighing 21,500 kilograms (47,400 pounds) while having 11,000 kilograms (24,250 pounds) -- 10,340 [[liter]]s (2,721 [[gallon]]s) -- of fuel on board. Operating under strict radio silence, the aircraft continued unscathed through the night\u2014despite encountering Soviet anti-aircraft fire, bad weather conditions, and a Soviet [[Fighter (aircraft)|fighter]], probably a [[Yakovlev Yak-1]]\u2014flying over the north coast of the [[Aral Sea]], skirting [[Lake Balkhash]] and the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] and over the [[Gobi Desert]]. Maps of Soviet positions proved inaccurate, and Moscatelli had to climb to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) to avoid detection, causing the aircraft{{'}}s oxygen supply to run out earlier than planned. A [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] over [[Mongolia]] also endangered the SM.75 GA RT, but its crew sighted the [[Yellow River]] at 22:00 hours on 30 June 1942 and, on the last of its fuel, landed {{convert|6,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Zaporozhye on the 1,300-meter (4,270-foot) runway, at [[Pao Tow Chien]], over 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level in Japanese-occupied [[Inner Mongolia]], at 15:30 hours on 1 July 1942. The aircraft was repainted with Japanese markings so that it would be safe in Japanese airspace, took an interpreter aboard, and then flew the final {{convert|2,700|km|mi|abbr=on}} leg of the journey to Tokyo.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\nThe SM.75 GA RT departed Tokyo on its return journey on 16 July 1942. Arriving at [[Baotou|Pao Tow Chien]], its Japanese markings were removed and replaced with Italian ones. It took off at 21:45 hours on 18 July 1942 from Pao Tow Chien, retraced its route, and, after 29 hours and 25 minutes in the air and having covered {{convert|6,350|km|mi|sp=us}}, it landed at [[Odessa]] in the Ukraine. Moscatelli then completed the operation by flying the aircraft on to Guidonia Montecelio. The Italians publicised this event on 2 August 1942 despite the Japanese government's reluctance for diplomatic reasons, which deteriorated relations between the two countries; the Italians made no attempt to repeat the flight.<ref name=\"Rosselli, p. 20\"/>\n\n=====Bombing mission to Abyssinia=====\nIn 1943, two SM.75 GA aircraft undertook a bombing mission, the only one made by an SM.75, intended to destroy American bombers stored at an airbase in [[Gura, Eritrea|Gura]] in Abyssinia. To reach the objective, which was over {{convert|3,000|km|mi|sp=us}} away, the two S.75 GAs\u2014with civil registration ''I-BUBA'' and ''I-TAMO'', but renominated with serial numbers MM.60539 and MM.60543, respectively, for military use\u2014were laden heavily with 11,000 kilograms (24,250 pounds) of fuel, and modified by fitting a \"Jozza\" bomb-aiming system and a [[bomb bay]] capable of carrying 1,200 kilograms (2,650 pounds) of bombs. The most experienced crews were selected for the mission, led by officers named Villa and Peroli.\n\nThe mission started at 06:30 hours on 23 May 1943 from [[Rhodes]], the easternmost ''Regia Aeronautica'' base at the time. Each of the two aircraft, weighing 10,200 kilograms (22,490 pounds) empty, had a takeoff-weight of 24,000 kilograms (52,910 pounds). The SM.75 GA{{'}}s engines were optimized for endurance and economy rather than for power, which made the takeoff difficult with the heavy load of fuel and bombs. Initially flying at low altitude, at 10:00 hours the modified SM.75 GAs climbed to 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). Having used an excessive amount of fuel, Peroli diverted to bomb [[Port Sudan]] instead; he returned safely to Rhodes at 05:30 hours on 24 May 1943 after 23 hours in the air. Villa, meanwhile, pressed on alone and arrived over the Gura airbase\u2014which was heavily defended despite being well behind the front line\u2014at 18:45 hours and released his bombs. Although one bomb failed to drop and remained on board, presenting the threat of an explosion, Villa{{'}}s mission was successful, and his aircraft returned to Rhodes safely one hour and 15 minutes after Peroli, landing at 06:45 hours on 24 May 1943, having covered {{convert|6,600|km|mi|sp=us}} over a period of 24 hours and 15 minutes.<ref>Lembo, Daniele, ''gli ultimi voli sull'impero'', Aerei nella storia n.23, April\u2013May 2002.</ref>\n\n====Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force====\nAfter Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, some SM.75s entered service with the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]], which fought on the Allied side for the remainder of World War II.\n\nOnly a few SM.75 aircraft survived the war and actually remained in service until 1949.<ref name=\"Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 207\"/>\n\n==Hungary==\nItaly exported five SM.75 aircraft to [[Hungary]] for service with the Hungarian airline [[MALERT]].

Unfortunately, the leading aircraft, code E-101, crashed immediately afterwards. Twenty three Hungarians lost their lives, including 19 paratroopers.

RAF squadrons are somewhat analogous to the regiments of the British Army in that they have histories and traditions going back to their formation, regardless of where they are based, which aircraft they are operating, etc. They can be awarded [[flag|standards]] and [[RAF battle honours|battle honours]] for meritorious service. Whilst every squadron is different, most flying squadrons are commanded by a wing commander and, for a fast-jet squadron, have an establishment of around 12 aircraft.<ref name=RAFstation/>\n\n===Training Schools===\n{{Main|List of Royal Air Force schools}}\n\nThe RAF Schools consist of the squadrons and support apparatus that train new aircrew to join front-line squadrons. The schools separate individual streams, but group together units with similar responsibility or that operate the same aircraft type.  Some schools operate with only one Squadron, and have an overall training throughput which is relatively small; some, like [[No. 3 Flying Training School RAF|3 FTS]], have responsibility for all Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the RAF, and all RAF aircrew will pass through its squadrons when they start their flying careers. [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAF|2 FTS]] and [[No. 6 Flying Training School RAF|6 FTS]] do not have a front-line training responsibility \u2013 their job is to group the [[University Air Squadron]]s and the [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]]s together. 2 FTS's commanding officer holds the only full-time flying appointment for a Group Captain in the RAF, although he is a reservist.\n\n*[[Central

Because of their small size, there are several flying units formed as flights rather than squadrons. For example, [[No. 1435 Flight RAF|No. 1435 Flight]] is based at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] in the [[Falkland Islands]], maintaining air defence cover with four Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of 1435 Squadron|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/1435squadron.cfm|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133723/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/1435squadron.cfm|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n{{See also|List of Royal Air Force personnel|List of comparative military ranks}}\n[[File:RAF Regiment (8658943968) (2).jpg|thumb|Members of the [[RAF Regiment]] on parade, 2013]]\nAt its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 1,100,000 personnel were serving in the RAF.

RAF squadrons are somewhat analogous to the regiments of the British Army in that they have histories and traditions going back to their formation, regardless of where they are based, which aircraft they are operating, etc. They can be awarded [[flag|standards]] and [[RAF battle honours|battle honours]] for meritorious service. Whilst every squadron is different, most flying squadrons are commanded by a wing commander and, for a fast-jet squadron, have an establishment of around 12 aircraft.<ref name=RAFstation/>\n\n===Training Schools===\n{{Main|List of Royal Air Force schools}}\n\nThe RAF Schools consist of the squadrons and support apparatus that train new aircrew to join front-line squadrons. The schools separate individual streams, but group together units with similar responsibility or that operate the same aircraft type.  Some schools operate with only one Squadron, and have an overall training throughput which is relatively small; some, like [[No. 3 Flying Training School RAF|3 FTS]], have responsibility for all Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the RAF, and all RAF aircrew will pass through its squadrons when they start their flying careers. [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAF|2 FTS]] and [[No. 6 Flying Training School RAF|6 FTS]] do not have a front-line training responsibility \u2013 their job is to group the [[University Air Squadron]]s and the [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]]s together. 2 FTS's commanding officer holds the only full-time flying appointment for a Group Captain in the RAF, although he is a reservist.\n\n*[[Central

Because of their small size, there are several flying units formed as flights rather than squadrons. For example, [[No. 1435 Flight RAF|No. 1435 Flight]] is based at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] in the [[Falkland Islands]], maintaining air defence cover with four Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of 1435 Squadron|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/1435squadron.cfm|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133723/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/1435squadron.cfm|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n{{See also|List of Royal Air Force personnel|List of comparative military ranks}}\n[[File:RAF Regiment (8658943968) (2).jpg|thumb|Members of the [[RAF Regiment]] on parade, 2013]]\nAt its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 1,100,000 personnel were serving in the RAF.

In October 1914, therefore, the French system of three concentric rings was adopted, with the colours reversed to a red disc surrounded by a white ring and an outer blue ring.<ref name=\"robertson89\">Robertson 1967, p 89</ref> The relative sizes of the rings have changed over the years and during World War II an outer yellow ring was added to the fuselage roundel.
