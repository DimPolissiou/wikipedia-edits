It is {{convert|43|mi|km}} south of [[Salt Lake City]] along the [[Wasatch Front]]. Provo is the largest city and [[county seat]] of [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]]. It is home to [[Brigham Young University]], and [[Sundance Resort]] is located just northeast of the city.\n\nWhile Father [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]], a Spanish Franciscan missionary-explorer, is considered the first European visitor to the area that would become Provo, the first permanent settlement was established in 1849 as [[Fort Utah]]. The name was changed to \"Provo\" in 1850, in honor of [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], an early French-Canadian trapper. Provo's climate lies in the transition zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and [[humid continental climate]], with temperatures averaging between about {{convert|94|F|C|1|disp=or}} in the summer and {{convert|40|F|C|1|disp=or}} in the winter. Average annual precipitation (rain and snow) is just under {{convert|20|in|cm}}. The population of Provo has grown from 2030 in 1860 to an estimated 116,702 in 2018. The 2010 census showed slightly more females than males, with over 55% of the population living as couples, and almost 35% of households having children under the age of 18. The population is over 90% Christian, with almost 89% being [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]]. \n\nThe economy in Provo is powered by many different businesses and organizations, including over 100 restaurants, two shopping malls, multiple universities and colleges, a number of small companies, and several large international businesses. [[Utah Valley Hospital]] is a Level II Trauma Center, and has several campuses of medical professionals surrounding it. [[America's Freedom Festival at Provo]], held every May through July, is one of the largest [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in the United States. Several cultural points of interest in the city include the Covey Center for the Arts, the LDS [[Missionary Training Center]], and the [[Provo City Library|Provo City Library at Academy Square]]. Provo contains two [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]: [[Provo Utah Temple]] and [[Provo City Center Temple]], the latter being restored from the ruins of the [[Provo Tabernacle]]. The Utah Valley Convention Center is also located in downtown Provo. There are several museums located on the campus of Brigham Young University.\n\nNatural features include [[Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)|Bridal Veil Falls]], [[Provo River]], [[Utah Lake]] and [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. [[Timpanogos Cave National Monument]] is located several miles north of Provo. A number of national historic landmarks are located within Provo, including the [[Reed O. Smoot House]]. Provo is served by [[Utah Transit Authority]], operator of the [[FrontRunner]] commuter rail and a bus service connected to the rest of the [[Wasatch Front]]. [[Amtrak]] stops at [[Provo station (Amtrak)|Provo station]], providing daily access to its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' service. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]], [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] and [[U.S. Route 189|U.S. 189]] provide major road service to Provo.

At first, they were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave a small militia orders \"to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.\" This ended in what is known as the [[Battle Creek massacre]], in modern-day [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]].\n \nThe Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands. In 1849, 33 [[Mormon]] families from Salt Lake City established [[Fort Utah]].

One of these peaks, known as [[Y Mountain]], towers over the city. There is a large [[hillside letter]] ''Y'' made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate [[Brigham Young University]] (original plans included construction of all three letters: BYU). Wild deer (and less frequently, [[cougar]]s, and [[moose]]) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets). The geography allows for hiking, [[skiing]], [[fishing]] and other outdoor activities.\n\n===Climate===\nProvo's climate lies in the transition zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''/''Dfa''), though summers are barely wet enough to avoid a [[Mediterranean climate]] classification (''Csa''/''Dsa''). Overall, annual rainfall at the location of Brigham Young University is around {{convert|19.75|in|mm|-1|disp=or}}; however, the western part of the metropolitan area near Orem is substantially drier, receiving only around {{convert|13.5|in|mm|-1|disp=or}} of precipitation and consequently has a [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''BSk'').<ref name = NOAA /> The wettest calendar year in Provo has been 1983 with {{convert|37.54|in|mm|1}} and the driest 2002 with {{convert|10.65|in|mm|1}}.<ref name = NOAA />\n \nWinters are cold with substantial snowfall averaging {{convert|57.2|in|m|2|disp=or}} and a record monthly total of {{convert|66.0|in|m|2}} in January 1918, during which the record snow cover of {{convert|34|in|m|2|disp=or}} was record on the 17th.

Very cold weather may occur when cold air from over the [[Continental Divide]] invades the region: although only four mornings fall to or below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} during an average winter and this temperature was not reached at all between 1999 and 2006, during the very cold January 1917 (average temperature {{convert|14.9|F|C|1|disp=or}}), seventeen mornings fell this cold.<ref name = NOAA /> By contrast, in several recent winters like 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 1999\u20132000, 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306, averages have been above freezing during every month.\n \nTemperatures warm rapidly during the spring, with the first afternoon over {{convert|70|F|C|1|disp=or}} on March 21, the last freeze expected on April 29, and the first temperature equal to or hotter than {{convert|90|F|C|1|disp=or}} on May 30. Rainfall is not infrequent during the spring: over {{convert|5.10|in|mm|-1|disp=or}} was recorded in the Mays of 1995 and 2011, and a total of {{convert|12.29|in|mm|1}} fell during the four-month span of March to June, 2005 \u2013 in contrast as little as {{convert|2.04|in|mm|1}} fell in the same months of 2012.<ref name = NOAA />\n \nBeing too far north to gain any influence from [[North American Monsoon|the monsoon]] except in rare cases like the {{convert|4.38|in|mm|1}} rainfall of August 1983, the summers of Provo are hot and dry, though relatively short \u2013 no maxima above {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}} have been recorded outside the range of June 7 to August 27.

[[Utah Valley Hospital]] is a Level II Trauma Center, and has several campuses of medical professionals surrounding it. [[America's Freedom Festival at Provo]], held every May through July, is one of the largest [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in the United States. Several cultural points of interest in the city include the Covey Center for the Arts, the LDS [[Missionary Training Center]], and the [[Provo City Library|Provo City Library at Academy Square]]. Provo contains two [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]: [[Provo Utah Temple]] and [[Provo City Center Temple]], the latter being restored from the ruins of the [[Provo Tabernacle]]. The Utah Valley Convention Center is also located in downtown Provo. There are several museums located on the campus of Brigham Young University.\n\nNatural features include [[Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)|Bridal Veil Falls]], [[Provo River]], [[Utah Lake]] and [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. [[Timpanogos Cave National Monument]] is located several miles north of Provo. A number of national historic landmarks are located within Provo, including the [[Reed O. Smoot House]]. Provo is served by [[Utah Transit Authority]], operator of the [[FrontRunner]] commuter rail and a bus service connected to the rest of the [[Wasatch Front]]. [[Amtrak]] stops at [[Provo station (Amtrak)|Provo station]], providing daily access to its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' service. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]], [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] and [[U.S. Route 189|U.S. 189]] provide major road service to Provo.

At first, they were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave a small militia orders \"to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.\" This ended in what is known as the [[Battle Creek massacre]], in modern-day [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]].\n \nThe Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands.

There is a large [[hillside letter]] ''Y'' made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate [[Brigham Young University]] (original plans included construction of all three letters: BYU). Wild deer (and less frequently, [[cougar]]s, and [[moose]]) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets).

Auxins play a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life cycles and are essential for plant body development. The Dutch biologist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] first described auxins and their role in plant growth in the 1920s.<ref>\n[https://archive.is/20010724034517/http://bob.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/fwent.html Frits Warmolt Went]\n</ref>\n[[Kenneth V. Thimann]] (1904-1997) became the first to isolate one of these [[phytohormones]] and to determine its chemical structure as [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937.\n\n==Overview==\nAuxins were the first of the major [[plant hormone]]s to be discovered. They derive their name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u03b1\u03c5\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''auxein'' \u2013 \"to grow/increase\"). \n The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates \"patterns\" of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.\n\nThe (dynamic and environment responsive) [[Pattern formation#Biology|pattern]] of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs<ref name=\"shaping\"/><ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/> (such as [[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s). It is achieved through very complex and well-coordinated [[active transport|active]] transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body \u2014 by the so-called [[polar auxin transport]].<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a [[nervous system]]. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to [[cytokinin]] in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.\n\nOn the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a [[carboxylic acid]] group.<ref name=\"Taiz\"/> The most important member of the auxin family is [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA),<ref name=Simon>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1= L. |first2= J. |last2= Bousquet |first3= R.C. |last3= L\u00e9vesque |first4= M. |last4=Lalonde |date=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue= 6424 |pages= 67\u201369 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S |doi=10.1038/363067a0 }}</ref> which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] to degradation of its molecules, always according to the requirements of the situation.\n\n* Five naturally occurring (endogenous) auxins in plants include indole-3-acetic acid, [[4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid|4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid]], [[phenylacetic acid]], [[indole-3-butyric acid]], and [[indole-3-propionic acid]].<ref name=\"simon\">{{cite journal| title=Why plants need more than one type of auxin |author1=Simon, S |author2=Petr\u00e1\u0161ek, P | journal=Plant Science | year=2011 | volume=180 | issue=3 | pages=454\u2013460 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.12.007 | pmid=21421392|url=https://zenodo.org/record/894396 }}<!--https://zenodo.org/record/894396--></ref><ref name=\"Auxin 2011 review\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig-M\u00fcller J | title = Auxin conjugates: their role for plant development and in the evolution of land plants | journal = J.

Alongside endogenous auxins, scientists and manufacturers have developed many synthetic compounds with auxinic activity.\n* Synthetic auxin analogs include [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|1-naphthaleneacetic acid]], [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D),<ref name=\"simon\"/> and many others.\n\nSome synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T), are used also as [[herbicide]]s. Broad-leaf plants ([[dicots]]), such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than narrow-leaf plants ([[monocots]]) such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops, so these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. <!---''See also chapter [[Auxin#Auxinic herbicides|Auxinic herbicides]]''.--->\n\n==Discovery of auxin==\n\n===Charles Darwin===\nIn 1881, [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] performed experiments on [[coleoptiles]], the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=23152332 |year=2013 |last1=Hohm|first1=T |last2=Preuten |first2=T|last3=Fankhauser |first3=C |title=Phototropism: Translating light into directional growth |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201359 |doi=10.3732/ajb.1200299 |journal=American Journal of Botany|url=https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_BFBF5EAD16F0.P001/REF.pdf }}</ref> By covering various parts of the coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the [[hypocotyl]]. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.<ref name=\"Whippo\">{{cite journal |pmid=16670442 |year=2006 |last1=Whippo |first1=CW |last2=Hangarter |first2=RP |title=Phototropism: Bending towards enlightenment |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1110\u20139 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmc=1456868 |journal=The Plant Cell}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Boysen-Jensen===\nIn 1913, Danish scientist Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the signal was not transfixed but mobile. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a cube of gelatine which prevented cellular contact but allowed chemicals to pass through. The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.<ref name=\"bare_url\">Mendipweb [http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Nature of auxin]</ref>\n\n===Frits Went===\n{{main|Frits Warmolt Went}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dutch botanist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards the light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centered on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.<ref name=\"Whippo\" />\n\nWhen the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards the light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in coleoptiles bending towards the light.<ref name=\"bare_url\" />\n\n==Hormonal activity==\nAuxins help \ndevelopment at all levels in plants, from the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.\n\n=== Molecular mechanisms ===\nWhen a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in [[gene expression]], with many genes up- or down-regulated. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are still an area of active research, but there is now a general consensus on at least two auxin signalling pathways.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Leyser|first=Ottoline|date=2018-01-01|title=Auxin Signaling|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=176|issue=1|pages=465\u2013479|doi=10.1104/pp.17.00765|issn=0032-0889|pmid=28818861|pmc=5761761}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Enders|first=Tara A.|last2=Strader|first2=Lucia C.|date=February 2015|title=Auxin Activity: Past, present, and Future|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=102|issue=2|pages=180\u2013196|doi=10.3732/ajb.1400285|issn=0002-9122|pmc=4854432|pmid=25667071}}</ref>\n\n====Perception ====\nThe most well-characterized auxin receptors are the TIR1/ AFB family of [[F-box protein]]s. F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the [[Ubiquitin|ubiquitin degradation pathway]]. When TIR1/ AFB proteins bind to auxin, the auxin acts as a 'molecular glue' that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below).\n\nAnother auxin-binding protein, ABP1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the [[apoplast]]), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway, and much less is known about ABP1 signaling.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====\n[[File: Auxin signal cascade.jpg|thumb|''' The auxin signal cascade:''' In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAA bind to and suppress the transcriptional activity of ARFs. When auxin is present it forms a 'molecular glue' between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, which leads to the degradation of these repressors. ARFs are then free to bind to DNA and to cause changes in transcription.]]\nAuxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of [[transcription factor]]s that act in auxin signaling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAA suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAA to ARFs brings Aux/IAA into contact with the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of auxin-regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAA repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the [[DNA]] structure.\n\nThe binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA frees ARF proteins, which are then able to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe large number of Aux/IAA and ARF binding pairs possible, and their different distributions between cell types and across developmental age are thought to account for the astonishingly diverse responses that auxin produces.\n\nIn June 2018 it was demonstrated that plant tissues can respond to auxin in a TIR1-dependent manner extremely quickly (probably too quickly to be explained by changes in gene expression). This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fendrych|first=Maty\u00e1\u0161|last2=Akhmanova|first2=Maria|last3=Merrin|first3=Jack|last4=Glanc|first4=Matou\u0161|last5=Hagihara|first5=Shinya|last6=Takahashi|first6=Koji|last7=Uchida|first7=Naoyuki|last8=Torii|first8=Keiko U.|last9=Friml|first9=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=2018-06-25|title=Rapid and reversible root growth inhibition by TIR1 auxin signalling|journal=Nature Plants|volume=4|issue=7|pages=453\u2013459|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41477-018-0190-1|pmid=29942048|pmc=6104345|issn=2055-0278}}</ref>\n\n=== On a cellular level ===\nOn the cellular level, auxin is essential for [[cell growth]], affecting both [[cell division]] and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to [[cell differentiation]] and specification of the cell fate.\n\nDepending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.\n\n===Organ patterns===\nGrowth and division of plant cells together result in the growth of [[Biological tissue|tissue]], and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant [[organ (anatomy)#Plant organs|organ]]s.\n\nGrowth of cells contributes to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources ([[phototropism]]), roots growing in response to gravity ([[gravitropism]]), and other [[tropism]]s originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.\n\n====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====\n{{further|polar auxin transport}}\n\nTo cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mashiguchi|first=Kiyoshi|date=2011|title=The main auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis|journal=PNAS|doi=10.1073/pnas.1108434108|pmid=22025724|volume=108|issue=45|pmc=3215075|pages=18512\u20137|bibcode=2011PNAS..10818512M}}</ref> but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from [[meristem|peaks of shoots]] to peaks of roots (from up to down).\n\nFor long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in [[phloem]] vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some [[morphogen]]etic properties.\n\nThis process, [[polar auxin transport]], is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction.

Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where the directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons, and leaves and mediates long-distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant.<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Throughout the plant's life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth,<ref name=\"shaping\"/> and actually \"recognize\" where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.\n\nAn important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is [[apical dominance]], which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as [[strigolactone]]s or [[cytokinins]]) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in [[pruning]] by horticulturists.\n\nFinally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by the outgrowth of lateral buds \u2014 which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving at the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.\n<!---------- Is this section necessary?\n==Locations==\n; Biosynthesis\n\nAuxins are not synthesized everywhere, but each cell retains the potential ability to do so, and only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated.

The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of the plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.<ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/>\n\nAuxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as [[elastin]]s, to loosen [[cell wall]]s. The effect is stronger if [[gibberellins]] are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if [[cytokinins]] are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to [[callus]], rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. [[Xylem]] tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration is equal to the cytokinins.\n\nAuxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.\n\n===Wound response===\nAuxin induces the formation and organization of [[phloem]] and [[xylem]].

As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.\n\nIn horticulture, auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|NAA]] and [[Indole-3-butyric acid|IBA]], are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation.  Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.\n\n===Apical dominance===\nAuxin induces shoot [[apical dominance]]; the [[axillary bud]]s are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates [[ethylene]] synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.<ref>Ji\u0159\u00ed Friml Lab (2012).

When seeds are removed from strawberries, fruit growth is stopped; exogenous auxin stimulates the growth in fruits with seeds removed. For fruit with unfertilized seeds, exogenous auxin results in [[parthenocarpy]] (\"virgin-fruit\" growth).\n\nFruits form abnormal morphologies when auxin transport is disturbed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nemhauser JL, Feldman LJ, Zambryski PC |title=Auxin and ETTIN in ''Arabidopsis'' gynoecium morphogenesis |journal=Development |volume=127 |issue=18 |pages=3877\u201388 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10952886 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10952886}}</ref> In ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' fruits, auxin controls the release of seeds from the fruit (pod).

In low concentrations, it can delay the [[senescence]] of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either auxin synthesis or transport.

Many of them had been found to have economical potential for man-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy. Synthetic auxins include the following compounds:\n\n<center><gallery caption=\"Gallery of synthetic auxins\">\nImage:2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid structure.svg|[[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D); active herbicide and main auxin in laboratory use\nImage:Kwas naftylooctowy.svg|[[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|\u03b1-Naphthalene acetic acid]] (\u03b1-NAA); often part of commercial rooting powders\nImage:Dicamba.png|[[2-Methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid]] (dicamba); active herbicide\nImage:Picloram.svg|[[4-Amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid]] (tordon or picloram); active herbicide\nFile:2,4,5-T.svg|[[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) \n</gallery></center>\nAuxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to [[dicot]]s and less so to [[monocot]]s. Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides, including [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]], have been developed and used for [[weed]] control.\n\nHowever, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially [[1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in [[orchard]]s.\n\nUsed in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of [[ethylene]]. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause [[leaf|leaves]] to fall ([[abscission]]), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as [[herbicide]]s. [[Dicots]], such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than [[monocots]], such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still so.<ref>[http://www.24d.org/ The Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]</ref> [[2,4-D]] was first commercialized by the [[Sherwin-Williams]] company and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.\n\n\t3,5,6-TPA while known as an herbicide, has also been shown to increase the size of fruit in plants. At increased concentrations, the hormone can be lethal. Dosing down to the correct concentration has been shown to alter photosynthetic pathways. This hindrance to the plant causes a response that increases carbohydrate production leading to bigger fruiting bodies.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00344-011-9230-z | volume=31 | issue=2 | title=Synthetic Auxin 3,5,6-TPA Provokes Citrus clementina (Hort. ex Tan) Fruitlet Abscission by Reducing Photosynthate Availability | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | pages=186\u2013194 | last1 = Mesejo | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Rosito | first2 = Salvatore | last3 = Reig | first3 = Carmina | last4 = Mart\u00ednez-Fuentes | first4 = Amparo | last5 = Agust\u00ed | first5 = Manuel}}</ref>\n\n; Herbicide manufacture\nThe [[defoliant]] [[Agent Orange]], used extensively by British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.

The [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] is an unavoidable contaminant produced in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. As a result of the integral dioxin contamination, 2,4,5-T has been implicated in [[leukemia]], [[miscarriage]]s, [[birth defect]]s, [[liver]] damage, and other [[disease]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Auxin binding protein]]\n* [[Fusicoccin]]\n* [[Herbicide]]; ''specifically, see the chapter: <sup>[[Herbicide#History|#History]]</sup>''\n** [[Phenoxy herbicide]]\n* [[Pruning fruit trees]]\n* [[Tropism]]\n*[[Witch's broom]]\n*[[Toshio Murashige]]\n*[[Folke K.

Auxins play a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life cycles and are essential for plant body development. The Dutch biologist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] first described auxins and their role in plant growth in the 1920s.<ref>\n[https://archive.is/20010724034517/http://bob.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/fwent.html Frits Warmolt Went]\n</ref>\n[[Kenneth V. Thimann]] (1904-1997) became the first to isolate one of these [[phytohormones]] and to determine its chemical structure as [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937.\n\n==Overview==\nAuxins were the first of the major [[plant hormone]]s to be discovered. They derive their name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u03b1\u03c5\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''auxein'' \u2013 \"to grow/increase\"). \n The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates \"patterns\" of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.\n\nThe (dynamic and environment responsive) [[Pattern formation#Biology|pattern]] of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs<ref name=\"shaping\"/><ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/> (such as [[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s). It is achieved through very complex and well-coordinated [[active transport|active]] transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body \u2014 by the so-called [[polar auxin transport]].<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a [[nervous system]]. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to [[cytokinin]] in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.\n\nOn the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a [[carboxylic acid]] group.<ref name=\"Taiz\"/> The most important member of the auxin family is [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA),<ref name=Simon>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1= L. |first2= J. |last2= Bousquet |first3= R.C. |last3= L\u00e9vesque |first4= M. |last4=Lalonde |date=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue= 6424 |pages= 67\u201369 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S |doi=10.1038/363067a0 }}</ref> which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] to degradation of its molecules, always according to the requirements of the situation.\n\n* Five naturally occurring (endogenous) auxins in plants include indole-3-acetic acid, [[4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid|4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid]], [[phenylacetic acid]], [[indole-3-butyric acid]], and [[indole-3-propionic acid]].<ref name=\"simon\">{{cite journal| title=Why plants need more than one type of auxin |author1=Simon, S |author2=Petr\u00e1\u0161ek, P | journal=Plant Science | year=2011 | volume=180 | issue=3 | pages=454\u2013460 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.12.007 | pmid=21421392|url=https://zenodo.org/record/894396 }}<!--https://zenodo.org/record/894396--></ref><ref name=\"Auxin 2011 review\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig-M\u00fcller J | title = Auxin conjugates: their role for plant development and in the evolution of land plants | journal = J.

Broad-leaf plants ([[dicots]]), such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than narrow-leaf plants ([[monocots]]) such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops, so these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. <!---''See also chapter [[Auxin#Auxinic herbicides|Auxinic herbicides]]''.--->\n\n==Discovery of auxin==\n\n===Charles Darwin===\nIn 1881, [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] performed experiments on [[coleoptiles]], the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=23152332 |year=2013 |last1=Hohm|first1=T |last2=Preuten |first2=T|last3=Fankhauser |first3=C |title=Phototropism: Translating light into directional growth |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201359 |doi=10.3732/ajb.1200299 |journal=American Journal of Botany|url=https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_BFBF5EAD16F0.P001/REF.pdf }}</ref> By covering various parts of the coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the [[hypocotyl]]. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.<ref name=\"Whippo\">{{cite journal |pmid=16670442 |year=2006 |last1=Whippo |first1=CW |last2=Hangarter |first2=RP |title=Phototropism: Bending towards enlightenment |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1110\u20139 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmc=1456868 |journal=The Plant Cell}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Boysen-Jensen===\nIn 1913, Danish scientist Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the signal was not transfixed but mobile. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a cube of gelatine which prevented cellular contact but allowed chemicals to pass through. The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.<ref name=\"bare_url\">Mendipweb [http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Nature of auxin]</ref>\n\n===Frits Went===\n{{main|Frits Warmolt Went}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dutch botanist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards the light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centered on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.<ref name=\"Whippo\" />\n\nWhen the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards the light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in coleoptiles bending towards the light.<ref name=\"bare_url\" />\n\n==Hormonal activity==\nAuxins help \ndevelopment at all levels in plants, from the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.\n\n=== Molecular mechanisms ===\nWhen a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in [[gene expression]], with many genes up- or down-regulated.

F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the [[Ubiquitin|ubiquitin degradation pathway]]. When TIR1/ AFB proteins bind to auxin, the auxin acts as a 'molecular glue' that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below).\n\nAnother auxin-binding protein, ABP1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the [[apoplast]]), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway, and much less is known about ABP1 signaling.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====\n[[File: Auxin signal cascade.jpg|thumb|''' The auxin signal cascade:''' In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAA bind to and suppress the transcriptional activity of ARFs. When auxin is present it forms a 'molecular glue' between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, which leads to the degradation of these repressors. ARFs are then free to bind to DNA and to cause changes in transcription.]]\nAuxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of [[transcription factor]]s that act in auxin signaling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAA suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAA to ARFs brings Aux/IAA into contact with the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of auxin-regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAA repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the [[DNA]] structure.\n\nThe binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation.

This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fendrych|first=Maty\u00e1\u0161|last2=Akhmanova|first2=Maria|last3=Merrin|first3=Jack|last4=Glanc|first4=Matou\u0161|last5=Hagihara|first5=Shinya|last6=Takahashi|first6=Koji|last7=Uchida|first7=Naoyuki|last8=Torii|first8=Keiko U.|last9=Friml|first9=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=2018-06-25|title=Rapid and reversible root growth inhibition by TIR1 auxin signalling|journal=Nature Plants|volume=4|issue=7|pages=453\u2013459|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41477-018-0190-1|pmid=29942048|pmc=6104345|issn=2055-0278}}</ref>\n\n=== On a cellular level ===\nOn the cellular level, auxin is essential for [[cell growth]], affecting both [[cell division]] and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to [[cell differentiation]] and specification of the cell fate.\n\nDepending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.\n\n===Organ patterns===\nGrowth and division of plant cells together result in the growth of [[Biological tissue|tissue]], and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant [[organ (anatomy)#Plant organs|organ]]s.\n\nGrowth of cells contributes to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources ([[phototropism]]), roots growing in response to gravity ([[gravitropism]]), and other [[tropism]]s originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.\n\n====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====\n{{further|polar auxin transport}}\n\nTo cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them.

For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from [[meristem|peaks of shoots]] to peaks of roots (from up to down).\n\nFor long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in [[phloem]] vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some [[morphogen]]etic properties.\n\nThis process, [[polar auxin transport]], is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction.

Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where the directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons, and leaves and mediates long-distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant.<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Throughout the plant's life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth,<ref name=\"shaping\"/> and actually \"recognize\" where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.\n\nAn important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is [[apical dominance]], which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as [[strigolactone]]s or [[cytokinins]]) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in [[pruning]] by horticulturists.\n\nFinally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by the outgrowth of lateral buds \u2014 which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving at the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.\n<!---------- Is this section necessary?\n==Locations==\n; Biosynthesis\n\nAuxins are not synthesized everywhere, but each cell retains the potential ability to do so, and only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated.

The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of the plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.<ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/>\n\nAuxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as [[elastin]]s, to loosen [[cell wall]]s. The effect is stronger if [[gibberellins]] are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if [[cytokinins]] are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to [[callus]], rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. [[Xylem]] tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration is equal to the cytokinins.\n\nAuxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.\n\n===Wound response===\nAuxin induces the formation and organization of [[phloem]] and [[xylem]].

As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.\n\nIn horticulture, auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|NAA]] and [[Indole-3-butyric acid|IBA]], are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation.  Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.\n\n===Apical dominance===\nAuxin induces shoot [[apical dominance]]; the [[axillary bud]]s are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates [[ethylene]] synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.<ref>Ji\u0159\u00ed Friml Lab (2012).

Many of them had been found to have economical potential for man-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy. Synthetic auxins include the following compounds:\n\n<center><gallery caption=\"Gallery of synthetic auxins\">\nImage:2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid structure.svg|[[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D); active herbicide and main auxin in laboratory use\nImage:Kwas naftylooctowy.svg|[[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|\u03b1-Naphthalene acetic acid]] (\u03b1-NAA); often part of commercial rooting powders\nImage:Dicamba.png|[[2-Methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid]] (dicamba); active herbicide\nImage:Picloram.svg|[[4-Amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid]] (tordon or picloram); active herbicide\nFile:2,4,5-T.svg|[[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) \n</gallery></center>\nAuxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to [[dicot]]s and less so to [[monocot]]s. Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides, including [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]], have been developed and used for [[weed]] control.\n\nHowever, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially [[1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in [[orchard]]s.\n\nUsed in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of [[ethylene]]. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause [[leaf|leaves]] to fall ([[abscission]]), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as [[herbicide]]s. [[Dicots]], such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than [[monocots]], such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still so.<ref>[http://www.24d.org/ The Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]</ref> [[2,4-D]] was first commercialized by the [[Sherwin-Williams]] company and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.\n\n\t3,5,6-TPA while known as an herbicide, has also been shown to increase the size of fruit in plants. At increased concentrations, the hormone can be lethal. Dosing down to the correct concentration has been shown to alter photosynthetic pathways. This hindrance to the plant causes a response that increases carbohydrate production leading to bigger fruiting bodies.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00344-011-9230-z | volume=31 | issue=2 | title=Synthetic Auxin 3,5,6-TPA Provokes Citrus clementina (Hort. ex Tan) Fruitlet Abscission by Reducing Photosynthate Availability | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | pages=186\u2013194 | last1 = Mesejo | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Rosito | first2 = Salvatore | last3 = Reig | first3 = Carmina | last4 = Mart\u00ednez-Fuentes | first4 = Amparo | last5 = Agust\u00ed | first5 = Manuel}}</ref>\n\n; Herbicide manufacture\nThe [[defoliant]] [[Agent Orange]], used extensively by British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.

Regions can be  distinct [[habitat]]s like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of a historic era as in ''fossil flora''. Lastly, floras may be subdivided by special environments:\n\n*''Native flora''. The native and indigenous flora of an area.\n*''Agricultural and horticultural flora (garden flora)''. The plants that are deliberately grown by humans.\n*''Weed flora''. Traditionally this classification was applied to plants regarded as undesirable, and studied in efforts to control or eradicate them.  Today the designation is less often used as a classification of plant life, since it includes three different types of plants: [[weed]]y species, [[invasive species]] (that may or may not be weedy), and native and introduced non-weedy species that are agriculturally undesirable.  Many native plants previously considered weeds have been shown to be beneficial or even necessary to various [[ecosystem]]s.\n\n==Documentation of floras==\n[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=2|The botanical continents of the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used for classifying floras geographically]]\n{{main|Flora (publication)}}\n<!-- Images Begin -->\n[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|right|Floristic regions in Europe according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer L\u00f6sch]]\n<!-- Images End -->\n\nThe flora of a particular area or time period can be documented in a publication also known as a \"[[Flora (publication)|flora]]\" (often capitalized as \"Flora\" to distinguish the two meanings when they might be confused).
