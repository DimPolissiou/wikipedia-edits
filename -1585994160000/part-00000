Gramm's testimony and [[expert witness|expert psychiatric opinion]] are crucial in the conviction of Forster for the attempted killing of Janie Cates (Tammy Hui) and the murder of her sister Joanie ([[Vicky Huang]]), who was drugged, hanged upside down and killed after the killer invaded the sisters' apartment. Upon receiving a guilty verdict from the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \"Tick-tock, Doc.\"\n\nNine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar [[torture murder]]s occur. Gramm, now teaching at the [[University of Washington]], is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as [[FBI]] Special Agent Frank Parks ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]). The latest victim, Dale Morris (Kristina Copeland), is revealed to be a former psychology student of Gramm's; they attended the same party the night before. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using a [[voice changer]], informing that he has 88 minutes to live. He reports the call to his secretary, Shelly ([[Amy Brenneman]]), asking for a risk assessment profile of suspects.\n\nGramm receives another phone threat while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt ([[Benjamin McKenzie]]). The Dean of Students, Carol Johnson ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), interrupts the class to report a bomb threat. Evacuating, Gramm finds threats written both on the classroom's overhead projector and on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage. Gramm is then met by his teaching assistant, Kim Cummings ([[Alicia Witt]]), who offers to help find the perpetrator. In the stairwell, Gramm encounters one of his students, Lauren Douglas ([[Leelee Sobieski]]), attacked by an unknown assailant and reports the assault to campus security.\n\nGramm and Kim go to his condo, where a package has been delivered. The package contains an audio tape of his kid sister, Kate (Victoria Tennant II), crying for help before being murdered. Gramm concludes that someone accessed his secure files to obtain the tape. Kim's ex-husband, Guy LaForge ([[Stephen Moyer]]), appears with a gun at the apartment door, but is shot and killed from behind by an assailant masked by a motorcycle helmet. A fire alarm is triggered by the sudden onset of smoke and the shooter flees through the crowd outside. Shortly after, Gramm's car explodes, having been rigged with a bomb.\n\nRenting a cab, Gramm explains to Kim that his sister was killed decades earlier, when he left her alone in his apartment; the crime took exactly 88 minutes. Next, Gramm and Kim visit Sara Pollard ([[Leah Cairns]]), a woman Gramm slept with the night before, but find her murdered in her apartment with evidence incriminating Gramm. Carol calls Gramm and makes comments suggesting that she is the killer, demanding that Gramm meet her at his office. Shelly arrives at Sara's apartment and advises Gramm that she suspects Lauren was the one who stole the audio tape of Kate's death. Kim disappears from the apartment and later calls Gramm with a threat similar to Carol's, also demanding he meet her at the office.\n\nThrough prison visitation records, Gramm deduces that Forster's appeals attorney \"Lydia Doherty\" is a pseudonym for Lauren, surmising that she set up the frame on orders from Forster. Kim calls again, instructing Gramm to come to another nearby location on campus, where he finds Carol hanging over a seventh floor balcony; Kim is tied up and gagged nearby, held at gun point by Lauren. Lauren forces Gramm to \"confess\" on tape that he gave false testimony at Forster's trial. Special Agent Parks arrives and shoots Lauren, causing both Carol and Lauren to partially fall from the balcony. Gramm saves Carol from completing the fall, but Lauren comes loose and plummets to her death. When Forster calls asking to speak with Lauren, Gramm informs him of Lauren's death. He quips \"Tick-tock, tick-tock, you got 12 hours to live\" before throwing the phone into the void. Gramm flashes back to interactions with Kate and Janie Cates, then pockets the device that recorded his \"confession\". He shares knowing glances with Parks and Kim before walking away.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Dr. Jack Gramm\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Kim Cummings\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Lauren Douglas/Lydia Doherty\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Shelly Barnes\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Special Agent Frank Parks\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Carol Johnson\n* [[Benjamin McKenzie]] as Mike Stempt\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Jon Forster\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Sara Pollard\n* [[Stephen Moyer]] as Guy LaForge\n* Christopher Redman as Jeremy Guber\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Johnny d'Franco\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as J.

Carol calls Gramm and makes comments suggesting that she is the killer, demanding that Gramm meet her at his office. Shelly arrives at Sara's apartment and advises Gramm that she suspects Lauren was the one who stole the audio tape of Kate's death. Kim disappears from the apartment and later calls Gramm with a threat similar to Carol's, also demanding he meet her at the office.\n\nThrough prison visitation records, Gramm deduces that Forster's appeals attorney \"Lydia Doherty\" is a pseudonym for Lauren, surmising that she set up the frame on orders from Forster. Kim calls again, instructing Gramm to come to another nearby location on campus, where he finds Carol hanging over a seventh floor balcony; Kim is tied up and gagged nearby, held at gun point by Lauren. Lauren forces Gramm to \"confess\" on tape that he gave false testimony at Forster's trial. Special Agent Parks arrives and shoots Lauren, causing both Carol and Lauren to partially fall from the balcony. Gramm saves Carol from completing the fall, but Lauren comes loose and plummets to her death. When Forster calls asking to speak with Lauren, Gramm informs him of Lauren's death. He quips \"Tick-tock, tick-tock, you got 12 hours to live\" before throwing the phone into the void. Gramm flashes back to interactions with Kate and Janie Cates, then pockets the device that recorded his \"confession\". He shares knowing glances with Parks and Kim before walking away.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Dr. Jack Gramm\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Kim Cummings\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Lauren Douglas/Lydia Doherty\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Shelly Barnes\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Special Agent Frank Parks\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Carol Johnson\n* [[Benjamin McKenzie]] as Mike Stempt\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Jon Forster\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Sara Pollard\n* [[Stephen Moyer]] as Guy LaForge\n* Christopher Redman as Jeremy Guber\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Johnny d'Franco\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as J.
