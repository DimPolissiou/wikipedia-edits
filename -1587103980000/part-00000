PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility. Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first 6 of which are published each year before the season starts. Names not retired from this list will be used again in the [[1987 Pacific typhoon season|1987 season]]. This is the same list used for the [[1979 Pacific typhoon season|1979 season]]. PAGASA uses its own naming scheme that starts in the [[Filipino alphabet]], with names of Filipino female names ending with \"ng\" (A, B, K, D, etc.). Names that were not assigned/going to use are marked in {{tcname unused}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season effects==\nThis table will list all the storms that developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean west of the [[International Date Line]] and north of the equator during 1983. It will include their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, deaths, missing persons (in parentheses), and damage totals. Classification and intensity values will be based on estimations conducted by the JMA. All damage figures will be in 1983&nbsp;USD. Damages and deaths from a storm will include when the storm was a precursor wave or an extratropical low.\n\n{{Pacific areas affected (Top)}}\n|-\n| TD || {{Sort|830607|June 7&nbsp;\u2013 9}} ||

A total of 26 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 23 became tropical storms.  Of the 26 tropical cyclones, one formed in June, three formed in July, six formed in August, three formed in September, seven formed in October, five formed in November, and two formed in December.  Twelve storms reached typhoon intensity, of which four reached super typhoon strength.

Names that were not assigned/going to use are marked in {{tcname unused}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season effects==\nThis table will list all the storms that developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean west of the [[International Date Line]] and north of the equator during 1983. It will include their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, deaths, missing persons (in parentheses), and damage totals. Classification and intensity values will be based on estimations conducted by the JMA. All damage figures will be in 1983&nbsp;USD. Damages and deaths from a storm will include when the storm was a precursor wave or an extratropical low.\n\n{{Pacific areas affected (Top)}}\n|-\n| TD || {{Sort|830607|June 7&nbsp;\u2013 9}} ||

Free movement of goods was established in principle through the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its then-[[Inner Six|six member states]].\n\nHowever the EEC struggled to enforce a single market due to the absence of strong decision-making structures. It was difficult to remove [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|intangible barriers]] with mutual recognition of standards and common regulations due to protectionist attitudes.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the economy of the EEC began to lag behind the rest of the developed world, [[Margaret Thatcher]] sent [[Arthur Cockfield, Baron Cockfield]], to the [[Delors Commission]] to take the initiative to attempt to relaunch the common market. Cockfield wrote and published a White Paper in 1985 identifying 300 measures to be addressed in order to complete a single market.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockfield|first=Arthur|title=''European Union: Creating The European Single Market''|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cGnsAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Wiley Chancery Law|accessdate=28 March 2017|isbn=9780471952077}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=John|title=''Lord Cockfield''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-cockfield-432900.html|work=The Independent| accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://archives.eui.eu/en/files/transcript/15166.pdf|title=''EU Archives''|publisher=European Union|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> The White Paper was well received and led to the adoption of the [[Single European Act]], a treaty which reformed the decision-making mechanisms of the EEC and set a deadline of 31 December 1992 for the completion of a single market. In the end, it was launched on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11769554|title=EU glossary: Jargon S-Z|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe new approach, pioneered at the Delors Commission, combined positive and negative integration, relying upon minimum rather than exhaustive harmonisation. Negative integration consists of prohibitions imposed on member states banning discriminatory behaviour and other restrictive practices. Positive integration consists of approximating laws and standards. Especially important (and controversial) in this respect is the adoption of harmonising legislation under Article 114 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU).\n\nThe Commission also relied upon the [[ECJ|European Court of Justice]]'s [[Cassis de Dijon (court case)|''Cassis de Dijon'']]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61978J0120:EN:NOT|title=? \u2013 EUR-Lex|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref> jurisprudence, under which member states were obliged to recognise goods which had been legally produced in another member state, unless the member state could justify the restriction by reference to a mandatory requirement. Harmonisation would only be used to overcome barriers created by trade restrictions which survived the ''Cassis'' mandatory requirements test, and to ensure essential standards where there was a risk of a [[race to the bottom]]. Thus harmonisation was largely used to ensure basic health and safety standards were met.\n\nBy 1992 about 90% of the issues had been resolved<ref name=\"EP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/3_1_0_en.htm|title=Introduction \u2013 EU fact sheets \u2013 European Parliament|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref> and in the same year the [[Maastricht Treaty]] set about to create an [[Economic and Monetary Union]] as the next stage of integration. Work on freedom for services did take longer, and was the last freedom to be implemented, mainly through the [[Posted Workers Directive|Posting of Workers Directive]] (adopted in 1996)<ref name=\"Directive 96/71/EC\">Directive 96/71/EC</ref> and the [[Directive on services in the internal market]] (adopted in 2006).<ref name=\"Directive 2006/123/EC\">Directive 2006/123/EC</ref>\n\nIn 1997 the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] abolished physical barriers across the internal market by incorporating the [[Schengen Area]] within the competences of the EU. The [[Schengen Agreement]] implements the abolition of border controls between most member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial co-operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/schengen/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm|title=Justice policies at a glance \u2013 European Commission|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nEven as the [[Lisbon Treaty]] came into force in 2009 however, some areas pertaining to parts of the four freedoms (especially in the field of services) had not yet been completely opened. Those, along with further work on the economic and monetary union, would see the EU move further to a ''European Home Market''.<ref name=\"EP\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Four freedoms}}The \"Four Freedoms\"==\nThe \"Four Freedoms\" of the single market are:\n* Free movement of goods\n* Free movement of capital\n* Freedom to establish and provide services\n* Free movement of persons\n\n===Goods===\n====Customs duties and taxation====\n{{Main|European Union Customs Union}}\nThe [[customs union]] of the European Union removes customs barriers between member states and operates a common customs policy towards external countries, with the aim \"to ensure normal conditions of competition and to remove all restrictions of a fiscal nature capable of hindering the free movement of goods within the Common Market\".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61967J0027:EN:NOT Case 27/67 ''Fink-Frucht'']</ref>\n\nAspects of the EU Customs area extend to a number of non-EU-member states, such as [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and [[Turkey]], under separately negotiated arrangements.\n\n=====Customs duties=====\nArticle 30 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\") prohibits border levies between member states on both [[European Union Customs Union]] produce and non-EUCU (third-country) produce.

This \"wide test\",<ref>See D Chalmers et al, ''European Union Law'' (1st edn 2006) 662, \"This is a ridiculously wide test.\"</ref> to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"[[Buy Irish]]\" company that had government appointees.<ref>''[[Commission v Ireland (1982)|Commission v Ireland]]'' (1982) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61981CJ0249 Case 249/81]</ref> It also means states can be responsible for private actors.

So, in ''[[Schmidberger v Austria]]''<ref>(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0112&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-112/00], [2003] ECR I-5659</ref> the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that [[Austria]] did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, [[Brenner Autobahn]], en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] reasoned that [[freedom of association]] is one of the \"fundamental pillars of a democratic society\", against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced,<ref>(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0112&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-112/00], [79]-[81]</ref> and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied [[Proportionality (law)|proportionately]]. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be [[suitable]] to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be [[reasonable]] in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.<ref>c.f.

See [[ECHR]] articles 10 and 11.</ref>]] \nOften rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as [[consumer protection]], improving [[labour standards]],<ref>''[[Oebel]]'' (1981) Case 155/80</ref> protecting the environment,<ref>''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05</ref> press diversity,<ref>''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95</ref> fairness in commerce,<ref>''[[Dansk Supermarked A/S]]'' (1981) Case 58/80</ref> and more: the categories are not closed.<ref>See C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) 172\u2013173, listing the present state.</ref> In the most famous case ''[[Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein]]'',<ref>(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78]</ref> the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to [[TFEU]] article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but [[Cassis de Dijon]], which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under [[TFEU]] article 36,<ref>At the time, [[TEEC]] article 30</ref> because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought.<ref>(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78], [13]-[14]</ref> This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In ''[[Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA]]''<ref>(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81]</ref> the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a Belgian law requiring all [[margarine]] to be in [[cube]] shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!|would believe it was butter]] if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\".<ref>(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81], [17]</ref> In a 2003 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2003)|Commission v Italy]]''<ref>(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0014&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-14/00], [88]-[89]</ref> Italian law required that cocoa products that included other [[vegetable fat]]s could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from [[cocoa butter]] alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \"neutral and objective statement\" was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2009)|Commission v Italy]]'', the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.<ref>(2009) C-110/05, [2009] ECR I-519</ref> Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the [[Market access|access of that product to the market]]\".<ref>(2009) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62005CJ0110&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-110/05], [2009] ECR I-519, [56]. See also ''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05, on prohibiting jet skis, but justified if proportionate towards the aim of safeguarding health and the environment.</ref> It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.\n\nIn contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder [[market access]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into [[TFEU]] article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In ''[[Keck and Mithouard]]''<ref>(1993) C-267/91</ref> two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French [[competition law]], which prevented them selling [[Picon beer]] under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent [[cut throat competition]], not to hinder trade.<ref>See also ''[[Torfaen BC v B&Q plc]]'' (1989) C-145/88, holding the UK Sunday trading laws in the former [[Shops Act 1950]] were probably outside the scope of article 34 (but not clearly reasoned). The \"rules reflect certain political and economic choices\" that \"accord with national or regional socio-cultural characteristics.\"</ref> The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content<ref>cf ''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95</ref>) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini]]''<ref>(1997) C-34/95, [1997] ECR I-3843</ref> the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reviewed [[Sweden|Swedish]] bans on [[advertising to children]] under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB]]''<ref>(2001) C-405/98, [2001] ECR I-1795</ref> the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.<ref>[[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF 2005/29/EC]</ref> Increasingly, states have to give [[mutual recognition]] to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \"[[race to the bottom]]\", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.\n\n===Capital===\n{{Clist capital movement}}\n{{See also|Payment Services Directive|Capital control|Single Euro Payments Area|Economic and Monetary Union of the EU}}\nFree movement of [[capital (economics)|capital]] was traditionally seen as the fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original [[Treaty of Rome]] required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed to the extent necessary for the common market. From the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], now in [[TFEU]] article 63, \"all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited\". This means [[capital controls]] of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying [[company shares]] or financial assets, or government approval requirements for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. By contrast, taxation of capital, including [[corporate tax]], [[capital gains tax]] and [[financial transaction tax]], are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the [[Capital Movement Directive 1988]], Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered.<ref>[[Capital Movement Directive 1988]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31988L0361&from=EN 88/361/EEC]) Annex I, including (i) investment in companies, (ii) real estate, (iii) securities, (iv) collective investment funds, (v) money market securities, (vi) bonds, (vii) service credit, (viii) loans, (ix) sureties and guarantees (x) insurance rights, (xi) inheritance and personal loans, (xii) physical financial assets (xiii) other capital movements.</ref> In ''[[Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a \"definite influence\" through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor.<ref>(2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0251&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-251/98], [22]</ref> That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, [[TFEU]] article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent [[tax evasion]].<ref>e.g. ''[[Commission v Belgium]]'' (2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0478&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-478/98], holding that a law forbidding Belgian residents getting securities of loans on the [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]] was unjustified discrimination. It was disproportionate in preserving, as Belgium argued, fiscal coherence or supervision.</ref> Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of [[Advocate General Maduro]],<ref>See ''[[Commission v Netherlands]]'' (2006) C\u2011282/04, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62004CC0282 AG Maduro's Opinion] on golden shares in KPN NV and TPG NV.</ref> a series of cases held that government owned [[golden shares]] were unlawful. In ''[[Commission v Germany (2007)|Commission v Germany]]'' the Commission claimed the German [[Volkswagen Act 1960]] violated article 63, in that \u00a72(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and \u00a74(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the [[Lower Saxony]] government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders.<ref>(2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62005CJ0112&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-112/05]</ref> Similarly, in ''[[Commission v Portugal]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that [[Portugal]] infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in [[Portugal Telecom]] that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a \"deterrent effect on portfolio investments\" and reduing \"the attractiveness of an investment\".<ref>(2010) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62008CJ0171&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-171/08]</ref> This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with [[TFEU]] article 345.<ref>[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_Seven:_General_and_Final_Provisions#Article_345 art 345]</ref>\n\nCapital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one country to another (except that Greece currently has [[Capital controls in Greece|capital controls]] restricting outflows, and Cyprus imposed capital controls between 2013 and April 2015).

Following a Report of the [[Delors Commission]] in 1988,<ref>See Delors Report, ''Report on Economic and Monetary Union in the EC'' (1988)</ref> the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] made [[Economic and Monetary Union of the EU|economic and monetary union]] an objective, first by completing the internal market, second by creating a [[European System of Central Banks]] to co-ordinate common monetary policy, and third by locking exchange rates and introducing a single currency, the [[euro]]. Today, 19 member states have adopted the [[euro]], while 9 member states have either determined to opt-out or their accession has been delayed, particularly since the [[Eurozone crisis]].

UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 [[Danish krone]] (around \u20ac27,000) to protect [[creditors]] if the company failed and went [[Insolvency (law)|insolvent]]. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection.<ref>(1999) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&uri=CELEX:61997CJ0212 C-212/97], [1999] ECR I-1459.

Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment.<ref>(2002) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&uri=CELEX:62000CJ0208 C-208/00], [92]-[93]</ref> However, in ''[[Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt]]'' the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose.

In ''[[Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds]]''<ref>(2001) C-157/99, [2001] ECR I-5473</ref> Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in (Germany). The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service.<ref>(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-157/99], [48]-[55]</ref> National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary.<ref>(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-157/99], [94] and [104]-[106]</ref> The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's [[National Health Service]].<ref>See ''[[Watts v Bedford Primary Care Trust]]'' (2006) C-372/04 and ''[[Commission v Spain]]'' (2010) C-211/08</ref> Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. ''[[Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht]]'' held that the Netherlands' regulation of [[cannabis]] consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]],<ref>(2010) C\u2011137/09, [2010] I-13019</ref> fell outside article 56 altogether. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.\n\nIf an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or over-riding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In ''[[Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn]]''<ref>(1995) C-384/93, [1995] ECR I-1141</ref> a business that sold [[commodities]] [[futures contract|futures]] (with [[Merrill Lynch]] and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting [[cold calling]] customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In ''[[Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn]]''<ref>(2004) C-36/02, [2004] ECR I-9609</ref> a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the [[Bonn]] council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of [[human dignity]], which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In ''[[Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa]]'' the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a [[Gibraltar]] firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent.<ref>(2009) C\u201142/07, [2007] ECR I-7633</ref> The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This means the basic \"worker\" rights in [[TFEU]] article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in [[TFEU]] articles 18 to 21. According to the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]], a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\".<ref>''[[Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]'' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61985CJ0066 Case 66/85], [1986] ECR 2121</ref> A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in ''[[Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie]]'', a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the [[Bhagwan]] community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions.<ref>(1988) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61985CJ0066 Case 196/87], [1988] ECR 6159</ref> The [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and [[social security]] rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" ([[TFEU]] article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim [[social security]].<ref>''[[Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig]]'' (2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0333&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C\u2011333/13]</ref> In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties appear to have utilised concerns about immigrants taking jobs and benefits.\n\n[[File:Bozen Waltherplatz.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA|Angonese]]'' the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] gave \"horizontal [[direct effect]]\" to free movement, so a bank could not refuse employment to a worker who lacked a [[Bolzano]] language certificate.<ref>''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]'' (2000) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61998CJ0281 C-281/98], [2000] ECR I-4139</ref>]]\nThe [[Free Movement of Workers Regulation]] articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state.<ref>[[Free Movement of Workers Regulation]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32011R0492 492/2011] arts 1\u20134</ref> In a famous case, the ''[[Belgian Football Association v Bosman]]'', a Belgian footballer named [[Jean-Marc Bosman]] claimed that he should be able to transfer from [[R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge]] to [[USL Dunkerque]] when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees.<ref>(1995) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415 C-415/93]</ref> The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In ''[[Groener v Minister for Education]]''<ref>(1989) Case 379/87, [1989] ECR 3967</ref> the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to teach in a [[Dublin]] design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in ''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]''<ref>(2000) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61998CJ0281 C-281/98], [2000] ECR I-4139, [36]-[44]</ref> a bank in [[Bolzano]], Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to [[TFEU]] article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In ''[[Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker]]''<ref>(1995) C-279/93</ref> the Court of Justice held that it contravened [[TFEU]] art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in ''[[Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg]]'' the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified.<ref>(2004) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62001CJ0387&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-387/01], [54]-[55]</ref> Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In ''[[Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands.<ref>(2007) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62005CJ0287 C-287/05], [55]</ref> Conversely, in ''[[Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits,<ref>(2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=62748&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=66471 C-213/05]</ref> even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.<ref>''[[Hartmann v Freistaat Bayern]]'' (2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=62747&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=70077 C-212/05]. Discussed in C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the European Union'' (2013) ch 9, 293\u2013294</ref> The general justifications for limiting free movement in [[TFEU]] article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\",<ref>See ''[[Van Duyn v Home Office]]'' Case 41/74, [1974] ECR 1337</ref> and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".\n\nFor workers not citizens of the union but employed in one member state with work permit, there is not the same freedom of movement within the Union. They need to apply for a new work permit if wanting to work in a different state. A facilitation mechanism for this process is the [[Van Der Elst visa]] which gives easier rules should a non-EU worker already in one EU state need to be sent to another, for the same employer, because of a service contract that the employer made with a customer in that other state.\n\n====Free movement of citizens====\n{{Clist citizen rights}}\n{{see also|Citizenship of the European Union}}\nBeyond the right of free movement to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply by being a [[Human rights|human being]].<ref>See NN Shuibhne, \u2018The Resilience of EU Market Citizenship\u2019 (2010) 47 CMLR 1597 and HP Ipsen, ''Europ\u00e4isches Gemeinschaftsrecht'' (1972) on the concept of a \u2018market citizen\u2019 (''Marktb\u00fcrger'').</ref> But although the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] stated that \u2018Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States\u2019,<ref>''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d\u2019Aide Sociale d\u2019Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]'' (2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193</ref> political debate remains on who should have access to public services and welfare systems funded by taxation.<ref>See T Marshall, ''Citizenship and Social Class'' (1950) 28-9, positing that \u2018citizenship\u2019 passed from civil rights, political rights, to social rights, and [[JHH Weiler]], \u2018The European Union belongs to its citizens: Three immodest proposals\u2019 (1997) [http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415458511/parts/part-2/students/articles/weiler-article.rtf 22 European Law Review 150]</ref> In 2008, just 8 million people from 500&nbsp;million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority of them workers.<ref>''5th Report on Citizenship of the Union'' COM(2008) 85.

[[Schengen Area]] countries (of which Ireland is not included) have abolished the need to show travel documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in [[TFEU]] article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of \"sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system\". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions.

In a simple case, in ''[[Sala v Freistaat Bayern]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a Spanish woman who had lived in (Germany) for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to [[child support]], without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one.<ref>(1998) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61996CJ0085 C-85/96], [1998] ECR I-2691</ref> In ''[[Trojani v Centre public d\u2019aide sociale de Bruxelles]]'', a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the \"minimex\" allowance from the state for a minimum living wage.<ref>(2004) C-456/02, [2004] ECR I-07573</ref> In ''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d\u2019Aide Sociale d\u2019Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]''<ref>(2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193</ref> a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the \"minimex\" income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in ''[[R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that it was lawful to require a French [[University College London|UCL]] economics student to have lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional \"settled status\".<ref>(2005) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62003CJ0209&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-209/03], [2005] ECR I-2119</ref> Similarly, in ''[[Commission v Austria]]'', Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid \"structural, staffing and financial problems\" if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem.<ref>(2005) C-147/03</ref> However, in ''[[Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig]]'', the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny [[child support]] to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of \"sufficient resources\", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7.<ref>(2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0333&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C\u2011333/13]</ref>\n\n====Schengen Area====\n{{Main|Schengen Area}}\n\nWithin the [[Schengen Area]] 22 of 28 EU member states (excluding [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], Ireland, [[Romania]] and the United Kingdom) and the four [[EFTA]] members ([[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], and [[Switzerland]]) have abolished physical barriers across the single market by eliminating border controls.

Free movement of goods was established in principle through the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its then-[[Inner Six|six member states]].\n\nHowever the EEC struggled to enforce a single market due to the absence of strong decision-making structures. It was difficult to remove [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|intangible barriers]] with mutual recognition of standards and common regulations due to protectionist attitudes.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the economy of the EEC began to lag behind the rest of the developed world, [[Margaret Thatcher]] sent [[Arthur Cockfield, Baron Cockfield]], to the [[Delors Commission]] to take the initiative to attempt to relaunch the common market. Cockfield wrote and published a White Paper in 1985 identifying 300 measures to be addressed in order to complete a single market.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockfield|first=Arthur|title=''European Union: Creating The European Single Market''|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cGnsAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Wiley Chancery Law|accessdate=28 March 2017|isbn=9780471952077}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=John|title=''Lord Cockfield''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-cockfield-432900.html|work=The Independent| accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://archives.eui.eu/en/files/transcript/15166.pdf|title=''EU Archives''|publisher=European Union|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> The White Paper was well received and led to the adoption of the [[Single European Act]], a treaty which reformed the decision-making mechanisms of the EEC and set a deadline of 31 December 1992 for the completion of a single market. In the end, it was launched on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11769554|title=EU glossary: Jargon S-Z|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe new approach, pioneered at the Delors Commission, combined positive and negative integration, relying upon minimum rather than exhaustive harmonisation. Negative integration consists of prohibitions imposed on member states banning discriminatory behaviour and other restrictive practices. Positive integration consists of approximating laws and standards. Especially important (and controversial) in this respect is the adoption of harmonising legislation under Article 114 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU).\n\nThe Commission also relied upon the [[ECJ|European Court of Justice]]'s [[Cassis de Dijon (court case)|''Cassis de Dijon'']]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61978J0120:EN:NOT|title=? \u2013 EUR-Lex|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref> jurisprudence, under which member states were obliged to recognise goods which had been legally produced in another member state, unless the member state could justify the restriction by reference to a mandatory requirement. Harmonisation would only be used to overcome barriers created by trade restrictions which survived the ''Cassis'' mandatory requirements test, and to ensure essential standards where there was a risk of a [[race to the bottom]].

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as [[consumer protection]], improving [[labour standards]],<ref>''[[Oebel]]'' (1981) Case 155/80</ref> protecting the environment,<ref>''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05</ref> press diversity,<ref>''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95</ref> fairness in commerce,<ref>''[[Dansk Supermarked A/S]]'' (1981) Case 58/80</ref> and more: the categories are not closed.<ref>See C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) 172\u2013173, listing the present state.</ref> In the most famous case ''[[Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein]]'',<ref>(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78]</ref> the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to [[TFEU]] article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but [[Cassis de Dijon]], which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under [[TFEU]] article 36,<ref>At the time, [[TEEC]] article 30</ref> because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought.<ref>(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78], [13]-[14]</ref> This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In ''[[Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA]]''<ref>(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81]</ref> the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a Belgian law requiring all [[margarine]] to be in [[cube]] shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!|would believe it was butter]] if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\".<ref>(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81], [17]</ref> In a 2003 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2003)|Commission v Italy]]''<ref>(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0014&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-14/00], [88]-[89]</ref> Italian law required that cocoa products that included other [[vegetable fat]]s could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from [[cocoa butter]] alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \"neutral and objective statement\" was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2009)|Commission v Italy]]'', the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.<ref>(2009) C-110/05, [2009] ECR I-519</ref> Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the [[Market access|access of that product to the market]]\".<ref>(2009) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62005CJ0110&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-110/05], [2009] ECR I-519, [56]. See also ''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05, on prohibiting jet skis, but justified if proportionate towards the aim of safeguarding health and the environment.</ref> It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.\n\nIn contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder [[market access]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into [[TFEU]] article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In ''[[Keck and Mithouard]]''<ref>(1993) C-267/91</ref> two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French [[competition law]], which prevented them selling [[Picon beer]] under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent [[cut throat competition]], not to hinder trade.<ref>See also ''[[Torfaen BC v B&Q plc]]'' (1989) C-145/88, holding the UK Sunday trading laws in the former [[Shops Act 1950]] were probably outside the scope of article 34 (but not clearly reasoned). The \"rules reflect certain political and economic choices\" that \"accord with national or regional socio-cultural characteristics.\"</ref> The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content<ref>cf ''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95</ref>) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini]]''<ref>(1997) C-34/95, [1997] ECR I-3843</ref> the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reviewed [[Sweden|Swedish]] bans on [[advertising to children]] under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB]]''<ref>(2001) C-405/98, [2001] ECR I-1795</ref> the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.<ref>[[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF 2005/29/EC]</ref> Increasingly, states have to give [[mutual recognition]] to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \"[[race to the bottom]]\", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.\n\n===Capital===\n{{Clist capital movement}}\n{{See also|Payment Services Directive|Capital control|Single Euro Payments Area|Economic and Monetary Union of the EU}}\nFree movement of [[capital (economics)|capital]] was traditionally seen as the fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original [[Treaty of Rome]] required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed to the extent necessary for the common market. From the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], now in [[TFEU]] article 63, \"all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited\". This means [[capital controls]] of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying [[company shares]] or financial assets, or government approval requirements for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. By contrast, taxation of capital, including [[corporate tax]], [[capital gains tax]] and [[financial transaction tax]], are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the [[Capital Movement Directive 1988]], Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered.<ref>[[Capital Movement Directive 1988]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31988L0361&from=EN 88/361/EEC]) Annex I, including (i) investment in companies, (ii) real estate, (iii) securities, (iv) collective investment funds, (v) money market securities, (vi) bonds, (vii) service credit, (viii) loans, (ix) sureties and guarantees (x) insurance rights, (xi) inheritance and personal loans, (xii) physical financial assets (xiii) other capital movements.</ref> In ''[[Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a \"definite influence\" through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor.<ref>(2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0251&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-251/98], [22]</ref> That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, [[TFEU]] article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent [[tax evasion]].<ref>e.g. ''[[Commission v Belgium]]'' (2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0478&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-478/98], holding that a law forbidding Belgian residents getting securities of loans on the [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]] was unjustified discrimination. It was disproportionate in preserving, as Belgium argued, fiscal coherence or supervision.</ref> Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of [[Advocate General Maduro]],<ref>See ''[[Commission v Netherlands]]'' (2006) C\u2011282/04, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62004CC0282 AG Maduro's Opinion] on golden shares in KPN NV and TPG NV.</ref> a series of cases held that government owned [[golden shares]] were unlawful. In ''[[Commission v Germany (2007)|Commission v Germany]]'' the Commission claimed the German [[Volkswagen Act 1960]] violated article 63, in that \u00a72(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and \u00a74(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the [[Lower Saxony]] government to block any decisions.

The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service.<ref>(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-157/99], [48]-[55]</ref> National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary.<ref>(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-157/99], [94] and [104]-[106]</ref> The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's [[National Health Service]].<ref>See ''[[Watts v Bedford Primary Care Trust]]'' (2006) C-372/04 and ''[[Commission v Spain]]'' (2010) C-211/08</ref> Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. ''[[Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht]]'' held that the Netherlands' regulation of [[cannabis]] consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]],<ref>(2010) C\u2011137/09, [2010] I-13019</ref> fell outside article 56 altogether. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.\n\nIf an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or over-riding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In ''[[Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn]]''<ref>(1995) C-384/93, [1995] ECR I-1141</ref> a business that sold [[commodities]] [[futures contract|futures]] (with [[Merrill Lynch]] and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting [[cold calling]] customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In ''[[Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn]]''<ref>(2004) C-36/02, [2004] ECR I-9609</ref> a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the [[Bonn]] council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of [[human dignity]], which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In ''[[Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa]]'' the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a [[Gibraltar]] firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent.<ref>(2009) C\u201142/07, [2007] ECR I-7633</ref> The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state.<ref>[[Free Movement of Workers Regulation]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32011R0492 492/2011] arts 1\u20134</ref> In a famous case, the ''[[Belgian Football Association v Bosman]]'', a Belgian footballer named [[Jean-Marc Bosman]] claimed that he should be able to transfer from [[R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge]] to [[USL Dunkerque]] when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees.<ref>(1995) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415 C-415/93]</ref> The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In ''[[Groener v Minister for Education]]''<ref>(1989) Case 379/87, [1989] ECR 3967</ref> the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to teach in a [[Dublin]] design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in ''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]''<ref>(2000) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61998CJ0281 C-281/98], [2000] ECR I-4139, [36]-[44]</ref> a bank in [[Bolzano]], Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to [[TFEU]] article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In ''[[Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker]]''<ref>(1995) C-279/93</ref> the Court of Justice held that it contravened [[TFEU]] art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in ''[[Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg]]'' the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified.<ref>(2004) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62001CJ0387&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-387/01], [54]-[55]</ref> Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In ''[[Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands.<ref>(2007) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62005CJ0287 C-287/05], [55]</ref> Conversely, in ''[[Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits,<ref>(2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=62748&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=66471 C-213/05]</ref> even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.<ref>''[[Hartmann v Freistaat Bayern]]'' (2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=62747&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=70077 C-212/05]. Discussed in C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the European Union'' (2013) ch 9, 293\u2013294</ref> The general justifications for limiting free movement in [[TFEU]] article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\",<ref>See ''[[Van Duyn v Home Office]]'' Case 41/74, [1974] ECR 1337</ref> and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".\n\nFor workers not citizens of the union but employed in one member state with work permit, there is not the same freedom of movement within the Union. They need to apply for a new work permit if wanting to work in a different state. A facilitation mechanism for this process is the [[Van Der Elst visa]] which gives easier rules should a non-EU worker already in one EU state need to be sent to another, for the same employer, because of a service contract that the employer made with a customer in that other state.\n\n====Free movement of citizens====\n{{Clist citizen rights}}\n{{see also|Citizenship of the European Union}}\nBeyond the right of free movement to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply by being a [[Human rights|human being]].<ref>See NN Shuibhne, \u2018The Resilience of EU Market Citizenship\u2019 (2010) 47 CMLR 1597 and HP Ipsen, ''Europ\u00e4isches Gemeinschaftsrecht'' (1972) on the concept of a \u2018market citizen\u2019 (''Marktb\u00fcrger'').</ref> But although the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] stated that \u2018Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States\u2019,<ref>''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d\u2019Aide Sociale d\u2019Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]'' (2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193</ref> political debate remains on who should have access to public services and welfare systems funded by taxation.<ref>See T Marshall, ''Citizenship and Social Class'' (1950) 28-9, positing that \u2018citizenship\u2019 passed from civil rights, political rights, to social rights, and [[JHH Weiler]], \u2018The European Union belongs to its citizens: Three immodest proposals\u2019 (1997) [http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415458511/parts/part-2/students/articles/weiler-article.rtf 22 European Law Review 150]</ref> In 2008, just 8 million people from 500&nbsp;million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority of them workers.<ref>''5th Report on Citizenship of the Union'' COM(2008) 85.

Article 21 confers general rights to free movement in the EU and to reside freely within limits set by legislation. This applies for citizens and their immediate family members.<ref>[[CRD 2004]] art 2(2) defines \u2018family member\u2019 as a spouse, long term partner, descendant under 21 or depednant elderly relative that is accompanying the citizen.

See also, ''[[R (Secretary of State for the Home Department) v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh]]'' [1992] 3 CMLR 358</ref> This triggers four main groups of rights: (1) to enter, depart and return, without undue restrictions, (2) to reside, without becoming an unreasonable burden on social assistance, (3) to vote in local and European elections, and (4) the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host state, but for social assistance only after 3 months of residence.\n\n[[File:Sanctuary - Berlin Wall.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] (1961\u20131989) symbolised a bordered globe, where citizens of East Germany had no right to leave, and few could enter. The EU has progressively dismantled barriers to free movement, consistent with economic development.]]\nFirst, article 4 of the [[Citizens Rights Directive 2004]] says every citizen has the right to depart a member state with a valid [[Passports of the European Union|passport]] or [[National identity cards in the European Economic Area|national identity card]]. This has historical importance for central and eastern Europe, when the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Berlin Wall]] denied its citizens the freedom to leave.<ref>See also the [[Communist Manifesto]]</ref> Article 5 gives every citizen a right of entry, subject to national border controls. [[Schengen Area]] countries (of which Ireland is not included) have abolished the need to show travel documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in [[TFEU]] article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of \"sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system\". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, [[Treaty on European Union|TEU]] article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the [[European Parliament]] wherever a citizen lives.\n\n[[File:Children in a Primary Education School.JPG|thumb|right|All EU citizens have the right to [[child support]], education, [[social security]] and other assistance in EU member states. To ensure people contribute fairly to the communities they live in, there can be qualifying periods of residence and work up to five years.]]\nFourth, and more debated, article 24 requires that the longer an EU citizen stays in a host state, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services, on the basis of [[equal treatment]]. This reflects general principles of equal treatment and citizenship in [[TFEU]] articles 18 and 20. In a simple case, in ''[[Sala v Freistaat Bayern]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a Spanish woman who had lived in (Germany) for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to [[child support]], without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one.<ref>(1998) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61996CJ0085 C-85/96], [1998] ECR I-2691</ref> In ''[[Trojani v Centre public d\u2019aide sociale de Bruxelles]]'', a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the \"minimex\" allowance from the state for a minimum living wage.<ref>(2004) C-456/02, [2004] ECR I-07573</ref> In ''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d\u2019Aide Sociale d\u2019Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]''<ref>(2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193</ref> a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the \"minimex\" income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in ''[[R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that it was lawful to require a French [[University College London|UCL]] economics student to have lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional \"settled status\".<ref>(2005) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62003CJ0209&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C-209/03], [2005] ECR I-2119</ref> Similarly, in ''[[Commission v Austria]]'', Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid \"structural, staffing and financial problems\" if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem.<ref>(2005) C-147/03</ref> However, in ''[[Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig]]'', the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny [[child support]] to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of \"sufficient resources\", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7.<ref>(2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0333&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre= C\u2011333/13]</ref>\n\n====Schengen Area====\n{{Main|Schengen Area}}\n\nWithin the [[Schengen Area]] 22 of 28 EU member states (excluding [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], Ireland, [[Romania]] and the United Kingdom) and the four [[EFTA]] members ([[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], and [[Switzerland]]) have abolished physical barriers across the single market by eliminating border controls.
