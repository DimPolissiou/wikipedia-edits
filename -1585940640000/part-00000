A total of 16 illustrations are extant: two sets of six [[watercolour]]s each, and an additional four drawings in pencil. \n\nThe dating of the sets is unknown, as is Blake's intended sequence for the illustrations. The two sets of watercolours are known as the \"Butts set\" and the \"Thomas set\", after their respective patrons, or as the \"Huntington set\" and the \"Whitworth set\" after the [[Huntington Library]] and the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], which now hold the sets in their collections.\n\n==Provenance==\nThere is little record of the [[provenance]] of the Thomas set or the Butts set before 1852 and 1872, which has led to disputes about the dating. What is known is that the \"Thomas set\" was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas,<ref name = Butlin389> Butlin 389</ref> who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton's ''[[Comus (poem)|Comus]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' from Blake. No contract for the commission is extant, but the commissioning probably took place in 1809, which is the year in which the illustrations were completed.<ref name = Butlin389 /> Blake was eager to accept the commission, according to G. E. Bentley, because \"Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist.\"<ref>Bentley 2003 p. 357</ref> They presumably stayed in the Revd Thomas's family until they were bought at [[Sotheby's]] from an anonymous seller in 1872. By 1876 they were in the collection of J.E. Taylor, who gave them to the Whitworth in 1892.<ref name = Butlin389 /> \n\nEven less is known about the dates of composition for the \"Butts set\" - between 1811 and 1820, Blake created at least thirty three designs for [[Thomas Butts]], which included the illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''.<ref>Bentley 2003 p. 288</ref> Later, they passed from Butts to his son, who sold them at Sotheby's in 1852, passed through several more hands, were sold at [[Christie's]] in 1912, and in 1916 were sold to [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]].<ref> Butlin 393</ref>\n\n[[File:Onthemorningthomas4.jpg|thumb|''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'', watercolour, 25 x 19.3 cm, 1809.

''Blake's Illustrations to Milton's Nativity Ode'', in [[Philological Quarterly]], LV, Winter 1976, pp. 65-95. Quoted in Butlin, 390</ref> and Collins Baker and R.R.

Wark, ''Catalogue of William Blake's Drawings and Paintings in the Huntington Library''. First published 1938. Quoted in Butlin, 390</ref>\n\nThe sequence of the illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute: the mountings of the Thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1\u20136, but these were added during or after the 1872 Sotheby's sale, and so are unlikely to follow Blake's intended order.<ref name=Butlin390 />  This \"original\" order ran thus: \n\n#''The Descent of Peace''\n#''The Annunciation to the Shepherds''\n#''The Flight of Moloch''\n#''The Old Dragon''\n#''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods''\n#''The Night of Peace'' \n\n[[Geoffrey Keynes]] placed them in 1-6-2-3-4-5 order, so that ''The Night of Peace'' followed ''The Descent of Peace'', because of their similar subjects.<ref>Keynes, Geoffrey.

Quoted in Butlin, 390 </ref> [[Martin Butlin|Butlin]], and nearly all subsequent scholars, have rejected this, as much commentary has centered upon Blake's use of similar images to frame the sequence. Butlin instead rearranges the \"original\" sequence as 1-2-4-5-3-6, moving ''The Flight of Moloch'' to second to last, so that it matches the order of corresponding verses in Milton's poem.<ref name=Butlin390 /> Dunbar also follows Butlin's order. Behrendt adopts a 1-2-5-3-4-6 order, seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics, to the Old Testament cruelty of Moloch (who resembles Blake's [[Urizen]]), to [[Satan]] himself.<ref>Behrendt 40-41</ref> This order is followed by Werner in her ''Blake's Vision of the Poetry of Milton''.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Onthemorningthomas5.jpg|thumb|''The Flight of Moloch'', watercolour, 25.7 x 19.7 cm. 1809]]\nBlake's literary debt to Milton is key to understanding his illustrations of the earlier poet's writings. In general, ''[[Milton: a Poem]]'' is a guide to Blake's idea of Milton: that he possessed true spiritual vision, but fell by his adherence to the moralistic and repressive tenets of [[puritan|puritanism]] and by his preference for the cruel and distant [[Jehovah]] of the [[Old Testament]] over the redemptive figure of [[Christ]]. In that regard the ''Nativity Ode'' is to Blake the rebirth of Milton's poetry into the creative imagination of Christ.<ref>Behrendt 39</ref> Blake also sees a return to prophetic, Christian ideals of poetry, rather than the \"pagan\" [[Classicism|classical aesthetic]] represented in ''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'' by the figure of [[Apollo]], who is modeled on the [[Apollo Belvedere]].<ref>Behrendt 40</ref>  \n\nBlake's [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic book]] ''[[Europe: a Prophecy]]'' was especially influenced by ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''. <ref>Frye 262</ref> In that poem, the messianic [[Orc (Blake)|Orc]], a symbol of pure creative energy, rises against the repressive institutions of Church and state. Orc is part of a doomed cycle- his rebellion is inevitably countered by the increased institutional repression of [[Urizen]].<ref name = Werner117 /> ''Europe'' in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of Milton's poem.<ref>Werner 115</ref> Orc is often associated with fire, and the closest parallel with him is found in ''The Flight of Moloch'', where a child is about to be given to the [[Moloch|god of sacrifice]]. The similarity of the orifice that frames the child to the shape of the stable in the other illustrations underscores the purpose of Christ's birth, and foreshadows the [[Harrowing of Hell|harrowing of hell]].<ref>Werner 130</ref>    \n\nThe illustrations emphasize the simultaneous occurrence of the events they depict by the presence of the stable in almost every image, and by framing the set with two very similar images that focus on the peaceful victory of Christ over darkness.<ref>Dunbar 92</ref> ''The Descent of Peace'' also has [[Neo-Platonism|neo-platonic]] implications- it represents the descent of the soul into the body, which is symbolized by the cramped stable. <ref>Dunbar 94</ref>\n\n==Table of Illustrations==\nThe order followed here is that given by Butlin.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n!

However, both Parton and Houston dispelled any rumors, speaking glowingly of one another in interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/03/lkl.00.html |title=CNN.com \u2013 Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 10, 1993 |first=Anthony |last=DeCurtis |authorlink=Anthony DeCurtis |first2=Albert |last2=Watson |title=Down &amp; Dirty}} From copy posted at {{cite web|url=http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/rollingstone_1993.htm |title=Interview: Rolling Stone 1993 |publisher=classicwhitney.com |date=June 10, 1993 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song. In return, Parton thanked Houston for bringing her song to a wider audience and increasing the amount of [[royalties]] for her song in the process. Dolly Parton also gave a live interview, confirming this.\n\nWhen Houston won the Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female award at the 1994 Grammy Awards for the recording, Parton (along with [[David Foster]]) presented her with the award.\n\nIn a statement to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' on the day of Houston's death in February 2012, Parton said:<blockquote>Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/506200/dolly-parton-whitney-i-will-always-love-you |title=Dolly Parton: 'Whitney, I Will Always Love You' |work=Billboard |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Music video===\nThe single's music video is credited to [[Alan Smithee]] ([[Nick Brandt]] removed his name due to the way [[Clive Davis]] re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of ''The Bodyguard''. The video then cuts to Houston in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love, and at the end of the video, Houston's theater changes into open camp circled by snow, which is meant to be at Fallen Leaf Lake, California, where The Bodyguard's boat scene was filmed. The video is inter-cut with scenes from ''The Bodyguard'' and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer. At the time of the video's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina, so Houston is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679194/whitney-houston-greatest-videos.jhtml |title=Whitney Houston's Greatest Videos |publisher=MTV |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref>\n\n===Formats and track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n''''UK / Europe 12\" vinyl single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = [[Whitney Houston]] |year = 1992 | type = UK 12-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = [[Arista Records|Arista]] | location = United Kingdom | id = 74321 12065 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe 12-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 1}}</ref>\n* A \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n* B1 \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" \u2013 5:11\n* B2 \"[[Do You Hear What I Hear?]]\" \u2013 3:31\n\n'''UK / Europe / US 7\" vinyl single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = UK 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United Kingdom | id = 74321 12065 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = US 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United States | id = 07822-12490-7}}</ref>\n* A \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n* B \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" \u2013 5:11\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''US / Europe Maxi-CD single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = US Maxi-CD Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United States | id = 07822-12503-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe Maxi-CD Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records, BMG Eurodisc | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 2}}</ref>\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n# \"Jesus Loves Me\" \u2013 5:11\n# \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \u2013 3:31\n\n'''Maxi-CD singles (1999 Remixes)'''\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" ([[Hex Hector]] Radio Edit) \u2013 4:50\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" (Hex Hector 12\" Club Mix) \u2013 9:51\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" (Hex Hector Anthem Dub Mix) \u2013 5:44\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Credits and personnel===\n<!-- Adapted from The Bodyguard OST liner notes -->\n* Performed by [[Whitney Houston]]\n* Produced and arranged by [[David Foster]]\n* Vocal arrangement&nbsp;\u2013 Whitney Houston\n* Directed by [[Rickey Minor]]\n* Keyboards \u2013 David Foster\n* Sax solo&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kirk Whalum]]\n* Drums&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ricky Lawson]]\n* Percussion - [[Bashiri Johnson]]\n* Guitars \u2013 [[Dean Parks]], [[Michael Landau]]\n* Bass \u2013 [[Neil Stubenhaus]]\n* Synth programmers \u2013 Tony Smith, Claude Gaudette\n* String arrangements&nbsp;\u2013 Ronn Huff\n* Recording engineers&nbsp;\u2013 Bill Schnee, Dave Reitzas, Peter J.

The 2010 BET Honors Awards was held at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.\nSince Houston's death in 2012, many other artists have performed tributes to the late singer's version of the song, including on February 12, 2012, when Hudson performed the song as a tribute during the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], the day after Houston's death, alongside images of musicians who had died in 2011 and 2012, including [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Etta James]]. The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,<blockquote>I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang \"I Will Always Love You\" on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. Like everybody else, I am still in shock. But I know that Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind.

However, both Parton and Houston dispelled any rumors, speaking glowingly of one another in interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/03/lkl.00.html |title=CNN.com \u2013 Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 10, 1993 |first=Anthony |last=DeCurtis |authorlink=Anthony DeCurtis |first2=Albert |last2=Watson |title=Down &amp; Dirty}} From copy posted at {{cite web|url=http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/rollingstone_1993.htm |title=Interview: Rolling Stone 1993 |publisher=classicwhitney.com |date=June 10, 1993 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song.

Dolly Parton also gave a live interview, confirming this.\n\nWhen Houston won the Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female award at the 1994 Grammy Awards for the recording, Parton (along with [[David Foster]]) presented her with the award.\n\nIn a statement to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' on the day of Houston's death in February 2012, Parton said:<blockquote>Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/506200/dolly-parton-whitney-i-will-always-love-you |title=Dolly Parton: 'Whitney, I Will Always Love You' |work=Billboard |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Music video===\nThe single's music video is credited to [[Alan Smithee]] ([[Nick Brandt]] removed his name due to the way [[Clive Davis]] re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of ''The Bodyguard''. The video then cuts to Houston in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love, and at the end of the video, Houston's theater changes into open camp circled by snow, which is meant to be at Fallen Leaf Lake, California, where The Bodyguard's boat scene was filmed. The video is inter-cut with scenes from ''The Bodyguard'' and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer. At the time of the video's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina, so Houston is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679194/whitney-houston-greatest-videos.jhtml |title=Whitney Houston's Greatest Videos |publisher=MTV |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref>\n\n===Formats and track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n''''UK / Europe 12\" vinyl single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = [[Whitney Houston]] |year = 1992 | type = UK 12-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = [[Arista Records|Arista]] | location = United Kingdom | id = 74321 12065 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe 12-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 1}}</ref>\n* A \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n* B1 \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" \u2013 5:11\n* B2 \"[[Do You Hear What I Hear?]]\" \u2013 3:31\n\n'''UK / Europe / US 7\" vinyl single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = UK 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United Kingdom | id = 74321 12065 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = US 7-inch Vinyl Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United States | id = 07822-12490-7}}</ref>\n* A \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n* B \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" \u2013 5:11\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''US / Europe Maxi-CD single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = US Maxi-CD Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records | location = United States | id = 07822-12503-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes | title = I Will Always Love You | others = Whitney Houston |year = 1992 | type = Europe Maxi-CD Single liner notes | publisher = Arista Records, BMG Eurodisc | location = Europe | id = 74321 12065 2}}</ref>\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2013 4:31\n# \"Jesus Loves Me\" \u2013 5:11\n# \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \u2013 3:31\n\n'''Maxi-CD singles (1999 Remixes)'''\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" ([[Hex Hector]] Radio Edit) \u2013 4:50\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" (Hex Hector 12\" Club Mix) \u2013 9:51\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" (Hex Hector Anthem Dub Mix) \u2013 5:44\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Credits and personnel===\n<!-- Adapted from The Bodyguard OST liner notes -->\n* Performed by [[Whitney Houston]]\n* Produced and arranged by [[David Foster]]\n* Vocal arrangement&nbsp;\u2013 Whitney Houston\n* Directed by [[Rickey Minor]]\n* Keyboards \u2013 David Foster\n* Sax solo&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kirk Whalum]]\n* Drums&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ricky Lawson]]\n* Percussion - [[Bashiri Johnson]]\n* Guitars \u2013 [[Dean Parks]], [[Michael Landau]]\n* Bass \u2013 [[Neil Stubenhaus]]\n* Synth programmers \u2013 Tony Smith, Claude Gaudette\n* String arrangements&nbsp;\u2013 Ronn Huff\n* Recording engineers&nbsp;\u2013 Bill Schnee, Dave Reitzas, Peter J.

The 2010 BET Honors Awards was held at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.\nSince Houston's death in 2012, many other artists have performed tributes to the late singer's version of the song, including on February 12, 2012, when Hudson performed the song as a tribute during the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], the day after Houston's death, alongside images of musicians who had died in 2011 and 2012, including [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Etta James]]. The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,<blockquote>I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang \"I Will Always Love You\" on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. Like everybody else, I am still in shock. But I know that Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind.

The first journey,{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13\u201314}} for which Paul and Barnabas were commissioned by the Antioch community,{{sfn|Dunn|2009|p=370}} and led initially by Barnabas,{{refn|group=note|The only indication as to who is leading is in the order of names. At first, the two are referred to as Barnabas and Paul, in that order. Later in the same chapter the team is referred to as Paul and his companions.}} took Barnabas and Paul from Antioch to Cyprus then into southern Asia Minor (Anatolia), and finally returning to Antioch. In Cyprus, Paul rebukes and blinds [[Elymas]] the magician{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:8\u201312}} who was criticizing their teachings.\n\nThey sail to [[Perga]] in [[Pamphylia]]. [[John Mark]] leaves them and returns to Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas go on to [[Antioch of Pisidia|Pisidian Antioch]]. On [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] they go to the synagogue. The leaders invite them to speak. Paul reviews Israelite history from life in Egypt to King David. He introduces Jesus as a descendant of David brought to Israel by God. He said that his team came to town to bring the message of salvation. He recounts the story of Jesus' death and resurrection. He quotes from the [[Septuagint]]<ref name=\"JewEnc:Saul of Tarsus\" /> to assert that Jesus was the promised [[Christ]]os who brought them forgiveness for their sins. Both the Jews and the \"[[God-fearer|God-fearing]]\" Gentiles invited them to talk more next Sabbath. At that time almost the whole city gathered. This upset some influential Jews who spoke against them. Paul used the occasion to announce a change in his mission which from then on would be to the Gentiles.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:13\u201348}}\n\nAntioch served as a major Christian homebase for Paul's early missionary activities,{{sfn|Harris|2003|p=}} and he remained there for \"a long time with the disciples\"{{Bibleref2c|Acts|14:28|NKJV}} at the conclusion of his first journey. The exact duration of Paul's stay in Antioch is unknown, with estimates ranging from nine months to as long as eight years.{{sfn|Spence-Jones|2015|p=16}}\n\nIn Raymond Brown's ''An Introduction to the New Testament'' (1997), a chronology of events in Paul's life is presented, illustrated from later 20th century writings of [[biblical scholar]]s.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=445}} The first missionary journey of Paul is assigned a \"traditional\" (and majority) dating of 46\u201349 AD, compared to a \"revisionist\" (and minority) dating of after 37 AD.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=428\u201329}}\n\n==== Council of Jerusalem ====\n{{Main|Council of Jerusalem}}\n{{See also|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}} \n\nA vital meeting between Paul and the Jerusalem church took place in the year 49 by \"traditional\" (and majority) dating, compared to a \"revisionist\" (and minority) dating of 47/51.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp= 428\u201329, 445}} The meeting is described in {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:2|NIV}} and usually seen as the same event mentioned by Paul in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:1|NIV}}.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=St Paul}} The key question raised was whether [[Gentile]] converts needed to be circumcised.{{sfn|Bechtel|1910}}{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15:2|NIV}}{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|2:1|NIV}} At this meeting, Paul states in his letter to the Galatians, [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James (brother of Jesus)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] accepted Paul's mission to the Gentiles.\n\nThe Jerusalem meetings are mentioned in Acts, and also in Paul's letters.{{sfn|White|2007|pp=148\u201349}} For example, the Jerusalem visit for famine relief{{Bibleref2c|Acts|11:27\u201330}} apparently corresponds to the \"first visit\" (to Peter and James only).{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|1:18\u201320}}{{sfn|White|2007|pp=148\u201349}} [[F.

How is it, then, that you [[Judaizers|force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs]]?\"{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|2:11\u201314}} Paul also mentions that even Barnabas, his traveling companion and fellow apostle until that time, sided with Peter.{{sfn|Bechtel|1910}}\n\nThe final outcome of the incident remains uncertain. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' suggests that Paul won the argument, because \"Paul's account of the incident leaves no doubt that Peter saw the justice of the rebuke\".{{sfn|Bechtel|1910}} However Paul himself never mentions a victory and {{nowrap|[[L. Michael White]]'s}} ''From Jesus to Christianity'' draws the opposite conclusion: \"The blowup with Peter was a total failure of political bravado, and Paul soon left Antioch as ''persona non grata'', never again to return\".{{sfn|White|2007|p=170}}\n\nThe primary source account of the Incident at Antioch is Paul's [[Epistle to the Galatians|letter to the Galatians]].{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|2:11\u201314}}\n\n==== Second missionary journey ====\n[[File:V&A - Raphael, St Paul Preaching in Athens (1515).jpg|thumb|Saint Paul delivering the ''[[Areopagus sermon]]'' in [[Athens]], by [[Raphael]], 1515.

On their trip around the Mediterranean Sea, Paul and his companion Barnabas stopped in Antioch where they had a sharp argument about taking [[John Mark]] with them on their trips. The book of Acts said that John Mark had left them in a previous trip and gone home. Unable to resolve the dispute, Paul and Barnabas decided to separate; Barnabas took John Mark with him, while [[Silas]] joined Paul.\n\nPaul and Silas initially visited [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Paul's birthplace), [[Derbe]] and [[Lystra]]. In Lystra, they met [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], a disciple who was spoken well of, and decided to take him with them. Paul and his companions, Silas and Timothy, had plans to journey to the southwest portion of Asia Minor to preach the gospel but during the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him to go to Macedonia to help them. After seeing the vision, Paul and his companions left for Macedonia to preach the gospel to them.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:6\u201310|9|Acts 16:6\u201310}} The Church kept growing, adding believers, and strengthening in faith daily.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:5|KJV}}\n\nIn [[Philippi]], Paul cast a spirit of divination out of a servant girl, whose masters were then unhappy about the loss of income her soothsaying provided.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:16\u201324|9|Acts 16:16\u201324}} They turned the city against the missionaries, and Paul and Silas were put in jail.

Paul continued from Athens to [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]].\n\n====Interval in Corinth====\nAround 50\u201352, Paul spent 18 months in Corinth. The reference in Acts to Proconsul [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Gallio]] helps ascertain this date (cf. [[Delphi Inscription|Gallio Inscription]]).{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=St Paul}} In Corinth, Paul met [[Priscilla and Aquila]],{{bibleref2c|Acts|18:2|NKJV}} who became faithful believers and helped Paul through his other missionary journeys.

Theologian Mark Powell writes that Paul directed these 7 letters to specific occasions at particular churches. As an example, if the Corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the [[Agape feast|Lord's Supper]],{{Bibleref2c|1cor|11:17\u201334||1 Cor. 11:17\u201334}} today we would not know that Paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about it one way or the other. Powell asks if we might be ignorant of other matters simply because no crises arose that prompted Paul to comment on them.{{sfn|Powell|2009|p=234}}\n\nIn Paul's writings, he provides the first written account of what it is to be a Christian and thus a description of Christian spirituality. His letters have been characterized as being the most influential books of the New Testament after the Gospels of Matthew and John.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}{{refn|group=note|Sanders: \"Paul [...] only occasionally had the opportunity to revisit his churches.

Fortunately, after his death one of his followers collected some of the letters, edited them very slightly, and published them. They constitute one of history's most remarkable personal contributions to religious thought and practice.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\n[[File:Probably Valentin de Boulogne - Saint Paul Writing His Epistles - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Paul Writing His Epistles'', painting attributed to [[Valentin de Boulogne]], 17th century]]\n{{Main|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}\n\nSeven of the 13 letters that bear Paul's name \u2013 [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[1 Corinthians]], [[2 Corinthians]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], [[Philippians]], [[1 Thessalonians]] and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] \u2013 are almost universally accepted as being entirely authentic (dictated by Paul himself).{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}{{sfn|Aune|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Dunn| Rogerson|2003|p=1274}}{{sfn|Perkins|1988|pp=4-7}} They are considered the best source of information on Paul's life and especially his thought.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}\n\nFour of the letters (Ephesians, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus) are widely considered [[pseudepigraphical]], while the authorship of the other two is subject to debate.{{sfn|Aune|2010|p=9}} Colossians and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians are possibly \"Deutero-Pauline\" meaning they may have been written by Paul's followers after his death. Similarly, 1&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;Timothy, and Titus may be \"Trito-Pauline\" meaning they may have been written by members of the Pauline school a generation after his death. According to their theories, these disputed letters may have come from followers writing in Paul's name, often using material from his surviving letters. These scribes also may have had access to letters written by Paul that no longer survive.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}\n\nThe authenticity of Colossians has been questioned on the grounds that it contains an otherwise unparalleled description (among his writings) of Jesus as \"the image of the invisible God\", a Christology found elsewhere only in John's gospel.{{sfn|MacDonald|Harrington|2000|p=58}} However, the personal notes in the letter connect it to Philemon, unquestionably the work of Paul. Internal evidence shows close connection with Philippians.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n\nEphesians is a letter that is very similar to Colossians, but is almost entirely lacking in personal reminiscences. Its style is unique. It lacks the emphasis on the cross to be found in other Pauline writings, reference to the [[Second Coming]] is missing, and [[Christian views of marriage|Christian marriage]] is exalted in a way which contrasts with the reference in {{Bibleref2|1Cor|7:8\u20139||1&nbsp;Cor. 7:8\u20139}}. Finally, according to [[Raymond E. Brown|R.E. Brown]], it exalts the Church in a way suggestive of a second generation of Christians, \"built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets\" now past.{{sfn|Brown|1984|p=48}}\n\nThe defenders of its Pauline authorship argue that it was intended to be read by a number of different churches and that it marks the final stage of the development of Paul's thinking. It has been said, too, that the moral portion of the Epistle, consisting of the last two chapters, has the closest affinity with similar portions of other Epistles, while the whole admirably fits in with the known details of Paul's life, and throws considerable light upon them.{{sfn|Aherne|1908}}\n\n[[File:Paul Apostle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Apostle Paul, 18th century ([[Iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] Monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]])]]\n\nThree main reasons have been advanced by those who question Paul's authorship of 1&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;Timothy, and Titus&nbsp;\u2013 also known as the [[Pastoral Epistles]].\n* First, they have found a difference in these letters' vocabulary, style, and [[Christian theology|theology]] from Paul's acknowledged writings. Defenders of the authenticity say that they were probably written in the name and with the authority of the Apostle by one of his companions, to whom he distinctly explained what had to be written, or to whom he gave a written summary of the points to be developed, and that when the letters were finished, Paul read them through, approved them, and signed them.{{sfn|Aherne|1908}}\n* Second, there is a difficulty in fitting them into Paul's biography as we have it.{{sfn|Barrett|1963|pp=4ff}} They, like Colossians and Ephesians, were written from prison but suppose Paul's release and travel thereafter.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n* Third, 2&nbsp;Thessalonians, like Colossians, is questioned on stylistic grounds with, among other peculiarities, a dependence on 1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;\u2013 yet a distinctiveness in language from the Pauline corpus. This, again, is explainable by the possibility that Paul requested one of his companions to write the letter for him under his dictation.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n\n===Acts===\nAlthough approximately half of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] deals with Paul's life and works, the Book of Acts does not refer to Paul writing letters. Historians believe that the author of Acts did not have access to any of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]]. One piece of evidence suggesting this is that Acts never directly quotes from the Pauline epistles. Discrepancies between the Pauline epistles and Acts would further support the conclusion that the author of Acts did not have access to those epistles when composing Acts.{{sfn|Ehrman|2006|p=98}}{{sfn|Williams|1957|pp=22, 240}}\n\nBritish Jewish scholar [[Hyam Maccoby]] contended that the Paul as described in the book of Acts and the view of Paul gleaned from his own writings are very different people. Some difficulties have been noted in the account of his life. Paul as described in the Book of Acts is much more interested in factual history, less in theology; ideas such as justification by faith are absent as are references to the Spirit, according to Maccoby. He also pointed out that there are no references to [[John the Baptist]] in the [[Pauline Epistles]], although Paul mentions him several times in the book of Acts.\n\nOthers have objected that the language of the speeches is too Lukan in style to reflect anyone else's words. Moreover, George Shillington writes that the author of Acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bear his literary and theological marks.{{sfn|Shillington|2007|p=18}} Conversely, Howard Marshall writes that the speeches were not entirely the inventions of the author and while they may not be accurate word-for-word, the author nevertheless records the general idea of them.{{sfn|Marshall |1980|p=42}}\n\n[[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F.

Baur considers the Acts of the Apostles were late and unreliable. This debate has continued ever since, with [[Adolf Deissmann]] (1866\u20131937) and [[Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861\u20131931) emphasising Paul's Greek inheritance and [[Albert Schweitzer]] stressing his dependence on Judaism.\n\n==Views==\n[[File:Saint-Paul.JPG|thumb|Saint Paul, Byzantine ivory relief, 6th \u2013 early 7th century ([[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]])]]\n\n===Self-view===\nIn the opening verses of {{Bibleref2|Romans|1}}, Paul provides a litany of his own apostolic appointment to preach among the Gentiles{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|1:16}} and his post-conversion convictions about the risen Christ.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}} Paul described himself as set apart for the gospel of God and called to be an apostle and a servant of Jesus Christ.

Believers [[Participation in Christ|participate]] in Christ's death and resurrection by their baptism. The resurrection of Jesus was of primary importance to Paul, bringing the promise of salvation to believers. Paul taught that, when Christ returned, those who had died believing in Christ as the saviour of mankind would be brought back to life, while those still alive would be \"caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air\" {{Bibleref2c|1Thes|4:14\u201318||1&nbsp;Thes.&nbsp;4:14\u201318}}{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}\n\nSanders concludes that Paul's writings reveal what he calls the essence of the Christian message: \"(1) God sent his Son; (2) the Son was crucified and resurrected for the benefit of humanity; (3) the Son would soon return; and (4) those who belonged to the Son would live with him forever. Paul\u2019s gospel, like those of others, also included (5) the admonition to live by the highest moral standard: \u201cMay your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d  ({{Bibleref2c|1Thes|5:23||1&nbsp;Thes.&nbsp;5:23}})\"{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}\n\nIn Paul's writings, the public, corporate devotional patterns towards Jesus in the early Christian community are reflective of Paul's perspective on the divine status of Jesus in what scholars have termed a \"binitarian\" pattern of devotion.

Before the [[Judaism's view of Jesus#Positive historical reevaluations|positive historical reevaluations of Jesus]] by some Jewish thinkers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, he had hardly featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the [[Talmud]] and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic [[Toledot Yeshu]] (as a particularly effective spy for the rabbis).<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=23\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, with Jesus no longer regarded as the paradigm of gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured as the key to building barriers (e.g. [[Heinrich Graetz]] and [[Martin Buber]]) or bridges (e.g. [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] and [[Claude G. Montefiore]]) in interfaith relations,<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=57\u201396}}</ref> as part of an intra-Jewish debate about what constitutes Jewish authenticity (e.g. [[Joseph Klausner]] and Hans Joachim Schoeps),<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=97\u2013153}}</ref> and on occasion as a dialogical partner (e.g. [[Richard L.

[[Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas]] wrote that Paul misrepresented the message of Jesus,{{sfn|Riddell|2001|p=235}} and [[Rashid Rida]] accused Paul of introducing [[Shirk (Islam)|''shirk'' (polytheism)]] into Christianity.{{sfn|Waardenburg|1999|p=276}} [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] quoted [[Adolf von Harnack]]'s critical writings of Paul.{{sfn|Waardenburg|1999|p=255}}\n\nIn [[Sunni]] Muslim polemics, Paul plays the same role (of deliberately corrupting the early teachings of Jesus) as a later Jew, [[Abdullah ibn Saba']], would  play in seeking to destroy the message of Islam from within (by introducing proto-Shi'ite beliefs).{{sfn|Anthony|2011|p=68}}{{sfn|Brann|2010|pp=65-66}}{{sfn|Pall|2013|p=55}} Among those who supported this view were scholars [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (who believed while Paul ultimately succeeded, Ibn Saba failed) and [[Ibn Hazm]] (who claimed that the Jews even admitted to Paul's sinister purpose).{{sfn|Adang|1996|pp=105-106}}\n\n=== Other views ===\nAmong the critics of Paul the Apostle was [[Thomas Jefferson]], a [[Deist]], who wrote that Paul was the \"first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.\"<ref>''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: Being his Autobiography, Correspondence, Reports, Messages, Addresses, and Other Writings, Official and Private.

Adopting his Roman name was typical of Paul's missionary style.

[[John Mark]] leaves them and returns to Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas go on to [[Antioch of Pisidia|Pisidian Antioch]]. On [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] they go to the synagogue. The leaders invite them to speak. Paul reviews Israelite history from life in Egypt to King David. He introduces Jesus as a descendant of David brought to Israel by God. He said that his team came to town to bring the message of salvation. He recounts the story of Jesus' death and resurrection. He quotes from the [[Septuagint]]<ref name=\"JewEnc:Saul of Tarsus\" /> to assert that Jesus was the promised [[Christ]]os who brought them forgiveness for their sins. Both the Jews and the \"[[God-fearer|God-fearing]]\" Gentiles invited them to talk more next Sabbath. At that time almost the whole city gathered. This upset some influential Jews who spoke against them.

Unable to resolve the dispute, Paul and Barnabas decided to separate; Barnabas took John Mark with him, while [[Silas]] joined Paul.\n\nPaul and Silas initially visited [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Paul's birthplace), [[Derbe]] and [[Lystra]]. In Lystra, they met [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], a disciple who was spoken well of, and decided to take him with them. Paul and his companions, Silas and Timothy, had plans to journey to the southwest portion of Asia Minor to preach the gospel but during the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him to go to Macedonia to help them. After seeing the vision, Paul and his companions left for Macedonia to preach the gospel to them.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:6\u201310|9|Acts 16:6\u201310}} The Church kept growing, adding believers, and strengthening in faith daily.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:5|KJV}}\n\nIn [[Philippi]], Paul cast a spirit of divination out of a servant girl, whose masters were then unhappy about the loss of income her soothsaying provided.{{bibleref2c|Acts|16:16\u201324|9|Acts 16:16\u201324}} They turned the city against the missionaries, and Paul and Silas were put in jail.

As an example, if the Corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the [[Agape feast|Lord's Supper]],{{Bibleref2c|1cor|11:17\u201334||1 Cor. 11:17\u201334}} today we would not know that Paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about it one way or the other.

Similarly, 1&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;Timothy, and Titus may be \"Trito-Pauline\" meaning they may have been written by members of the Pauline school a generation after his death. According to their theories, these disputed letters may have come from followers writing in Paul's name, often using material from his surviving letters. These scribes also may have had access to letters written by Paul that no longer survive.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}}\n\nThe authenticity of Colossians has been questioned on the grounds that it contains an otherwise unparalleled description (among his writings) of Jesus as \"the image of the invisible God\", a Christology found elsewhere only in John's gospel.{{sfn|MacDonald|Harrington|2000|p=58}} However, the personal notes in the letter connect it to Philemon, unquestionably the work of Paul. Internal evidence shows close connection with Philippians.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n\nEphesians is a letter that is very similar to Colossians, but is almost entirely lacking in personal reminiscences. Its style is unique. It lacks the emphasis on the cross to be found in other Pauline writings, reference to the [[Second Coming]] is missing, and [[Christian views of marriage|Christian marriage]] is exalted in a way which contrasts with the reference in {{Bibleref2|1Cor|7:8\u20139||1&nbsp;Cor. 7:8\u20139}}. Finally, according to [[Raymond E. Brown|R.E.

It has been said, too, that the moral portion of the Epistle, consisting of the last two chapters, has the closest affinity with similar portions of other Epistles, while the whole admirably fits in with the known details of Paul's life, and throws considerable light upon them.{{sfn|Aherne|1908}}\n\n[[File:Paul Apostle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Apostle Paul, 18th century ([[Iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] Monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]])]]\n\nThree main reasons have been advanced by those who question Paul's authorship of 1&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;Timothy, and Titus&nbsp;\u2013 also known as the [[Pastoral Epistles]].\n* First, they have found a difference in these letters' vocabulary, style, and [[Christian theology|theology]] from Paul's acknowledged writings. Defenders of the authenticity say that they were probably written in the name and with the authority of the Apostle by one of his companions, to whom he distinctly explained what had to be written, or to whom he gave a written summary of the points to be developed, and that when the letters were finished, Paul read them through, approved them, and signed them.{{sfn|Aherne|1908}}\n* Second, there is a difficulty in fitting them into Paul's biography as we have it.{{sfn|Barrett|1963|pp=4ff}} They, like Colossians and Ephesians, were written from prison but suppose Paul's release and travel thereafter.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n* Third, 2&nbsp;Thessalonians, like Colossians, is questioned on stylistic grounds with, among other peculiarities, a dependence on 1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;\u2013 yet a distinctiveness in language from the Pauline corpus. This, again, is explainable by the possibility that Paul requested one of his companions to write the letter for him under his dictation.{{sfn|Prat|1911}}\n\n===Acts===\nAlthough approximately half of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] deals with Paul's life and works, the Book of Acts does not refer to Paul writing letters. Historians believe that the author of Acts did not have access to any of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]]. One piece of evidence suggesting this is that Acts never directly quotes from the Pauline epistles. Discrepancies between the Pauline epistles and Acts would further support the conclusion that the author of Acts did not have access to those epistles when composing Acts.{{sfn|Ehrman|2006|p=98}}{{sfn|Williams|1957|pp=22, 240}}\n\nBritish Jewish scholar [[Hyam Maccoby]] contended that the Paul as described in the book of Acts and the view of Paul gleaned from his own writings are very different people. Some difficulties have been noted in the account of his life. Paul as described in the Book of Acts is much more interested in factual history, less in theology; ideas such as justification by faith are absent as are references to the Spirit, according to Maccoby. He also pointed out that there are no references to [[John the Baptist]] in the [[Pauline Epistles]], although Paul mentions him several times in the book of Acts.\n\nOthers have objected that the language of the speeches is too Lukan in style to reflect anyone else's words. Moreover, George Shillington writes that the author of Acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bear his literary and theological marks.{{sfn|Shillington|2007|p=18}} Conversely, Howard Marshall writes that the speeches were not entirely the inventions of the author and while they may not be accurate word-for-word, the author nevertheless records the general idea of them.{{sfn|Marshall |1980|p=42}}\n\n[[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F.

Baur considers the Acts of the Apostles were late and unreliable. This debate has continued ever since, with [[Adolf Deissmann]] (1866\u20131937) and [[Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861\u20131931) emphasising Paul's Greek inheritance and [[Albert Schweitzer]] stressing his dependence on Judaism.\n\n==Views==\n[[File:Saint-Paul.JPG|thumb|Saint Paul, Byzantine ivory relief, 6th \u2013 early 7th century ([[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]])]]\n\n===Self-view===\nIn the opening verses of {{Bibleref2|Romans|1}}, Paul provides a litany of his own apostolic appointment to preach among the Gentiles{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|1:16}} and his post-conversion convictions about the risen Christ.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}} Paul described himself as set apart for the gospel of God and called to be an apostle and a servant of Jesus Christ.

Believers [[Participation in Christ|participate]] in Christ's death and resurrection by their baptism. The resurrection of Jesus was of primary importance to Paul, bringing the promise of salvation to believers.

For Paul, Jesus receives prayer (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 12:8-9; 1 Thess. 3:11), the presence of Jesus is confessionally invoked by believers (1 Cor. 16:22; Romans 10:9-13; Phil. 2:10-11), people are baptized in Jesus\u2019 name (1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 6:3), Jesus is the reference in Christian fellowship for a religious ritual meal (the [[Lord\u2019s Supper]]; 1 Cor. 11:17-34 \u2013 in pagan cults, the reference for ritual meals is always to a deity), and Jesus is the source of continuing prophetic oracles to believers (1 Thess. 4:15-17).{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|pp= 134-152}}\n\n=== Atonement ===\n{{Main|Atonement in Christianity}}\n\nPaul taught that Christians are redeemed from sin by Jesus' death and resurrection.

These women include Miriam, Aaron and Moses' sister,{{Bibleref2c|Exod|15:20}} Deborah,{{Bibleref2c|Judges|4:4}} the prophet Isaiah's wife,{{Bibleref2c|Isa.|8:3}} and Huldah, the one who interpreted the Book of the Law discovered in the temple during the days of Josiah.{{Bibleref2c|2Ki|22:14||2 Kings 22:14}} {{Bibleref2c|2Chr|34:22||2 Chron. 34:22}} There were false prophetesses just as there were false prophets.

The Staggs present a serious study of what has been termed the [[New Testament domestic code]], also known as the ''Haustafel''.{{sfn|Stagg|Stagg|1978|p=}} The two main passages that explain these \"household duties\" are Paul's letters to the {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22 \u2013 6:5}} and to the {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18\u20134:1}}. An underlying Household Code is also reflected in four additional Pauline letters and 1 Peter: 1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1ff., 8ff.; 3:1ff., 8ff.; 5:17ff.; 6:1f.; {{Bibleref2|Titus|2:1\u201310}} and {{Bibleref2|1Pet|3:1\u20139||1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:13\u20133:9}}. Biblical scholars have typically treated the ''Haustafel'' in Ephesians as a resource in the debate over the role of women in ministry and in the home.{{sfn|Gombis|2005|pp=317-330}}\nMargaret MacDonald argues that the ''Haustafel'', particularly as it appears in Ephesians, was aimed at \"reducing the tension between community members and outsiders\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2004|p=109}}\n\nE.

Another passage addresses the topic more obliquely: {{Bibleref2|1Tim|1:8\u201311|9|1 Timothy 1:8\u201311}}. Since the nineteenth century, however, most scholars have concluded that [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] (along with [[2 Timothy]] and [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]]) is not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing in Paul's name some time in the late-first-to-mid-2nd century.{{sfn|Ehrman|2000|p= 393}}{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=4}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:San Pablo (1606) - Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Statue of St. Paul (1606) by [[Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez]]]]\n\nPaul's influence on Christian thinking arguably has been more significant than any other New Testament author.{{sfn|Sanders|2019}} Paul declared that \"[[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|Christ is the end of the law]]\",{{Bibleref2c|Romans|10:4|nasb}} exalted the Christian church as the body of Christ, and depicted the world outside the Church as under judgment.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=St Paul}} Paul's writings include the earliest reference to the \"Lord's Supper\",{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:14\u201317||1 Corinthians 10:14\u201317}}{{Bibleref2-nb|1Cor|11:17\u201334}} a rite traditionally identified as the [[Christian communion]] or [[Eucharist]].

Before the [[Judaism's view of Jesus#Positive historical reevaluations|positive historical reevaluations of Jesus]] by some Jewish thinkers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, he had hardly featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the [[Talmud]] and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic [[Toledot Yeshu]] (as a particularly effective spy for the rabbis).<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=23\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, with Jesus no longer regarded as the paradigm of gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured as the key to building barriers (e.g. [[Heinrich Graetz]] and [[Martin Buber]]) or bridges (e.g. [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] and [[Claude G. Montefiore]]) in interfaith relations,<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=57\u201396}}</ref> as part of an intra-Jewish debate about what constitutes Jewish authenticity (e.g. [[Joseph Klausner]] and Hans Joachim Schoeps),<ref>{{harvp|Langton|2010|pp=97\u2013153}}</ref> and on occasion as a dialogical partner (e.g. [[Richard L.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

After a few phone calls, Vivian's women's support group arrives, and what to do about Reggie soon takes second place to what Vivian should do for herself.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Vivian Saunders\n*[[Andrew McCarthy]] as Reggie Barker\n*[[Paige Turco]] as Louise\n*[[Blanche Baker]] as Barbara\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Jennifer\n*[[Adelle Lutz]] as Mari\n*[[Novella Nelson]] as Frances\n*[[Lisa Jane Persky]] as Sarah\n*Michael Mantell as Harold\n*[[Ken Kensei]] as Yoshi\n*[[Bai Ling]] as Norriko\n\n==Release==\nThis film has only been released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] format.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Nusair of [[DVD Talk]] negatively reviewed the film, saying \"By the time we find out what really happened to McCarthy's character, it's impossible to care.\"<ref>[http://www.reelfilm.com/mini17.htm#dead Mini Reviews (May 2002)] DVD Talk</ref>  ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' also negatively reviewed the film, writing \"How did it happen?

''Star Wars'' games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to [[Electronic Arts]].\n\n====Early licensed games (1979\u20131993)====\nThe first era began with the first officially licensed electronic ''Star Wars'' game: [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]'s 1979 table-top ''Star Wars Electronic Battle Command''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Kenner/SWBattleCommand.htm |title=Kenner ''Star Wars'' Battle Command |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Coopee |first=Todd |title=''Star Wars'' Electronic Battle Command Game |url=https://toytales.ca/star-wars-electronic-battle-command-game/ |publisher=ToyTales.ca |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}</ref> In 1982, [[Parker Brothers]] published the first ''Star Wars'' video game for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogost |first1=Ian|authorlink1=Ian Bogost|last2=Montfort|first2=Nick|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|title-link=Racing the Beam}}</ref>, followed soon the year later by ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Arena]]'', the first video game to depict lightsaber combat.

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

They were followed in 1983 by [[Atari]]'s [[rail shooter]] [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'', which used [[vector graphics]] to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/7-30-a-brief-history-of-star-war-games-part-1.html|title=A Brief History of ''Star War'' Games, Part 1 (Slide 1\u20136) |date=May 20, 2007|publisher=[[Tom's Hardware]]|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref> The next game, ''[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984 video game)|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1984), used more traditional [[raster graphics]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi |title=''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' |publisher=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}</ref> while the following ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1985) returned to vector graphics.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=70 |pages=82\u201383 |title=The making of ''The Empire Strikes Back''|date=November 2009}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars (1991 video game)|Star Wars]]'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991, followed by a [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992 video game)|sequel]] the following year.

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

In recent years, this has ranged from writing [[fan fiction]] to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.<ref>{{Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts 'The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | publisher = [[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002}}</ref> Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.<ref>{{Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Academia===\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.
