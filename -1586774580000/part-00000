It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season 3, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.  Although he never explicitly mentions his sexual orientation (he is once described as a \"[[Pansexuality|pansexual]] imp\" by Vice Dean Robert Laybourne), he is an avid [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]], who makes constant and open attempts to flirt with and touch Jeff. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to dress up and come talk to them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Community episodes}}\n{{:List of Community episodes}}\nMost episodes feature titles designed to sound like the names of college courses such as \"Introduction to Film\", \"Anthropology 101\" and \"Cooperative Calligraphy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|title=The One With All the Episode-Title Formulas|work=NY Mag|publisher=Vulture|first=Margaret|last=Lyons|date=May 6, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120134202/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|archive-date=November 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first season premiered on September 17, 2009, in the 9:30 pm ET Thursday timeslot.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Mitovich |title=Fall TV: NBC Announces Premiere Dates |url=https://tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |work=TV Guide |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626200856/http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |archive-date=June 26, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> After three episodes, the show was moved to the 8:00 pm ET timeslot.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season 3, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nEach episode of ''Community'' is written in accordance with [[Dan Harmon]]'s template of \"story circles\" that he developed while at [[Channel 101]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516155548/http://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon|archive-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This writing method was continued through the fourth season without him.

Mrs Kay teaches a class of illiterate pupils, called the \"Progress Class\". At the very last minute, the disciplinarian Deputy Headteacher, Mr Briggs, also joins.\n\n== Plot ==\nSome students from a Progress Class in [[Liverpool]] are going on a trip to [[Conwy Castle]], but they misbehave. Before the trip they leave they buy sweets and the deputy head disciplinarian teacher, Mr Briggs, joins them. On the journey, they make some stops: at a cafe, a zoo, the beach ([[Conwy Castle]]) and (afterwards) a fun fair. Whilst the children shoplift and generally make trouble, an older boy, Reilly hits on his young teacher, Susan, who shakes off his attentions by suggesting he turn his attention to the pretty young Linda, who had been trying it on with her own boyfriend, Colin. At the castle, they end up losing one of the children, Carol.\n\nMr. Briggs finds Carol on the cliffs as she laments the necessity of returning to her troubled home life. He shouts at her to return but when she threatens to jump off the cliff, he softens and gently talks her down. In an uncharacteristic moment, Mr. Briggs takes the children to the fun fair, where Mrs. Kay gently mocks him for enjoying himself, saying she has the photographs to prove he is not all that bad. Briggs offers to develop the photographs for her, but later, after a moments sad reflection, exposes them to the light.\n\n== Analysis ==\n{{Section OR|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe reviewer of the 2010 production wrote: \"Russell has the ability to inject, into what is superficially a jolly knees-up, social comment and human understanding. Amid all the comedy and music is a serious view of kids and education that is the same today as yesterday.\"<ref name=royal2010/>\n\nThe major themes in ''Our Day Out'' are the lack of education, lack of opportunity and deprivation in inner city Liverpool equalling unemployment and no money for education because of this. Willy Russell makes this point very clear to the audience by using characters that the level of deprivation is really effecting e.g. Carol- her lack of education is very obviously troubling her as she would like to get a good job, however is not bright enough to do so because of the lack of education.\n\nCharacters \n*''''''Mrs Helen Kay'''''': Teacher of the Progress Class.\n*'''Susan''': Helps Mrs Kay look after the children.\n*'''Colin''': Another helper of Mrs Kay; he is teased by Reilly & Digga because he is dating Susan.\n*'''Mr John Briggs''': Deputy Headmaster; he is very strict and tries to discipline the children.\n*'''The Headmaster''': Sends Mr Briggs to supervise the children.\n*'''Ronny Radcliffe''': Driver of the coach who gets tricked by Mrs Kay to teach him a lesson about not to be stingy with the kids background.\n\n'''Kids'''\n\n*'''Carol''': First and last character seen in the play. \n*'''Reilly''': Class bully. \n*'''Digga''': Reilly's 'assistant'. \n*'''Linda''': Has a crush on Colin. \n*'''Karen''': Linda's friend; has a crush on Colin. \n*'''Andrews''':  Andrews is addicted to smoking and does not have a very good life at home.

It premi\u00e8red in the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] in 2010.<ref name=royal2010>[http://old.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/Entertainment/Theatre-and-Comedy/Theatre-review-Our-Day-Out-The-Musical-Royal-Court-Liverpool \"Theatre review: ''Our Day Out'' - The Musical/ Royal Court, Liverpool\"] old.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk, 3 September 2010</ref> The updated version was performed outside Liverpool at the [[Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds]] from 24 Aug - 2 September 2017.<ref name=stage/>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe musical is about students from an inner-city school in Liverpool who go on a trip to [[Conwy Castle]] in [[Wales]]. Mrs Kay teaches a class of illiterate pupils, called the \"Progress Class\". At the very last minute, the disciplinarian Deputy Headteacher, Mr Briggs, also joins.\n\n== Plot ==\nSome students from a Progress Class in [[Liverpool]] are going on a trip to [[Conwy Castle]], but they misbehave. Before the trip they leave they buy sweets and the deputy head disciplinarian teacher, Mr Briggs, joins them. On the journey, they make some stops: at a cafe, a zoo, the beach ([[Conwy Castle]]) and (afterwards) a fun fair. Whilst the children shoplift and generally make trouble, an older boy, Reilly hits on his young teacher, Susan, who shakes off his attentions by suggesting he turn his attention to the pretty young Linda, who had been trying it on with her own boyfriend, Colin. At the castle, they end up losing one of the children, Carol.\n\nMr. Briggs finds Carol on the cliffs as she laments the necessity of returning to her troubled home life. He shouts at her to return but when she threatens to jump off the cliff, he softens and gently talks her down. In an uncharacteristic moment, Mr. Briggs takes the children to the fun fair, where Mrs. Kay gently mocks him for enjoying himself, saying she has the photographs to prove he is not all that bad. Briggs offers to develop the photographs for her, but later, after a moments sad reflection, exposes them to the light.\n\n== Analysis ==\n{{Section OR|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe reviewer of the 2010 production wrote: \"Russell has the ability to inject, into what is superficially a jolly knees-up, social comment and human understanding. Amid all the comedy and music is a serious view of kids and education that is the same today as yesterday.\"<ref name=royal2010/>\n\nThe major themes in ''Our Day Out'' are the lack of education, lack of opportunity and deprivation in inner city Liverpool equalling unemployment and no money for education because of this. Willy Russell makes this point very clear to the audience by using characters that the level of deprivation is really effecting e.g. Carol- her lack of education is very obviously troubling her as she would like to get a good job, however is not bright enough to do so because of the lack of education.\n\nCharacters \n*'''Mrs Helen Kay''': Teacher of the Progress Class.\n*'''Susan''': Helps Mrs Kay look after the children.\n*'''Colin''': Another helper of Mrs Kay; he is teased by Reilly & Digga because he is dating Susan.\n*'''Mr John Briggs''': Deputy Headmaster; he is very strict and tries to discipline the children.\n*'''The Headmaster''': Sends Mr Briggs to supervise the children.\n*'''Ronny Suttcliffe''': Driver of the coach who gets tricked by Mrs Kay to teach him a lesson about not to be stingy with the kids background.\n\n'''Kids'''\n\n*'''Carol''': First and last character seen in the play. \n*'''Reilly''': Class bully. \n*'''Digga''': Reilly's 'assistant'. \n*'''Linda''': Has a crush on Colin. \n*'''Karen''': Linda's friend; has a crush on Colin. \n*'''Andrews''':  Andrews is addicted to smoking and does not have a very good life at home.

The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on.

They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many [https://www.livetensionfree.com/how-to-apply-mascara/ mascaras] have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics\u2019 compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]], [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety/cosmetic-products-safety-regulations-2008-as-amended|title=Product safety for manufacturers|work=bis.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety has been a subject of legislation since 1976.

For instance, all annexes of the Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human [[health]].\nUnder the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as \"Responsible Person\".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF \"EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009\"], European Parliament & Council, 30 November 2009, Retrieved 7 April 2015</ref> This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal [[Legal liability|liability]] to ensure that the cosmetics and [[brand]]s they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms.

The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].\n\nThe current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics.

They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry.

Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release [[Male cosmetics|products specially tailored for men]], and men are increasingly using them.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nCosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and \"gifts with purchase\" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).\n\nA beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "name_user": "Livetensionfree", "label": "safe", "comment": "How to apply Mascaras", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}

The name Ucramund appears in documents from 1178. Since May 1, 2013 Ueckerm\u00fcnde has been an officially recognized [[seaside resort]].<ref>[http://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/doberan/index_artikel_komplett.phtml?param=news&id=3760361 Haff-Stadt Ueckerm\u00fcnde ist jetzt offiziell ein Seebad] (Ostsee-Zeitung Online, May 1, 2013)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{wide image|Panorama Altstadt.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|Old Town}}\n[[File:Uede schlossturm.jpg|thumb|Castle tower]]\n[[File:Panorama Marktplatz.jpg|thumb|Historical market square of Ueckerm\u00fcnde]]\n[[File:Uede berggasse.jpg|thumb|Berggasse]]\n[[File:Lubinus Ueckermuende.png|thumb|View on the map at the beginning of the 17th Lubinschen map]]\n[[File:Ackerhof.jpg|thumb|Ackerhof]]\n[[File:Ueckerm\u00fcnde im 17.

The Uecker River flows from [[Brandenburg]], where it is called Ucker, into the [[Oder Lagoon]]. The river's name corresponds to the name of the adjacent region ([[Uckermark]]) and the name of the medieval [[Wends|Wendish]] tribe of the [[Ukrani|Ukr(an)i]] who inhabited the area prior to the German [[Ostsiedlung]] or eastern expansion. The first known reference to Ucramund is in an 1178 document. Later spellings included Ukeremund, Ukeremunde and Ukermunde (1284).\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the old Slavonic era Ueckerm\u00fcnde's location made it a settlement of fishermen. In 1178 (according to other sources 1223) Ucramund was first mentioned and in 1243 the [[Usedom Abbey|Monastery Grobe]] was built in Usedom. In 1260 [[Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania|Barnim I, the duke of Pomerania]], founded a monastery and the original trade center was awarded a town charter under [[L\u00fcbeck Law]]. In 1276 the place was named Civitas, and in 1284 the Castrum Ukermunde, a fortress castle, was built by the Dukes of [[Pomerania]]. In the 13th century, Ueckerm\u00fcnde was a city within walls with two gates, to withstand the siege by troops of [[Brandenburg]].\n\nOn 5 September 1327 by the [[Treaty of Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian margrave agreed on a formal peace. The question of fiefdom was spared. [[Barnim III, Duke of Pomerania]] agreed to marry Mechthild (also Mathilda), daughter of [[Rudolf I, Duke of Bavaria]], yet the marriage never takes place.<ref name=Heitz181>Heitz, Gerhard; Rischer, Henning (1995). ''Geschichte in Daten; Mecklenburg-Vorpommern''. M\u00fcnster-Berlin: Koehler & Amelang. {{ISBN|3-7338-0195-4}}; p. 181</ref>\n\nIn the great fire of 1473 many of the medieval houses and the church were destroyed. In 1540 construction of the four wings of a castle was started by Pomeranian Duke [[Philipp I. (Pommern)|Philipp I]]. In 1753 construction of the [[Gothic art|late-Gothic]] City Church St. Marien was started.\n\nIn 1540 the building of the four wings of the castle was started by Pomeranian Duke [[Philipp I. (Pommern)|Philipp I]].\n\n===16th to 19th centuries===\nThe city underwent many sieges and was conquered numerous times during the following centuries. The city was almost completely destroyed in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; of 1600 inhabitants, only 15 survived. The city was then repeatedly held by opposing forces. In 1631 a great fire destroyed about 40 houses and the Town Hall. In 1639 there were only ten habitable houses in the city. In 1648 after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] the town became Swedish. Christina, [[Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]], decided to settle towns in the area with [[Finland|Fins]] and [[Livonia]]ns.\n\nIn the course of the [[Great Northern War]], after Russian and Saxon troops had occupied [[Szczecin]] and [[Pomerania]], Prussia made a  payment of over four hundred thousand [[thaler]]s for the provisional administration of the territory. With the Peace of Stockholm, on 21 January (or 1 February) 1720 a payment of two million crowns was made to purchase Western Pomerania with Stettin, Usedom and Wollin. Ueckerm\u00fcnde had thus become Prussian. That same year, the ruined castle's south wing and the rest of the keep was demolished.\n\nIn the early 18th century Ueckerm\u00fcnde was known for the royalty who liked to vacation there. The soldier king [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]], [[August III]], King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, King of Poland [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], and the Russian monarch [[Peter the Great]] also spent time in the city.\n\nThe Swedish army conquered the city in 1761 and set up command in the castle district. In 1766 the Gothic church was replaced by a new building. In 1806 Ueckerm\u00fcnde was occupied by French troops.\n\nOnly at the end of the 18th, and the beginning of the 19th century did the city begin to flourish. Like [[Torgelow]] where, after the discovery of bog iron, several iron foundries were built, Ueckerm\u00fcnde saw the construction of roughly 50 brickworks in the 19th century and the city developed into an important trading, and shipbuilding center. From 1781 to 1795, 102 ships were launched. In the 1818 Prussian administrative reform the county of Ueckerm\u00fcnde (832 square kilometers and 24,000 inhabitants) was created.\n\nBetween 1819 and 1994 Ueckerm\u00fcnde was the county seat. By the middle of the 19th century there were over 27 merchant ships owned by Ueckerm\u00fcnders.<ref name='Duncker-Humblot 1848-01-01'>{{cite book | last1 = Wendt | first1 = E. | title = Uebersicht der Preussischen Handels-Marine: Stettin. 1848 | publisher = Duncker & Humblot | date = 1 January 1848 | location = [[Berlin]] | pages = 27\u201328 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YskDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA38  | accessdate = 2011-05-23}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] in the second half of the 19th century, many new buildings that shape the old town including the market and St. Mary's Church were built. At the end of the 19th century, an advanced medical facility St. Christopher's Hospital, known today as Ameos Clinic, was constructed.\n\n===Recent history===\nAt the time of [[Nazi Germany|national socialism]], the ten to twelve remaining [[Judaism|Jewish families]] were driven into exile or murdered. An existing Jewish cemetery survived Nazi rule, but later fell into disrepair, and was desecrated. In 1961 a memorial was set up under state protection.\n\nIn 1945 the city surrendered without a fight or major war damage and was handed over to Soviet troops.\n\nIn the castle in 1950, the Haffmuseum was opened and has been enlarged several times. In 1962, the construction of 18 hectares the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Animal Park began housing bout 400 animals of nearly 120 species. It receives over 150,000 visitors each year. At the end of the 1960s a new development to house over 6,000 people was built in a new district in an area in the west of the city.\n\nThe largest operation during [[German Democratic Republic|East]] German period was a foundry with 1,100 employees in Ueckerm\u00fcnde. In 1997, the last of fifty brick factories in Ueckerm\u00fcnde was closed down.\n\nThe old town remained intact in GDR times but many buildings suffered major structural damage because of decades' of lack of maintenance. 1991 saw the redevelopment of the historic city center, beginning with a preserved southern wing of the palace. The Old Bulwark, an essential part of the old port, has been rehabilitated. The district Ueckerm\u00fcnde East (Garden City), was renovated as part of the basic urban renewal East. The area had been characterized by prefabricated buildings with a high housing vacancy, leading to partial restoration measures and restructuring processes.\n\nThe early 1990s also saw the restoration of many hotels, guest houses, apartments, and shops in the city center. A marina with 400 berths and 200 apartments was built in the vicinity of the Szczecin Lagoon.\n\nIn 2001 Ueckerm\u00fcnde received the title of \"state-approved resort\". For its exemplary city planning, Ueckerm\u00fcnde was given a national award in 2002 along with the cities of [[Eggesin]] and [[Torgelow]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe town, lying on the [[Oder Lagoon]] (''Oderhaff, Stettiner Haff'') is Germany's northeasternmost [[port]] city. It is recognized by the state as a resort town, and it is home to the last palace of the [[Dukes of Pomerania]] still in existence on German soil. The town's namesake, the River [[Uecker]], empties into the Lagoon; Ueckerm\u00fcnde means \"mouth of the Uecker\".\n\nThe surrounding area, even when seen from the odd spot that reaches 20&nbsp;m above [[sea level]], is almost flat. The city also gave the [[Ueckerm\u00fcnder Heide]] ([[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and [[woodland]]) its name. It is Western Pomerania's biggest wooded area, and stretches from the northwest to the southeast over 50&nbsp;km to the Polish town of [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] (P\u00f6litz in [[German language|German]]).\n\n==History of Oder Lagoon==\nIn 1889 a River Bathhouse opened on the Uecker. In 1924 the [[Lido (Ueckerm\u00fcnde)|lido]] opened in Ueckerm\u00fcnde, and in 1927 the Beach Hall opened at the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Oder Lagoon. In 1935 the Urban Spa and Tourist Association were founded. From this period, the first postcards of Ueckerm\u00fcnde reading \"Haffbad Ueckerm\u00fcnde, the cheap resort for guests looking for relaxation\" appeared. After the war, large parts of the beach had very rough trenches, and the pier, used for mooring passenger ships and seaplanes, was destroyed.\n\nIn the 1950s, there was a [[Steamboat|steamboat pier]] at the head Uecker (1959); the beach park was designed and the beach hall was rebuilt again. In the 1960s the city was built around a ten-kilometer-long belt declared a conservation area. In 1969 the municipal association for recreation ''Haffk\u00fcste Ueckerm\u00fcnde'' responsible for the city Ueckerm\u00fcnde was formed. In the following year the  Hafftourist, an economic project of the local communities Ueckerm\u00fcnde, [[M\u00f6nkebude]], [[Grambin]] and [[Vogelsang, Brandenburg|Vogelsang]], was created to promote joint tourism ventures. After the reunification the whole beach was reorganized and expanded and made accessible.\n\n===History of the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Sanatorium===\nUeckerm\u00fcnde has had a large psychiatric hospital for many years. The hospital, now called the Christopher's Hospital, was, in the late 19th and beginning of the 20th century, highly progressive, employing innovative treatments and therapies. Patients with mental as well as physical disabilities were not only treated, but as far as possible employed and promoted.\n\nWith the takeover by the Nazis, the political environment for dealing with the mentally ill and disabled changed. The Ueckerm\u00fcnder hospital gained notoriety in the wake of the so-called [[Action T4]], with the large-scale murders of tens of thousands of helpless patients, many of them deemed \"unworthy\" children. Ueckerm\u00fcnde was obviously an important center of this action in Pomerania. Murders took place in medical institutions in Western Pomerania and partly in converted SS-barracks. The murders of hundreds were covered up and their deaths entered as \"normal\" disease-related deaths in hospital records.\n\n===Parts of town===\nThe following communities belong to Ueckerm\u00fcnde:\n* Bellin\n* Berndshof\n* Rosenm\u00fchl\n* Neuhof\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nClockwise from the east are: Vogelsang-Warsin, Eggesin, Liepgarten, L\u00fcbs, M\u00f6nkebude and Grambin.\n\n==Local council==\nAfter the elections from May 2014, the local council has 21 members.<ref>[http://www.sitzungsdienst-ueckermuende.de/bi/pa021.asp Stadt Ueckerm\u00fcnde: Stadtvertretung]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n! width=90 align=left | Party / List || width=\"90\"| [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || width=90 | [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] || width=90 | [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || width=90 | Voters association|We from here\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=left | '''seats''' || 8 || 6 || 4 || 3\n|}\nThe [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]] did not run for the local elections in 2014.

The name Ucramund appears in documents from 1178. Since May 1, 2013 Ueckerm\u00fcnde has been an officially recognized [[seaside resort]].<ref>[http://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/doberan/index_artikel_komplett.phtml?param=news&id=3760361 Haff-Stadt Ueckerm\u00fcnde ist jetzt offiziell ein Seebad] (Ostsee-Zeitung Online, May 1, 2013)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{wide image|Panorama Altstadt.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|Old Town}}\n[[File:Uede schlossturm.jpg|thumb|Castle tower]]\n[[File:Panorama Marktplatz.jpg|thumb|Historical market square of Ueckerm\u00fcnde]]\n[[File:Uede berggasse.jpg|thumb|Berggasse]]\n[[File:Lubinus Ueckermuende.png|thumb|View on the map at the beginning of the 17th Lubinschen map]]\n[[File:Ackerhof.jpg|thumb|Ackerhof]]\n[[File:Ueckerm\u00fcnde im 17.

The Uecker River flows from [[Brandenburg]], where it is called Ucker, into the [[Oder Lagoon]]. The river's name corresponds to the name of the adjacent region ([[Uckermark]]) and the name of the medieval [[Wends|Wendish]] tribe of the [[Ukrani|Ukr(an)i]] who inhabited the area prior to the German [[Ostsiedlung]] or eastern expansion. The first known reference to Ucramund is in an 1178 document. Later spellings included Ukeremund, Ukeremunde and Ukermunde (1284).\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the old Slavonic era Ueckerm\u00fcnde's location made it a settlement of fishermen. In 1178 (according to other sources 1223) Ucramund was first mentioned and in 1243 the [[Usedom Abbey|Monastery Grobe]] was built in Usedom. In 1260 [[Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania|Barnim I, the duke of Pomerania]], founded a monastery and the original trade center was awarded a town charter under [[L\u00fcbeck Law]]. In 1276 the place was named Civitas, and in 1284 the Castrum Ukermunde, a fortress castle, was built by the Dukes of [[Pomerania]]. In the 13th century, Ueckerm\u00fcnde was a city within walls with two gates, to withstand the siege by troops of [[Brandenburg]].\n\nOn 5 September 1327 by the [[Treaty of Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian margrave agreed on a formal peace. The question of fiefdom was spared. [[Barnim III, Duke of Pomerania]] agreed to marry Mechthild (also Mathilda), daughter of [[Rudolf I, Duke of Bavaria]], yet the marriage never takes place.<ref name=Heitz181>Heitz, Gerhard; Rischer, Henning (1995). ''Geschichte in Daten; Mecklenburg-Vorpommern''. M\u00fcnster-Berlin: Koehler & Amelang. {{ISBN|3-7338-0195-4}}; p. 181</ref>\n\nIn the great fire of 1473 many of the medieval houses and the church were destroyed. In 1540 construction of the four wings of a castle was started by Pomeranian Duke [[Philipp I. (Pommern)|Philipp I]]. In 1753 construction of the [[Gothic art|late-Gothic]] City Church St. Marien was started.\n\nIn 1540 the building of the four wings of the castle was started by Pomeranian Duke [[Philipp I. (Pommern)|Philipp I]].\n\n===16th to 19th centuries===\nThe city underwent many sieges and was conquered numerous times during the following centuries. The city was almost completely destroyed in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; of 1600 inhabitants, only 15 survived. The city was then repeatedly held by opposing forces. In 1631 a great fire destroyed about 40 houses and the Town Hall. In 1639 there were only ten habitable houses in the city. In 1648 after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] the town became Swedish. Christina, [[Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]], decided to settle towns in the area with [[Finland|Fins]] and [[Livonia]]ns.\n\nIn the course of the [[Great Northern War]], after Russian and Saxon troops had occupied [[Szczecin]] and [[Pomerania]], Prussia made a  payment of over four hundred thousand [[thaler]]s for the provisional administration of the territory. With the Peace of Stockholm, on 21 January (or 1 February) 1720 a payment of two million crowns was made to purchase Western Pomerania with Stettin, Usedom and Wollin. Ueckerm\u00fcnde had thus become Prussian. That same year, the ruined castle's south wing and the rest of the keep was demolished.\n\nIn the early 18th century Ueckerm\u00fcnde was known for the royalty who liked to vacation there. The soldier king [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]], [[August III]], King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, King of Poland [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], and the Russian monarch [[Peter the Great]] also spent time in the city.\n\nThe Swedish army conquered the city in 1761 and set up command in the castle district. In 1766 the Gothic church was replaced by a new building. In 1806 Ueckerm\u00fcnde was occupied by French troops.\n\nOnly at the end of the 18th, and the beginning of the 19th century did the city begin to flourish. Like [[Torgelow]] where, after the discovery of bog iron, several iron foundries were built, Ueckerm\u00fcnde saw the construction of roughly 50 brickworks in the 19th century and the city developed into an important trading, and shipbuilding center. From 1781 to 1795, 102 ships were launched. In the 1818 Prussian administrative reform the county of Ueckerm\u00fcnde (832 square kilometers and 24,000 inhabitants) was created.\n\nBetween 1819 and 1994 Ueckerm\u00fcnde was the county seat. By the middle of the 19th century there were over 27 merchant ships owned by Ueckerm\u00fcnders.<ref name='Duncker-Humblot 1848-01-01'>{{cite book | last1 = Wendt | first1 = E. | title = Uebersicht der Preussischen Handels-Marine: Stettin. 1848 | publisher = Duncker & Humblot | date = 1 January 1848 | location = [[Berlin]] | pages = 27\u201328 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YskDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA38  | accessdate = 2011-05-23}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] in the second half of the 19th century, many new buildings that shape the old town including the market and St. Mary's Church were built. At the end of the 19th century, an advanced medical facility St. Christopher's Hospital, known today as Ameos Clinic, was constructed.\n\n===Recent history===\nAt the time of [[Nazi Germany|national socialism]], the ten to twelve remaining [[Judaism|Jewish families]] were driven into exile or murdered. An existing Jewish cemetery survived Nazi rule, but later fell into disrepair, and was desecrated. In 1961 a memorial was set up under state protection.\n\nIn 1945 the city surrendered without a fight or major war damage and was handed over to Soviet troops.\n\nIn the castle in 1950, the Haffmuseum was opened and has been enlarged several times. In 1962, the construction of 18 hectares the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Animal Park began housing bout 400 animals of nearly 120 species. It receives over 150,000 visitors each year. At the end of the 1960s a new development to house over 6,000 people was built in a new district in an area in the west of the city.\n\nThe largest operation during [[German Democratic Republic|East]] German period was a foundry with 1,100 employees in Ueckerm\u00fcnde. In 1997, the last of fifty brick factories in Ueckerm\u00fcnde was closed down.\n\nThe old town remained intact in GDR times but many buildings suffered major structural damage because of decades' of lack of maintenance. 1991 saw the redevelopment of the historic city center, beginning with a preserved southern wing of the palace. The Old Bulwark, an essential part of the old port, has been rehabilitated. The district Ueckerm\u00fcnde East (Garden City), was renovated as part of the basic urban renewal East. The area had been characterized by prefabricated buildings with a high housing vacancy, leading to partial restoration measures and restructuring processes.\n\nThe early 1990s also saw the restoration of many hotels, guest houses, apartments, and shops in the city center. A marina with 400 berths and 200 apartments was built in the vicinity of the Szczecin Lagoon.\n\nIn 2001 Ueckerm\u00fcnde received the title of \"state-approved resort\". For its exemplary city planning, Ueckerm\u00fcnde was given a national award in 2002 along with the cities of [[Eggesin]] and [[Torgelow]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe town, lying on the [[Oder Lagoon]] (''Oderhaff, Stettiner Haff'') is Germany's northeasternmost [[port]] city. It is recognized by the state as a resort town, and it is home to the last palace of the [[Dukes of Pomerania]] still in existence on German soil. The town's namesake, the River [[Uecker]], empties into the Lagoon; Ueckerm\u00fcnde means \"mouth of the Uecker\".\n\nThe surrounding area, even when seen from the odd spot that reaches 20&nbsp;m above [[sea level]], is almost flat. The city also gave the [[Ueckerm\u00fcnder Heide]] ([[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and [[woodland]]) its name. It is Western Pomerania's biggest wooded area, and stretches from the northwest to the southeast over 50&nbsp;km to the Polish town of [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] (P\u00f6litz in [[German language|German]]).\n\n==History of Oder Lagoon==\nIn 1889 a River Bathhouse opened on the Uecker. In 1924 the [[Lido (Ueckerm\u00fcnde)|lido]] opened in Ueckerm\u00fcnde, and in 1927 the Beach Hall opened at the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Oder Lagoon. In 1935 the Urban Spa and Tourist Association were founded. From this period, the first postcards of Ueckerm\u00fcnde reading \"Haffbad Ueckerm\u00fcnde, the cheap resort for guests looking for relaxation\" appeared. After the war, large parts of the beach had very rough trenches, and the pier, used for mooring passenger ships and seaplanes, was destroyed.\n\nIn the 1950s, there was a [[Steamboat|steamboat pier]] at the head Uecker (1959); the beach park was designed and the beach hall was rebuilt again. In the 1960s the city was built around a ten-kilometer-long belt declared a conservation area. In 1969 the municipal association for recreation ''Haffk\u00fcste Ueckerm\u00fcnde'' responsible for the city Ueckerm\u00fcnde was formed. In the following year the  Hafftourist, an economic project of the local communities Ueckerm\u00fcnde, [[M\u00f6nkebude]], [[Grambin]] and [[Vogelsang, Brandenburg|Vogelsang]], was created to promote joint tourism ventures. After the reunification the whole beach was reorganized and expanded and made accessible.\n\n===History of the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Sanatorium===\nUeckerm\u00fcnde has had a large psychiatric hospital for many years. The hospital, now called the Christopher's Hospital, was, in the late 19th and beginning of the 20th century, highly progressive, employing innovative treatments and therapies. Patients with mental as well as physical disabilities were not only treated, but as far as possible employed and promoted.\n\nWith the takeover by the Nazis, the political environment for dealing with the mentally ill and disabled changed. The Ueckerm\u00fcnder hospital gained notoriety in the wake of the so-called [[Action T4]], with the large-scale murders of tens of thousands of helpless patients, many of them deemed \"unworthy\" children. Ueckerm\u00fcnde was obviously an important center of this action in Pomerania. Murders took place in medical institutions in Western Pomerania and partly in converted SS-barracks. The murders of hundreds were covered up and their deaths entered as \"normal\" disease-related deaths in hospital records.\n\n===Parts of town===\nThe following communities belong to Ueckerm\u00fcnde:\n* Bellin\n* Berndshof\n* Rosenm\u00fchl\n* Neuhof\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nClockwise from the east are: Vogelsang-Warsin, Eggesin, Liepgarten, L\u00fcbs, M\u00f6nkebude and Grambin.\n\n==Local council==\nAfter the elections from May 2014, the local council has 21 members.<ref>[http://www.sitzungsdienst-ueckermuende.de/bi/pa021.asp Stadt Ueckerm\u00fcnde: Stadtvertretung]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n! width=90 align=left | Party / List || width=\"90\"| [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || width=90 | [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] || width=90 | [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || width=90 | Voters association|We from here\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=left | '''seats''' || 8 || 6 || 4 || 3\n|}\nThe [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]] did not run for the local elections in 2014.
