In [[Federalist No. 46]], Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms,\" and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".<ref name=\"emerson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/emerson.html|title=United States of America v.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u2013106. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng.

Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question.

The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and it will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.

A right to the privileges and immunities of citizens in any of the several States. Among these is the fundamental and elementary right of suffrage.

A right to just compensation for private property legally taken for public use. 8. A right to participate in all rights retained by, or reserved to, the people.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"<ref name=\"District of Columbia v Heller\"/>}}\n\nIn a dissent, joined by justices [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], Justice Stevens said:\n\n{{quote |The Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the \"right to keep and bear arms\" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia.

Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;. It was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u2013106. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:<ref>Vile, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt et al., p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\n* interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;\n* sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to suppress insurrection;\n* a national militia to repel foreign invaders.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.<ref name=\"isbn0-300-09562-7\">Williams, pp.&nbsp;41\u201344.</ref> [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article 1, Section 8]] of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:<ref>{{cite web |last=Story |first=Joseph |title=Commentaries on the Constitution |at=2:\u00a7\u00a7 904\u201425, 927\u201430, 946\u201452, 954\u201470, 972\u201476, 988 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |work=The Founders Constitution |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235955/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n* provide and maintain a navy;\n* make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n* provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n* provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

A right to the privileges and immunities of citizens in any of the several States. Among these is the fundamental and elementary right of suffrage. The Representatives to the national and State legislatures must be chosen by the people, the citizens (Section 2). Consequently, the citizens must choose them, and have a right to choose them.

A right to trial by jury in any criminal case. 5. A right to keep and bear arms. 6. A right to life, liberty, and property, unless deprived by due process of law. 7. A right to just compensation for private property legally taken for public use. 8. A right to participate in all rights retained by, or reserved to, the people.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"<ref name=\"District of Columbia v Heller\"/>}}\n\nIn a dissent, joined by justices [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], Justice Stevens said:\n\n{{quote |The Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the \"right to keep and bear arms\" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule.

Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''.

The court noted that it had, prior to ''Heller'', identified the Second Amendment as providing an individual right to bear arms, and had already, likewise, determined that restrictions on felon ownership of firearms did not violate this right.

{"title_page": "The Cenci", "text_new": "{{short description|1819 play by Percy Bysshe Shelley}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:TheCenci.gif|thumb|1819 title page, Livorno first edition, C. and J. Ollier, London.]]\n{{italic title}}\n'''''The Cenci, A Tragedy, in Five Acts''''' (1819) is a [[Poetry|verse]] drama in five acts by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] written in the summer of 1819, and inspired by a real Italian family, the House of Cenci (in particular, [[Beatrice Cenci]], pronounced CHEN-chee). Shelley composed the play in [[Rome]] and at Villa Valsovano near [[Livorno]], from May to August 5, 1819. The work was published by [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] in London in 1819. The Livorno edition was printed in Livorno, Italy by Shelley himself in a run of 250 copies. Shelley told [[Thomas Love Peacock]] that he arranged for the printing himself because in Italy \"it costs, with all duties and freightage, about half of what it would cost in London.\" Shelley sought to have the play staged, describing it as \"totally different from anything you might conjecture that I should write; of a more popular kind... written for the multitude.\" Shelley wrote to his publisher Charles Ollier that he was confident that the play \"will succeed as a publication.\" A second edition appeared in 1821, his only published work to go into a second edition during his lifetime.\n\nThe play was not considered stageable in its day due to its themes of [[incest]] and [[parricide]], and was not performed in public in England until 1922, when it was staged in London. In 1886 the Shelley Society had sponsored a private production at the Grand Theatre, [[Islington]], before an audience that included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Browning]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Oscar Wilde's review of the performance in ''Dramatic Review'' (May 15, 1886) in [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14240/14240-h/14240-h.htm \"Reviews\"].</ref><ref>Armstrong, James. \"Premieres Unpleasant: How the Infamous Debut of Shelley's ''The Cenci'' Helped Make Shaw a Playwright.\" ''Shaw'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (2017), pp. 282-299.</ref> Though there has been much debate over the play's stageability, it has been produced in many countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.<ref>Cameron, Kenneth N., and Horst Frenz.

''Percy Bysshe Shelley: A Biography: Exile of Unfulfilled Renown, 1816\u20131822''. Rosemont, 2005.</ref> It was included in the [[Harvard Classics]] as one of the most important and representative works of the [[Western canon]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe horrific tragedy, set in 1599 in Rome, of a young woman executed for pre-meditated murder of her tyrannical father, was a well-known true story handed down orally and documented in the ''Annali d'Italia'', a twelve-volume chronicle of Italian history written by [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]] in 1749. The events occurred during the [[Pontificate]] of [[Pope Clement VIII]].\n\nShelley was first drawn to dramatize the tale after viewing [[Guido Reni]]'s portrait of Beatrice Cenci, a painting that intrigued Shelley's poetic imagination.\n\n'''Act I'''\n\nThe play opens with Cardinal Camillo discussing with Count [[Francesco Cenci]] a murder in which Cenci is implicated. Camillo tells Cenci that the matter will be hushed up if Cenci will relinquish a third of his possessions, his property beyond the Pincian gate, to the Church. Count Cenci has sent two of his sons, Rocco and Cristofano, to Salamanca, Spain in the expectation that they will die of starvation. The Count's virtuous daughter, Beatrice, and Orsino, a prelate in love with Beatrice, discuss petitioning the Pope to relieve the Cenci family from the Count's brutal rule. Orsino withholds the petition, however, revealing himself to be disingenuous, lustful for Beatrice, and greedy. After he hears the news that his sons have been brutally killed in Salamanca, the Count holds a feast in celebration of their deaths, commanding his guests to revel with him. Cenci drinks wine which he imagines as \"my children's blood\" which he \"did thirst to drink!\" During the feast, Beatrice pleads with the guests to protect her family from her sadistic father, but the guests refuse, in fear of Cenci's brutality and retribution.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nCount Cenci torments Beatrice and her stepmother, Lucretia, and announces his plan to imprison them in his castle in Petrella. A servant returns Beatrice's petition to the Pope, unopened, and Beatrice and Lucretia despair over the last hope of salvation from the Count. Orsino encourages Cenci's son, Giacomo, upset over Cenci's appropriation of Giacomo's wife's dowry, to murder Cenci.\n\n'''Act III'''\n\nBeatrice reveals to Lucretia that the Count has committed an unnameable act against her and expresses feelings of spiritual and physical contamination, implying Cenci's incestuous rape of his daughter. Orsino and Lucretia agree with Beatrice's suggestion that the Count must be murdered. After the first attempt at patricide fails because Cenci arrives early, Orsino conspires with Beatrice, Lucretia, and Giacomo, in a second assassination plot. Orsino proposes that two of Cenci's ill-treated servants, Marzio and Olimpio, carry out the murder.\n\n'''Act IV'''\n\nThe scene shifts to the Petrella Castle in the Apulian Apennines. Olimpio and Marzio enter Cenci's bedchamber to murder him, but hesitate to kill the sleeping Count and return to the conspirators with the deed undone. Threatening to kill Cenci herself, Beatrice shames the servants into action, and Olimpio and Marzio strangle the Count and throw his body out of the room off the balcony, where it is entangled in a pine. Shortly thereafter, Savella, a papal legate, arrives with a murder charge and execution order against Cenci. Upon finding the Count's dead body, the legate arrests the conspirators, with the exception of Orsino, who escapes in disguise.\n\n'''Act V'''\n\nThe suspects are taken for trial for murder in Rome. Marzio is tortured and confesses to the murder, implicating Cenci's family members. Despite learning that Lucretia and Giacomo have also confessed, Beatrice refuses to do so, steadfastly insisting on her innocence. At the trial, all of the conspirators are found guilty and sentenced to death. Bernardo, another of Cenci's sons, attempts a futile last-minute appeal to the Pope to have mercy on his family. The Pope is reported to have declared: \"They must die.\" The play concludes with Beatrice walking stoically to her execution for murder. Her final words are: \"We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.\"\n\n==Major characters==\n\n* Count Francesco Cenci, head of the Cenci household and family\n* Beatrice, his daughter\n* Lucretia, the wife of Francesco Cenci and the stepmother of his children\n* Cardinal Camillo\n* Orsino, a Prelate\n* Savella, the Pope's Legate\n* Andrea, a servant to Francesco Cenci\n* Marzio, an assassin\n* Olimpio, an assassin\n* Giacomo, son of Francesco Cenci\n* Bernardo, son of Francesco Cenci\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his May 15, 1886 review of the play, [[Oscar Wilde]] concluded: \"In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.\" Alfred and [[H. Buxton Forman]] also praised ''The Cenci'' as a \"tragic masterpiece\", elevating Shelley into the company of [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. [[Leigh Hunt]], to whom the play was dedicated, effused over Shelley's \"great sweetness of nature, and enthusiasm for good\". [[Mary Shelley]], in her note on the play, wrote that \"[u]niversal approbation soon stamped ''The Cenci'' as the best tragedy of modern times.\" She critically assessed Act V: \"The Fifth Act is a masterpiece. It is the finest thing he ever wrote, and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary, but preceding, poet.\" She noted that \"Shelley wished ''The Cenci'' to be acted\", intending the work, which she wrote was of \"surpassing excellence\", to be an acting play, not a \"closet drama\". Shelley sought unsuccessfully to have the play staged at Covent Garden.\n\n[[Lord Byron|Byron]] wrote his criticisms of the play in a letter to Shelley: \"I read ''Cenci'' \u2013 but, besides that I think the subject essentially un-dramatic, I am not a great admirer of our old dramatists as models. I deny that the English have hitherto had a drama at all. Your ''Cenci'', however, was a work of power and poetry.\" Byron told [[Thomas Medwin]] in conversation: \"The ''Cenci'' is... perhaps the best tragedy modern times have produced.\" [[William Wordsworth]] reportedly called the play \"the greatest tragedy of the age.\"<ref>Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137.</ref> After seeing a performance of the play in 1886, George Bernard Shaw commented that \"Shelley and Shakespeare are the only dramatists who have dealt in despair of this quality.\"<ref>Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137.</ref> \n\nA reviewer writing for the ''[[Literary Gazette]]'' in 1820, on the other hand, wrote that the play was \"noxious\", \"odious\", and \"abominable\". The taboo subjects of incest, patricide, and parricide, as well as the negative depiction of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], however, prevented ''The Cenci'' from being staged publicly. The first public performance in England was in 1922.\n\n==Antonin Artaud adaptation==\n[[Antonin Artaud]] staged his adaptation ''Les Censi'' in 1935 in [[Theatre of Cruelty]] form. His extensive use of [[surrealism]] in the performance meant that the production was shown only 17 times before closing. Artaud used highly graphic and disturbing images that were meant to release the audience from their current state of mind, especially during the murder scene, where the main character, Count Cenci (the role that was played by Artaud), is murdered by his two servants. These images were supposed to release what Artaud called the \"savage under the skin\", an aim that was used by Artaud in many of his productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/theatre-of-cruelty-artaud.html|title=Theatre of Cruelty: Artaud|last1=Carroll|first1=Heather|date=|website=Study.com|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Opera adaptations==\n\nGerman composer [[Berthold Goldschmidt]] composed an opera in three acts based on the Shelley play in 1949 entitled ''Beatrice Cenci'' with a libretto by [[Martin Esslin]] \"after Shelley's verse drama ''The Cenci''\". The opera won first prize in the [[Festival of Britain]] opera competition in 1951. The opera was first performed in 1988. The first staged production of ''Beatrice Cenci'' in the UK was by the [[Trinity College of Music]] on July 9\u201311, 1998.\n\nIn 1951, British classical composer [[Havergal Brian]] composed an opera based on the Shelley play entitled ''The Cenci'', an opera in eight scenes. The opera premiered in 1997 in the UK in a performance in London by the Millennium Sinfonia conducted by James Kelleher..\n\nIn 1971, ''[[Beatrix Cenci]]'' premiered, an opera in two acts by [[Alberto Ginastera]] to a Spanish libretto by the playwright [[William Shand]].\n==Other works titled ''The Cenci''==\nOther works titled ''The Cenci'' include an 1837 novella by Marie-Henri Beyle ([[Stendhal]]), and an 1840 [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] essay by [[Alexandre Dumas|Alexandre Dumas ''p\u00e8re'']] included in Volume 1 of ''Celebrated Crimes''.\n\n==Productions of Shelley's ''The Cenci''==\n* (1886) Grand Theatre, Islington, London, UK (private production)\n* (1891) Paris, France\n* (1919) Moscow, Russia\n* (1920) Moscow, Russia\n* (1922) Prague, Czechoslovakia\n* (1922) New Theatre, London, UK\n* (1926) London, UK\n* (1933) Armenian Cultural Society of Los Angeles, California (in Armenian)\n* (1935) [[People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]], Newcastle, UK\n* (1936) [[Yale University]]\n* (1940) Bellingham, Washington\n* (1947) [[Equity Library Theatre]], New York\n* (1947) [[BBC Radio|BBC radio]] production\n* (1948) BBC radio production\n* (1948) [[Princeton University]]\n* (1949) [[Mt.

Ollier, London.]]\n{{italic title}}\n'''''The Cenci, A Tragedy, in Five Acts''''' (1819) is a [[Poetry|verse]] drama in five acts by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] written in the summer of 1819, and inspired by a real Italian family, the House of Cenci (in particular, [[Beatrice Cenci]], pronounced CHEN-chee). Shelley composed the play in [[Rome]] and at Villa Valsovano near [[Livorno]], from May to August 5, 1819. The work was published by [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] in London in 1819. The Livorno edition was printed in Livorno, Italy by Shelley himself in a run of 250 copies. Shelley told [[Thomas Love Peacock]] that he arranged for the printing himself because in Italy \"it costs, with all duties and freightage, about half of what it would cost in London.\" Shelley sought to have the play staged, describing it as \"totally different from anything you might conjecture that I should write; of a more popular kind... written for the multitude.\" Shelley wrote to his publisher Charles Ollier that he was confident that the play \"will succeed as a publication.\" A second edition appeared in 1821, his only published work to go into a second edition during his lifetime.\n\nThe play was not considered stageable in its day due to its themes of [[incest]] and [[parricide]], and was not performed in public in England until 1922, when it was staged in London. In 1886 the Shelley Society had sponsored a private production at the Grand Theatre, [[Islington]], before an audience that included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Browning]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Oscar Wilde's review of the performance in ''Dramatic Review'' (May 15, 1886) in [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14240/14240-h/14240-h.htm \"Reviews\"].</ref><ref>Armstrong, James. \"Premieres Unpleasant: How the Infamous Debut of Shelley's ''The Cenci'' Helped Make Shaw a Playwright.\" ''Shaw'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (2017), pp. 282-299.</ref> Though there has been much debate over the play's stageability, it has been produced in many countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.<ref>Cameron, Kenneth N., and Horst Frenz.

The events occurred during the [[Pontificate]] of [[Pope Clement VIII]].\n\nShelley was first drawn to dramatize the tale after viewing [[Guido Reni]]'s portrait of Beatrice Cenci, a painting that intrigued Shelley's poetic imagination.\n\n'''Act I'''\n\nThe play opens with Cardinal Camillo discussing with Count [[Francesco Cenci]] a murder in which Cenci is implicated. Camillo tells Cenci that the matter will be hushed up if Cenci will relinquish a third of his possessions, his property beyond the Pincian gate, to the Church. Count Cenci has sent two of his sons, Rocco and Cristofano, to Salamanca, Spain in the expectation that they will die of starvation. The Count's virtuous daughter, Beatrice, and Orsino, a prelate in love with Beatrice, discuss petitioning the Pope to relieve the Cenci family from the Count's brutal rule. Orsino withholds the petition, however, revealing himself to be disingenuous, lustful for Beatrice, and greedy. After he hears the news that his sons have been brutally killed in Salamanca, the Count holds a feast in celebration of their deaths, commanding his guests to revel with him. Cenci drinks wine which he imagines as \"my children's blood\" which he \"did thirst to drink!\" During the feast, Beatrice pleads with the guests to protect her family from her sadistic father, but the guests refuse, in fear of Cenci's brutality and retribution.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nCount Cenci torments Beatrice and her stepmother, Lucretia, and announces his plan to imprison them in his castle in Petrella. A servant returns Beatrice's petition to the Pope, unopened, and Beatrice and Lucretia despair over the last hope of salvation from the Count. Orsino encourages Cenci's son, Giacomo, upset over Cenci's appropriation of Giacomo's wife's dowry, to murder Cenci.\n\n'''Act III'''\n\nBeatrice reveals to Lucretia that the Count has committed an unnameable act against her and expresses feelings of spiritual and physical contamination, implying Cenci's incestuous rape of his daughter. Orsino and Lucretia agree with Beatrice's suggestion that the Count must be murdered. After the first attempt at patricide fails because Cenci arrives early, Orsino conspires with Beatrice, Lucretia, and Giacomo, in a second assassination plot. Orsino proposes that two of Cenci's ill-treated servants, Marzio and Olimpio, carry out the murder.\n\n'''Act IV'''\n\nThe scene shifts to the Petrella Castle in the Apulian Apennines. Olimpio and Marzio enter Cenci's bedchamber to murder him, but hesitate to kill the sleeping Count and return to the conspirators with the deed undone. Threatening to kill Cenci herself, Beatrice shames the servants into action, and Olimpio and Marzio strangle the Count and throw his body out of the room off the balcony, where it is entangled in a pine. Shortly thereafter, Savella, a papal legate, arrives with a murder charge and execution order against Cenci. Upon finding the Count's dead body, the legate arrests the conspirators, with the exception of Orsino, who escapes in disguise.\n\n'''Act V'''\n\nThe suspects are taken for trial for murder in Rome. Marzio is tortured and confesses to the murder, implicating Cenci's family members. Despite learning that Lucretia and Giacomo have also confessed, Beatrice refuses to do so, steadfastly insisting on her innocence. At the trial, all of the conspirators are found guilty and sentenced to death. Bernardo, another of Cenci's sons, attempts a futile last-minute appeal to the Pope to have mercy on his family. The Pope is reported to have declared: \"They must die.\" The play concludes with Beatrice walking stoically to her execution for murder. Her final words are: \"We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.\"\n\n==Major characters==\n\n* Count Francesco Cenci, head of the Cenci household and family\n* Beatrice, his daughter\n* Lucretia, the wife of Francesco Cenci and the stepmother of his children\n* Cardinal Camillo\n* Orsino, a Prelate\n* Savella, the Pope's Legate\n* Andrea, a servant to Francesco Cenci\n* Marzio, an assassin\n* Olimpio, an assassin\n* Giacomo, son of Francesco Cenci\n* Bernardo, son of Francesco Cenci\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his May 15, 1886 review of the play, [[Oscar Wilde]] concluded: \"In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.\" Alfred and [[H. Buxton Forman]] also praised ''The Cenci'' as a \"tragic masterpiece\", elevating Shelley into the company of [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. [[Leigh Hunt]], to whom the play was dedicated, effused over Shelley's \"great sweetness of nature, and enthusiasm for good\". [[Mary Shelley]], in her note on the play, wrote that \"[u]niversal approbation soon stamped ''The Cenci'' as the best tragedy of modern times.\" She critically assessed Act V: \"The Fifth Act is a masterpiece. It is the finest thing he ever wrote, and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary, but preceding, poet.\" She noted that \"Shelley wished ''The Cenci'' to be acted\", intending the work, which she wrote was of \"surpassing excellence\", to be an acting play, not a \"closet drama\". Shelley sought unsuccessfully to have the play staged at Covent Garden.\n\n[[Lord Byron|Byron]] wrote his criticisms of the play in a letter to Shelley: \"I read ''Cenci'' \u2013 but, besides that I think the subject essentially un-dramatic, I am not a great admirer of our old dramatists as models. I deny that the English have hitherto had a drama at all. Your ''Cenci'', however, was a work of power and poetry.\" Byron told [[Thomas Medwin]] in conversation: \"The ''Cenci'' is... perhaps the best tragedy modern times have produced.\" [[William Wordsworth]] reportedly called the play \"the greatest tragedy of the age.\"<ref>Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137.</ref> After seeing a performance of the play in 1886, George Bernard Shaw commented that \"Shelley and Shakespeare are the only dramatists who have dealt in despair of this quality.\"<ref>Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137.</ref> \n\nA reviewer writing for the ''[[Literary Gazette]]'' in 1820, on the other hand, wrote that the play was \"noxious\", \"odious\", and \"abominable\". The taboo subjects of incest, patricide, and parricide, as well as the negative depiction of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], however, prevented ''The Cenci'' from being staged publicly. The first public performance in England was in 1922.\n\n==Antonin Artaud adaptation==\n[[Antonin Artaud]] staged his adaptation ''Les Censi'' in 1935 in [[Theatre of Cruelty]] form. His extensive use of [[surrealism]] in the performance meant that the production was shown only 17 times before closing. Artaud used highly graphic and disturbing images that were meant to release the audience from their current state of mind, especially during the murder scene, where the main character, Count Cenci (the role that was played by Artaud), is murdered by his two servants. These images were supposed to release what Artaud called the \"savage under the skin\", an aim that was used by Artaud in many of his productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/theatre-of-cruelty-artaud.html|title=Theatre of Cruelty: Artaud|last1=Carroll|first1=Heather|date=|website=Study.com|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Opera adaptations==\n\nGerman composer [[Berthold Goldschmidt]] composed an opera in three acts based on the Shelley play in 1949 entitled ''Beatrice Cenci'' with a libretto by [[Martin Esslin]] \"after Shelley's verse drama ''The Cenci''\".
