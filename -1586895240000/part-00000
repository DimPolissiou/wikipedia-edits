November 28, 2009.</ref> In a December 6, 2009 report from the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]], Freeston provided evidence that the election was more theatre than democratic practice. In particular, he exposed that the Honduran Supreme Electoral Tribunal's own internal figures on voter turnout were not 65% as election winner Pepe Lobo and Western media reported, but actually 49%. His conclusion was that no one could know for sure how many Hondurans voted, given that the election was run by the same military that overthrew the elected president five months earlier, and that all international election monitoring groups (including the [[UN]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Carter Center]], and [[European Union|EU]]) refused to observe the election.<ref name=\"therealnews.com\" /> On December 22, 2009, Freeston was featured on Honduras' [[Radio Globo (Honduras)|Radio Globo]] alongside ousted Honduran President [[Manuel Zelaya]] and American University Anthropologist Adrienne Pine, where he spoke about electoral fraud.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ManuelZelayaAdriennePineYJesseFreestonEnRadioGlobo22DeDiciembre \"Manuel Zelaya, Adrienne Pine, y Jesse Freeston en Radio Globo (22 de diciembre 2009)\"].

In a November 15, 2009 story for The Real News, Freeston interviewed [[Tom Shrake]], the CEO and President of Pacific Rim about the lawsuit. Shrake claimed Pacific Rim followed El Salvador's mining, investment, and environmental laws and was therefore denied a mining permit illegally. Freeston's investigation from San Isidro revealed contamination of the country's little-accessible water during the exploration stage, the inflammation of conflict by company promoters, the perception that the 2% tax Pacific Rim would pay on its revenues, and other social and environmental concerns were behind the resistance to the proposed mining project.<ref>Freeston, Jesse.

He called into question the meaning of having [[Freedom of the Press]] listed as a fundamental freedom in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], saying that \"no crisis, real or perceived, gives authorities the right to revoke it.

Hundert is a Kitchener-based activist who was arrested in a house raid before the G-20 began and charged, alongside 17 other activists, with conspiracy. After being released on bail, Hundert was re-arrested and jailed for participating as an invited speaker on a university panel at Ryerson University in Toronto. The government argued that his participation on a panel broke his bail condition barring him from participating in public protests. The courts agreed and adjusted Hundert's bail conditions to ban all political speech, including to the media. In an apparent challenge to the ban, Freeston published a 10-minute video that included a lengthy interview with Hundert, which according to Freeston was filmed before the ban was put into place.<ref>Freeston, Jesse.

Freeston's investigation from San Isidro revealed contamination of the country's little-accessible water during the exploration stage, the inflammation of conflict by company promoters, the perception that the 2% tax Pacific Rim would pay on its revenues, and other social and environmental concerns were behind the resistance to the proposed mining project.<ref>Freeston, Jesse.

Hundert is a Kitchener-based activist who was arrested in a house raid before the G-20 began and charged, alongside 17 other activists, with conspiracy. After being released on bail, Hundert was re-arrested and jailed for participating as an invited speaker on a university panel at Ryerson University in Toronto. The government argued that his participation on a panel broke his bail condition barring him from participating in public protests. The courts agreed and adjusted Hundert's bail conditions to ban all political speech, including to the media. In an apparent challenge to the ban, Freeston published a 10-minute video that included a lengthy interview with Hundert, which according to Freeston was filmed before the ban was put into place.<ref>Freeston, Jesse.

In his \"Inscriptions\" chapter of Petrie's 1897 publication \"Six Temples at Thebes\", Spiegelberg described the stele as \"engraved on the rough back of the stele of [[Amenhotep III]], which was removed from his temple, and placed back outward, against the wall, in the forecourt of the temple of Merneptah. Owing to the rough surface, and the poor cutting, the readings in many places require careful examination... The scene at the top retains its original colouring of yellow, red, and blue.

Most of the text glorifies Merneptah's victories over enemies from Libya and their Sea People allies, but the final two lines mention a campaign in Canaan, where Merneptah says he defeated and destroyed Ashkalon, Gezer, Yanoam and Israel.\n\nEgypt was the dominant power in the region during the long reign of Merneptah's predecessor, [[Ramesses the Great]], but Merneptah and one of his nearest successors, [[Ramesses III]], faced major invasions. The problems began in Merneptah's 5th year (1208), when a Libyan king invaded Egypt from the west in alliance with various northern peoples. Merneptah achieved a great victory in the summer of that year, and the inscription is mainly about this. The final lines deal with an apparently separate campaign in the East, where it seems that some of the Canaanite cities had revolted. Traditionally the Egyptians had concerned themselves only with cities, so the problem presented by Israel must have been something new \u2013 possibly attacks on Egypt's vassals in Canaan. Merneptah and Ramesses III fought off their enemies, but it was the beginning of the end of Egypt's control over Canaan \u2013 the last evidence of an Egyptian presence in the area is the name of [[Ramesses VI]] (1141\u20131133) inscribed on a statue base from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]].{{sfn|Drews|1995|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n==Lines 26\u201328==\n[[File:THnnww.gif|right|thumb|200px|[[Libya]]ns (Tje\u1e25enu) are described by determinatives: foreign person + people + [[hill-country (hieroglyph)|foreign country]] (=state/country of Libyan people)]]\nThe bulk of the inscription deals with Merneptah's victory over the Libyans, but the last 3 of the 28 lines shift to Canaan:{{sfn|Sparks|1998|pp= 96\u201397}}\n{{Quote | <poem>The princes are prostrate, saying, \"Peace!\"\nNot one is raising his head among the Nine Bows.\nNow that Tehenu (Libya) has come to ruin,\n:Hatti is pacified;\n::The Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe:\n:::[[Ashkelon]] has been overcome;\n:::[[Gezer]] has been captured;\n:::[[Yenoam|Yano'am]] is made non-existent.\nIsrael is laid waste and his seed is not;\nHurru is become a widow because of Egypt.</poem>}}\n\nThe \"nine bows\" is a term the Egyptians used to refer to their enemies; the actual enemies varied according to time and circumstance.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ancient-egypt.co.uk/fitzwilliam/index_2.htm | title = FitzWilliam Museum | publisher = Ancient Egypt | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.</ref> Hatti and \u1e2aurru are Assyrian, Canaan and Israel are smaller units, and Ashkelon, Gezer and Yanoam are cities within the region; according to the stele, all these entities fell under the rule of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire at that time]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|p= 26}}\n\n== Line 27 ==\n===\"Israel\"===\nPetrie called upon Wilhelm Spiegelberg, a German philologist in his archaeological team, to translate the inscription.

Nibbi supports this by noting that the male figure has an apparent outgrowth of hair on the side of his head.{{sfn|Nibbi|1989|p=101}}}}\n\nHowever, these remain minority interpretations.{{efn|Hasel (2008): \"The view that the term ysry\u00b7r/l is a possible territory within Canaan but not associated with biblical Israel was proposed by Othniel Margalith (1990). His conclusions are based on the suggestion by G. R. Driver (1948: 135) that the Egyptian letter 's' in the word could also represent the Hebrew [[zayin]]. Accordingly, the name ysry\u00b7r/l could be translated as Iezreel \"which might be an inexperienced way of rendering Yezreel, the valley to the north of the country\" (Margalith 1990: 229). As others have pointed out elsewhere, Margalith\u2019s attempts to identify the entity ysry\u00b7r/l with Israel or Jezreel through Ugaritic vocalizations and a Sumerian title of a king are not convincing for an Egyptian inscription with a clear context for this entity in Canaan (Hasel 1994: 46; 1998a: 196\u201397; compare Kitchen 1966a: 91).\"'' and ''\"The suggestion of equating the ysry\u00b7r/l of the stela with Jezreel has now been taken up anew by I. Hjelm and Thomas L. Thompson (2002: 14) without any reference to earlier discussions. The identification is rife with difficulties. First, the Egyptian signs for \"bolt\" (Gardiner 1957: 507, O34) and \"folded cloth\" (Gardiner 1957: 507, S29) in Old Egyptian represented the sound s. In the New Kingdom, Hebrew zayin is rendered q or t in Egyptian and not s (Kitchen 1966a: 91, 1966b 59; Helck 1971: 18, 554, 589). Second, ysry\u00b7r/l does not include the Egyptian equivalent of ayin needed for the reading yzr\u00aal. Third, the reading \u201cJezreel\u201d must assume that the determinative for people used with ysry\u00b7r/ l was a scribal error, because it does not fit the designation of a geographical location. The orthographic and philological reasons mitigate the reading of ysry\u00b7r/ l as Jezreel (see also Kitchen 2004).\"{{sfn|Hasel|2008|pp=47\u201360}}}}\n\n===Interpretation===\nIt is not clear, however, just who this Israel was or where they were located.<ref>Dermot Anthony Nestor,[https://books.google.com/books?id=arOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 ''Cognitive Perspectives on Israelite Identity,''] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010 p. 191: 'while the Merneptah stele may indeed prove beyond doubt that shortly before 1200 B.C.E. Egyptian intelligence either encountered or was informed of an inimical \"Israel\" residing in the highlands of Palestine, and that it was considered significant enough to warrant inclusion in the only known campaign of Merneptah in this region, any attempt by biblical scholars to translate this practical category into the substantialist idiom of an internally homogeneous, externally bounded group which serves to demarcate the evolution of that singular, regulative and constituting cultural tradition identified textually and archaeologically as \"Israel\" simply cannot be sustained.'</ref>{{efn|Davies (2008): \"Assuming we have Merneptah's dates correctly as 1213\u20131203, and that the reading \"Israel\" is correct, the reference places an Israel in Palestine in the thirteenth century. The word read (probably correctly) as \"Israel\" also has a sign indicating a people and not a place. That makes the alternative reading \"Jezreel\" less likely \u2013 though Hebrew \"s\" and \"z\" could both be represented by the same Egyptian letter; also, since \"Jezreel\" is partly made up of the word for \"seed\", the inscription could be a pun by a Semitic speaking scribe. It might also be considered that Merneptah would find it easier to fight in the plain of Jezreel than in the highlands.\"{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=90\u201391}}}} The reference to Israel in the stele has spawned two major schools of thought. The traditional schools of thought identify the 'Israel' in the stele with the Biblical Israel. However, the inquiries of the minimalist school of thought which doubts the biblical narrative's antiquity have impacted on the interpretation of the stele.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenton L. Sparks|title=Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the Study of Ethnic Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KztVonFGqcsC&pg=PA95|year=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-033-0|pages=95\u2013}}</ref> For the \"who\", if those depicted on the battle reliefs of [[Karnak]] are the Israelites, then Merneptah's Israelites are therefore Canaanites, because they are depicted in Canaanite costume; if, on the other hand, the Karnak reliefs do not show Merneptah's campaigns, then the stele's Israelites may be \"[[Shasu]]\", a term used by the Egyptians to refer to nomads and marauders.{{sfn|Whitelam|1997|p=26, fn. 16}}\n\nSimilarly, if Merneptah's claim to have destroyed Israel's \"seed\" means that he destroyed its grain supply, then Israel can be taken to be a settled, crop-growing people; if, however, it means he killed Israel's progeny, then Israel can be taken to be pastoralists, i.e., Shasu.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=154}} The normative Egyptian use of \"wasted, bare of seed\" was as a repeated, formulaic phrase to declare victory over a defeated nation or people group whom the Egyptian army conquered and had literally destroyed their grain supply in the specific geographic region that they inhabited.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=97}} Michael G. Hasel, arguing that ''prt'' on the stele meant grain, suggested that \"Israel functioned as an agriculturally based or sedentary socioethnic entity in the late 13th century BCE\"<ref name=\"autogenerated54\">{{Citation |first = Michael G.|last = Hasel|title = Israel in the Merneptah Stela|journal = BASOR|volume = 296|year = 1994|pages = 54, 56|number = 12}}.</ref> and this in some degree of contrast to nomadic \"Shasu\" pastoralists in the region. Others disagree that ''prt'' meant grain, and [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] wrote that \"the 'classical' opposition of nomadic shepherds and settled farmers does not seem to suit the area concerned\".<ref>{{cite book|last= Lipinski|first = Edward | title = On the Skirts of Canaan in the Iron Age: Historical and Topographical Researches|year= 2006 | publisher = Peeters| isbn = 978-90-429-1798-9 |page=60}}</ref> Hasel also says that this does not suggest that the Israelites were an urban people at this time, nor does it provide information about the actual social structure of the people group identified as Israel.<ref name=\"autogenerated54\" /> Biblical scholar [[Thomas L. Thompson]] writes that \"this name in the Merneptah inscription of the late thirteenth-century might conceivably understand it as the name of a region, in polarity with the clearly geographical name: ''Canaan''.\" Also, \"The group 'Israel' ... are rather a very specific group among the population of Palestine which bears a name that occurs here for the first time that at a much later stage in Palestine's history bears a substantially different signification.\" For, \"References to the Merneptah stele are not really helpful. This text renders for us only the earliest known usage of the name 'Israel'.\" So, \"to begin the origins of biblical Israel with Merneptah ... on the grounds that we have extra-biblical rather than biblical attestation is willful. These texts are, ''mirabile dictu'', even less relevant than the biblical traditions.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/earlyhistoryofis00thom/page/404 Early History of the Israelite People], Thomas L. Thompson, pp. 139, 311, 404. Quote: \"With the 'Israel' stele we have only a name in an historical context in which the shifting signification and dislocation of regional and gentilic toponymy over centuries is a commonplace\"</ref>\n\nAs for its location, most scholars believe that Merneptah's Israel must have been in the hill country of central Canaan, but some think it was across the Jordan, others that it was a coalition of Canaanite settlements in the lowlands of the Yezrael valley (the potential Israelites on the walls of Karnak are driving chariots, a weapon of the lowlands rather than the highlands), and others that the inscription gives very little useful information at all.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=115\u201316}}\n\n==Karnak reliefs==\nThe stele was found in Merenptah's funerary chapel in Thebes, the ancient Egyptian capital on the west bank of the Nile.  On the opposite bank is the Temple of Karnak, where the fragmentary copy was found. In the 1970s Frank Yurco announced that some reliefs at Karnak which had been thought to depict events in the reign of Ramesses II, Merenptah's father, in fact belonged to Merenptah. The four reliefs show the capture of three cities, one of them labelled as Ashkelon; Yurco suggested that the other two were Gezer and Yanoam. The fourth shows a battle in open hilly country against an enemy shown as Canaanite. Yurco suggested that this scene was to be equated with the Israel of the stele. While the idea that Merneptah's Israelites are to be seen on the walls of the temple has had an influence on many theories regarding the significance of the inscription, not all Egyptologists accept Yurco's ascription of the reliefs to Merneptah.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p= 155}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]\n* [[New Chronology (Rohl)]]\n\n== Notes

In his \"Inscriptions\" chapter of Petrie's 1897 publication \"Six Temples at Thebes\", Spiegelberg described the stele as \"engraved on the rough back of the stele of [[Amenhotep III]], which was removed from his temple, and placed back outward, against the wall, in the forecourt of the temple of Merneptah. Owing to the rough surface, and the poor cutting, the readings in many places require careful examination... The scene at the top retains its original colouring of yellow, red, and blue. [[Amun]] is shown giving a sword to the king, who is backed by [[Mut]] on one side and by [[Khonsu]] on the other\".{{sfn| Petrie|Spiegelberg |1897|p=[https://archive.org/stream/sixtemplesattheb00petruoft#page/26/mode/1up 26]}}\n\nNow in the collection of the [[Egyptian Museum]] at [[Cairo]], the stele is a black granite slab, over 3 meters (10 feet) high, and the inscription says it was carved in the 5th year of Merneptah of the 19th dynasty. Most of the text glorifies Merneptah's victories over enemies from Libya and their Sea People allies, but the final two lines mention a campaign in Canaan, where Merneptah says he defeated and destroyed Ashkalon, Gezer, Yanoam and Israel.\n\nEgypt was the dominant power in the region during the long reign of Merneptah's predecessor, [[Ramesses the Great]], but Merneptah and one of his nearest successors, [[Ramesses III]], faced major invasions. The problems began in Merneptah's 5th year (1208), when a Libyan king invaded Egypt from the west in alliance with various northern peoples. Merneptah achieved a great victory in the summer of that year, and the inscription is mainly about this. The final lines deal with an apparently separate campaign in the East, where it seems that some of the Canaanite cities had revolted. Traditionally the Egyptians had concerned themselves only with cities, so the problem presented by Israel must have been something new \u2013 possibly attacks on Egypt's vassals in Canaan. Merneptah and Ramesses III fought off their enemies, but it was the beginning of the end of Egypt's control over Canaan \u2013 the last evidence of an Egyptian presence in the area is the name of [[Ramesses VI]] (1141\u20131133) inscribed on a statue base from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]].{{sfn|Drews|1995|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n==Lines 26\u201328==\n[[File:THnnww.gif|right|thumb|200px|[[Libya]]ns (Tje\u1e25enu) are described by determinatives: foreign person + people + [[hill-country (hieroglyph)|foreign country]] (=state/country of Libyan people)]]\nThe bulk of the inscription deals with Merneptah's victory over the Libyans, but the last 3 of the 28 lines shift to Canaan:{{sfn|Sparks|1998|pp= 96\u201397}}\n{{Quote | <poem>The princes are prostrate, saying, \"Peace!\"\nNot one is raising his head among the Nine Bows.\nNow that Tehenu (Libya) has come to ruin,\n:Hatti is pacified;\n::The Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe:\n:::[[Ashkelon]] has been overcome;\n:::[[Gezer]] has been captured;\n:::[[Yenoam|Yano'am]] is made non-existent.\nIsrael is laid waste and his seed is not;\nHurru is become a widow because of Egypt.</poem>}}\n\nThe \"nine bows\" is a term the Egyptians used to refer to their enemies; the actual enemies varied according to time and circumstance.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ancient-egypt.co.uk/fitzwilliam/index_2.htm | title = FitzWilliam Museum | publisher = Ancient Egypt | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.</ref> Hatti and \u1e2aurru are Syro-Palestine, Canaan and Israel are smaller units, and Ashkelon, Gezer and Yanoam are cities within the region; according to the stele, all these entities fell under the rule of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire at that time]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|p= 26}}\n\n== Line 27 ==\n===\"Israel\"===\nPetrie called upon Wilhelm Spiegelberg, a German philologist in his archaeological team, to translate the inscription.

Nibbi supports this by noting that the male figure has an apparent outgrowth of hair on the side of his head.{{sfn|Nibbi|1989|p=101}}}}\n\nHowever, these remain minority interpretations.{{efn|Hasel (2008): \"The view that the term ysry\u00b7r/l is a possible territory within Canaan but not associated with biblical Israel was proposed by Othniel Margalith (1990). His conclusions are based on the suggestion by G. R. Driver (1948: 135) that the Egyptian letter 's' in the word could also represent the Hebrew [[zayin]]. Accordingly, the name ysry\u00b7r/l could be translated as Iezreel \"which might be an inexperienced way of rendering Yezreel, the valley to the north of the country\" (Margalith 1990: 229). As others have pointed out elsewhere, Margalith\u2019s attempts to identify the entity ysry\u00b7r/l with Israel or Jezreel through Ugaritic vocalizations and a Sumerian title of a king are not convincing for an Egyptian inscription with a clear context for this entity in Canaan (Hasel 1994: 46; 1998a: 196\u201397; compare Kitchen 1966a: 91).\"'' and ''\"The suggestion of equating the ysry\u00b7r/l of the stela with Jezreel has now been taken up anew by I. Hjelm and Thomas L. Thompson (2002: 14) without any reference to earlier discussions. The identification is rife with difficulties. First, the Egyptian signs for \"bolt\" (Gardiner 1957: 507, O34) and \"folded cloth\" (Gardiner 1957: 507, S29) in Old Egyptian represented the sound s. In the New Kingdom, Hebrew zayin is rendered q or t in Egyptian and not s (Kitchen 1966a: 91, 1966b 59; Helck 1971: 18, 554, 589). Second, ysry\u00b7r/l does not include the Egyptian equivalent of ayin needed for the reading yzr\u00aal. Third, the reading \u201cJezreel\u201d must assume that the determinative for people used with ysry\u00b7r/ l was a scribal error, because it does not fit the designation of a geographical location. The orthographic and philological reasons mitigate the reading of ysry\u00b7r/ l as Jezreel (see also Kitchen 2004).\"{{sfn|Hasel|2008|pp=47\u201360}}}}\n\n===Interpretation===\nIt is not clear, however, just who this Israel was or where they were located.<ref>Dermot Anthony Nestor,[https://books.google.com/books?id=arOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 ''Cognitive Perspectives on Israelite Identity,''] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010 p. 191: 'while the Merneptah stele may indeed prove beyond doubt that shortly before 1200 B.C.E. Egyptian intelligence either encountered or was informed of an inimical \"Israel\" residing in the highlands of Palestine, and that it was considered significant enough to warrant inclusion in the only known campaign of Merneptah in this region, any attempt by biblical scholars to translate this practical category into the substantialist idiom of an internally homogeneous, externally bounded group which serves to demarcate the evolution of that singular, regulative and constituting cultural tradition identified textually and archaeologically as \"Israel\" simply cannot be sustained.'</ref>{{efn|Davies (2008): \"Assuming we have Merneptah's dates correctly as 1213\u20131203, and that the reading \"Israel\" is correct, the reference places an Israel in Palestine in the thirteenth century. The word read (probably correctly) as \"Israel\" also has a sign indicating a people and not a place. That makes the alternative reading \"Jezreel\" less likely \u2013 though Hebrew \"s\" and \"z\" could both be represented by the same Egyptian letter; also, since \"Jezreel\" is partly made up of the word for \"seed\", the inscription could be a pun by a Semitic speaking scribe. It might also be considered that Merneptah would find it easier to fight in the plain of Jezreel than in the highlands.\"{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=90\u201391}}}} The reference to Israel in the stele has spawned two major schools of thought.

This text renders for us only the earliest known usage of the name 'Israel'.\" So, \"to begin the origins of biblical Israel with Merneptah ... on the grounds that we have extra-biblical rather than biblical attestation is willful.

On the opposite bank is the Temple of Karnak, where the fragmentary copy was found. In the 1970s Frank Yurco announced that some reliefs at Karnak which had been thought to depict events in the reign of Ramesses II, Merenptah's father, in fact belonged to Merenptah. The four reliefs show the capture of three cities, one of them labelled as Ashkelon; Yurco suggested that the other two were Gezer and Yanoam. The fourth shows a battle in open hilly country against an enemy shown as Canaanite. Yurco suggested that this scene was to be equated with the Israel of the stele. While the idea that Merneptah's Israelites are to be seen on the walls of the temple has had an influence on many theories regarding the significance of the inscription, not all Egyptologists accept Yurco's ascription of the reliefs to Merneptah.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p= 155}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]\n* [[New Chronology (Rohl)]]\n\n== Notes

In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.\n\nEarly leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary.

Isolation treatment methods were observed by Surgeon-Mayor [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] of the British Colony in India while visiting Norway, and these methods were applied in India with the financial and logistical assistance of religious missionaries.

In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.\n\nEarly leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary.

Isolation treatment methods were observed by Surgeon-Mayor [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] of the British Colony in India while visiting Norway, and these methods were applied in India with the financial and logistical assistance of religious missionaries.

The line was surveyed between 1924 and 1925, with a short industrial branch leaving the Hutt Valley Branch at Woburn to serve the new Hutt Workshops. On 26 May 1927 the rails reached Waterloo, which was then in the middle of open fields.

The station was opened with automatic, three-aspect colour light signals which had been standard since 1924.\n\nIt was always intended that Waterloo would one day serve a major population centre which, in the years following World War II and the population boom that ensued, was proved correct. Significant urban development of the Hutt Valley in the 1940s led to the decision in February 1946 to commence electrification in 1949 and to operate electric train between Waterloo and Wellington from August 1953. Until the connection of the Hutt Valley Branch to the Wairarapa Line and its opening as the new mainline on 1 March 1954, Waterloo served only suburban passenger services, with Upper Hutt and Wairarapa trains continuing to use the old line between Haywards and Petone on the western side of the Hutt Valley.\n\nIn 1986, as a result of the Hutt Valley Transport Study, Waterloo was designated an interchange for bus and rail services in preference to Woburn, which had previously had this role.  It was felt that Waterloo was a more logical choice as it was closer to centres of residential and commercial interest, had sufficient room for bus platforms to be installed, and was not burdened with other operational requirements such as Woburn being the junction with the Gracefield Branch, with its loops and sidings.

He was first a Tory and later a Whig politician who sat in the [[Parliament of Ireland]] from 1692 to 1738, and in the [[English House of Commons]] and [[British House of Commons ]] between 1705 and 1734.\n\n==Early life==\nMedlycott was baptized on 22 May 1662, the third son of [[Thomas Medlycott (died 1716)|Thomas Medlycott]] of Abingdon, Berkshire. He was admitted at [[Middle Temple]] in 1680 and was called to the bar in 1687. He married by licence dated 1 January 1687, Sarah Goddard, daughter of Mrs Ursula Goddard, widow, of Mugwell (Monkwell) Street, Cripplegate, London.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/medlycott-thomas-1662-1738 | title= MEDLYCOTT, Thomas (1662-1738), of Binfield, Berks. and Dublin, Ireland | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690-1715)| accessdate = 21 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Career in Ireland==\nMedlycott began his career in Ireland as secretary and estate manager to [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde]]. He was called to the Irish bar 1691 and appointed Attorney-general for the [[County palatine]] of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] by 1692. In 1692 he was returned as Irish Member of Parliament for [[Kildare Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kildare Borough]]  and became Freeman of Drogheda on 1694. He was returned again for Kildare in 1695. In 1697, he was entrusted with a sensitive task of organizing opposition to a bill confirming the King's grant of James II's Irish estates. King William had overridden the former King's settlement of estates, worth about \u00a322,000, on his children and had given them to [[Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney|Elizabeth Villiers]], allegedly William III's mistress, which had particularly upset [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]]. Medlycott obtained lands in Kilkenny, Tipperary and Waterford from the Duke of Ormonde in 1698 and 1699 and in 1701 purchased more land in Mayo from Ormond's brother, Lord Arran. In 1703 he was returned as Irish MP for [[Clonmel (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Clonmell]]  and in 1713 for [[Ballynakill (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ballynakill]].<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==Career in Westminster==\nBy 1705 Medlycott's brother [[James Medlycott|James]] had increased his electoral influence at [[Milborne Port (UK Parliament constituency)|Milborne Port]]  by acquiring additional burgages. At the [[1705 English general election]], Medlycott stood for the borough where his return was virtually guaranteed. During the election campaign the post of deputy-steward of Westminster became available and he immediately wrote to Ormond, the high steward, reminding him that he had previously promised him this office. The Duke kept his word and also obtained a commission in the Irish guards for Medlycott's son. Medlycott was returned in a contest as [[Member of Parliament]] for Milborne Port on his family's interest. In Parliament he voted with the Whigs and the moderate Tories on 25 October 1705 in favour of the Court candidate for Speaker, but in February 1706 he supported the Tories in a disputed election case. He was an assiduous member particularly with regard to Westminster matters. He was involved in three private bills, but his main concern was a bill for the prevention of fires.  At the [[1708 British general election]]  he was returned as MP for Milborne Port and also for [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] where he chose to sit once a petition against his return had been decided in his favour. He continued working hard, particularly with regard to urban matters.  Measures he was involved in included tightening the provisions of his Fires Act, establishing a workhouse in St. Martin-in-the-Fields,  extending the powers of London's commissioners of sewers, regulating hackney coaches, incorporating peruke-makers into the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, raising the militia and limiting long periods of public mourning because of the disastrous effects on the silk trade. He initiated a private estate bill on behalf of the Irish peer Viscount Gormanston and two other estate bills.  In 1710, he followed the Tory line in voting against the impeachment of [[Henry Sacheverell|Dr Sacheverell]].<ref name=HOP/>\n \nMedlycott was returned in a contest at the [[1710 British general election]] and was listed as a \u2018Tory patriot\u2019 who voted for peace during the course of 1711, and as a \u2018worthy patriot\u2019 who assisted in detecting the mismanagements of the former administration. He was also a member of the October Club.. He became a bencher of his Inn in 1712 and in July 1712 was appointed Commissioner of Revenue and Excise for Ireland by Robert Harley Lord Treasurer. He was returned unopposed at the [[1713 British general election]] by which time he was described as a Tory who sometimes voted with the Whig. He spoke in favour of the motion condemning Richard Steele's* published attacks on the ministry on 18 March 1714, but was aligned with the [[Hanoverian Tories]] and spoke on the Court side in the debate on the succession and on 22 April in support of the address of thanks for the peace. He became Chairman of the Committee of elections and privileges in 1714. In July he petitioned Lord Oxford for repayment of the expenses he had incurred back in 1697 carrying out the Queen's commands with regard to her father's former Irish estates when she was princess. However, Anne's death a fortnight later pre-empted any chance of reimbursement. He retained his Irish post as Commissioner for Revenue and Excise after joining the Whigs.<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==Later career==\nMedlycott did not stand at the [[1715 British general election]] but was returned as Irish MP for [[Downpatrick (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Downpatrick]]. He remained in Ireland occupied with his official duties and his private affairs. He lost his Irish post in July 1727 but was returned as MP for Milborne Port at the [[1727 British general election]]. He was also returned for the Parliament of Ireland seat at [[Newtown Limavady (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newtown Limvady]] in 1727. He was reinstated as Commissioner for revenue and excise for Ireland in February 1728 and held it until October 1733 when his son-in-law was appointed his successor, on the ground that Medlycott was \u2018obliged to remain in England as a Member of Parliament\u2019.  In the House he voted with the Government for the excise bill and against the repeal of the Septennial Act. His only recorded speech was made on 21 February 1733 against the clause in a bill relating to the restrictive import of sugar, molasses and rum into Ireland.  He was defeated at Milborne Port at the [[1734 British general election]]  by his nephew, [[Thomas Medlycott (died 1763)|Thomas Medlycott ]]<ref name = HOP2>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/medlycott-thomas-1662-1738 | title= MEDLYCOTT, Thomas (1662-1738), of Binfield, Berks. and Dublin. | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1715-1754)| accessdate = 21 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nMedlycott died before September 1738, leaving two sons and a daughter by his wife Sarah.

In 1692 he was returned as Irish Member of Parliament for [[Kildare Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kildare Borough]]  and became Freeman of Drogheda on 1694. He was returned again for Kildare in 1695. In 1697, he was entrusted with a sensitive task of organizing opposition to a bill confirming the King\u2019s grant of James II\u2019s Irish estates. King William had overridden the former King\u2019s settlement of estates, worth about \u00a322,000, on his children and had given them to [[Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney|Elizabeth Villiers]], allegedly William III\u2019s mistress, which had particularly upset [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]]. Medlycott obtained lands in Kilkenny, Tipperary and Waterford from the Duke of Ormonde in 1698 and 1699 and in 1701 purchased more land in Mayo from Ormond\u2019s brother, Lord Arran. In 1703 he was returned as Irish MP for [[Clonmel (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Clonmell]]  and in 1713 for [[Ballynakill (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ballynakill]].<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==Career in Westminster==\nBy 1705 Medlycott\u2019s brother [[James Medlycott|James]] had increased his electoral influence at [[Milborne Port (UK Parliament constituency)|Milborne Port]]  by acquiring additional burgages. At the [[1705 English general election]], Medlycott stood for the borough where his return was virtually guaranteed. During the election campaign the post of deputy-steward of Westminster became available and he immediately wrote to Ormond, the high steward, reminding him that he had previously promised him this office. The Duke kept his word and also obtained a commission in the Irish guards for Medlycott\u2019s son. Medlycott was returned in a contest as [[Member of Parliament]] for Milborne Port on his family\u2019s interest. In Parliament he voted with the Whigs and the moderate Tories on 25 October 1705 in favour of the Court candidate for Speaker, but in February 1706 he supported the Tories in a disputed election case. He was an assiduous member particularly with regard to Westminster matters. He was involved in three private bills, but his main concern was a bill for the prevention of fires.  At the [[1708 British general election]]  he was returned as MP for Milborne Port and also for [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] where he chose to sit once a petition against his return had been decided in his favour. He continued working hard, particularly with regard to urban matters.  Measures he was involved in included tightening the provisions of his Fires Act, establishing a workhouse in St. Martin-in-the-Fields,  extending the powers of London\u2019s commissioners of sewers, regulating hackney coaches, incorporating peruke-makers into the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, raising the militia and limiting long periods of public mourning because of the disastrous effects on the silk trade. He initiated a private estate bill on behalf of the Irish peer Viscount Gormanston and two other estate bills.  In 1710, he followed the Tory line in voting against the impeachment of [[Henry Sacheverell|Dr Sacheverell]].<ref name=HOP/>\n \nMedlycott was returned in a contest at the [[1710 British general election]] and was listed as a \u2018Tory patriot\u2019 who voted for peace during the course of 1711, and as a \u2018worthy patriot\u2019 who assisted in detecting the mismanagements of the former administration. He was also a member of the October Club.. He became a bencher of his Inn in 1712 and in July 1712 was appointed Commissioner of Revenue and Excise for Ireland by Robert Harley Lord Treasurer. He was returned unopposed at the [[1713 British general election]] by which time he was described as a Tory who sometimes voted with the Whig. He spoke in favour of the motion condemning Richard Steele\u2019s* published attacks on the ministry on 18 March 1714, but was aligned with the [[Hanoverian Tories]] and spoke on the Court side in the debate on the succession and on 22 April in support of the address of thanks for the peace. He became Chairman of the Committee of elections and privileges in 1714. In July he petitioned Lord Oxford for repayment of the expenses he had incurred back in 1697 carrying out the Queen\u2019s commands with regard to her father\u2019s former Irish estates when she was princess. However, Anne\u2019s death a fortnight later pre-empted any chance of reimbursement. He retained his Irish post as Commissioner for Revenue and Excise after joining the Whigs.<ref name=HOP/>\n\n==Later career==\nMedlycott did not stand at the [[1715 British general election]] but was returned as Irish MP for [[Downpatrick (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Downpatrick]]. He remained in Ireland occupied with his official duties and his private affairs. He lost his Irish post in July 1727 but was returned as MP for Milborne Port at the [[1727 British general election]]. He was also returned for the Parliament of Ireland seat at [[Newtown Limavady (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newtown Limvady]] in 1727. He was reinstated as Commissioner for revenue and excise for Ireland in February 1728 and held it until October 1733 when his son-in-law was appointed his successor, on the ground that Medlycott was \u2018obliged to remain in England as a Member of Parliament\u2019.  In the House he voted with the Government for the excise bill and against the repeal of the Septennial Act. His only recorded speech was made on 21 February 1733 against the clause in a bill relating to the restrictive import of sugar, molasses and rum into Ireland.  He was defeated at Milborne Port at the [[1734 British general election]]  by his nephew, [[Thomas Medlycott (died 1763)|Thomas Medlycott ]]<ref name = HOP2>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/medlycott-thomas-1662-1738 | title= MEDLYCOTT, Thomas (1662-1738), of Binfield, Berks. and Dublin. | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1715-1754)| accessdate = 21 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nMedlycott died before September 1738, leaving two sons and a daughter by his wife Sarah.
