It provides that an armed attack on any of the three parties would be dangerous to the others, and that each should act to meet the common threat. It set up a committee of foreign ministers that can meet for consultation.\n\nThe treaty was one of the series that the United States formed in the 1949\u20131955 era as part of its collective response to the threat of [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Joseph Gabriel Starke, ''The ANZUS Treaty Alliance'' (Melbourne University Press, 1965)</ref> New Zealand was suspended from ANZUS in 1986 as it initiated a [[New Zealand nuclear-free zone|nuclear-free zone]] in its territorial waters; in late 2012 the United States lifted a ban on visits by New Zealand warships leading to a thawing in tensions. New Zealand maintains a nuclear-free zone as part of its foreign policy and is partially suspended from ANZUS, as the United States maintains an ambiguous policy whether or not the warships carry nuclear weapons and operates numerous nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines; however New Zealand resumed key areas of the ANZUS treaty in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-21/news/sns-rt-us-defense-panettabre88k031-20120920_1_nuclear-warships-nuclear-free-washington-and-wellington|title=U.S. lifts ban on New Zealand warships, New Zealand keeps nuclear-free stance|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/blogs/security/2012/09/newzealand/|title=In Warming US-NZ Relations, Outdated Nuclear Policy Remains Unnecessary Irritant|work=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref>\n\n==Treaty structure==\nThe treaty was previously a full three-way defence pact, but following a dispute between [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] in 1984 over visiting rights for ships and submarines capable of carrying nuclear arms<ref>The test for ship access was decided as nuclear capability not actual proof of nuclear armament by a NZLP 1984 committee of President Margaret Wilson, Chair of the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee and MP and former President Jim Anderton and MP Fran Wilde ,</ref> or nuclear-powered ships of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] to New Zealand ports, the treaty became between [[Australia]] and New Zealand and between Australia and the United States, i.e. the treaty has lapsed between the United States and New Zealand, although it remains separately in force between both of those states and Australia.<ref>King M: 2003, The Penguin History of New Zealand, Penguin Books (NZ) Ltd, Auckland 1310, New Zealand. p426 and pp. 495\u20136</ref> In 2000, the United States opened its ports to the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] once again, and under the [[presidency of Bill Clinton]] in the US and the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|government of Helen Clark]] in New Zealand, the countries have since reestablished bilateral cooperation on defence and security for world peace.<ref name=\"crs\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42993.pdf|title=New Zealand: U.S. Security Cooperation and the U.S. Rebalancing to Asia Strategy, government report, 8 March 2013, Congressional Research Service|publisher=FAS.org|date=8 March 2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile ANZUS is commonly recognised to have split in 1984, the Australia\u2013US alliance remains in full force. Heads of defence of one or both states often have joined the annual ministerial meetings, which are supplemented by consultations between the US Combatant Commander Pacific and the Australian Chief of Defence Force. There are also regular civilian and military consultations between the two governments at lower levels.\n\nAnnual meetings to discuss ANZUS defence matters take place between the United States Secretaries of Defense and State and the Australian Ministers of Defence and Foreign Affairs are known by the acronym [[AUSMIN]]. The AUSMIN meeting for 2011 took place in San Francisco in September. The 2012 AUSMIN meeting was in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2011/kr_mr_110914.html |title=AUSMIN 2011, media release, 14 September 2011, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs |publisher=Foreignminister.gov.au |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), ANZUS has no integrated defence structure or dedicated forces. Nevertheless, Australia and the United States conduct a variety of joint activities. These include military exercises ranging from naval and landing exercises at the task-group level to battalion-level special forces training, assigning officers to each other's armed services, and standardising equipment and operational doctrine. The two countries also operate several joint-defence facilities in Australia, mainly ground stations for [[spy satellite]], and [[signals intelligence]] [[espionage]] in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] as part of the [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON]] network.\n\nDuring the 2010s, New Zealand and the US resumed a close relationship, although it is unclear whether the revived partnership falls under the aegis of the 1951 trilateral treaty. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 defined a \"strategic partnership\" between New Zealand and the US, and New Zealand joined the biennial [[Rim of the Pacific]] military exercise off [[Hawaii]] in 2012, for the first time since 1984. The US prohibition on New Zealand ships making port at US bases was lifted after the 2012 exercise.<ref name=\"crs\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2019}}<!--Afghanistan, East Timor, and Taiwan sections lack footnotes-->\n[[File:P-3B RNZAF USN MirageIII RAAF 1983.jpeg|thumb|Australian, New Zealand, and United States aircraft during a military exercise in 1982]]\n\n===Origins===\nIn the years following the Second World War, Australia and New Zealand began pressing the United States for a formal security guarantee.

But the need to strengthen the West against communism grew with the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 and the 1950-1953 [[Korean War]]. Additionally, the United States wanted to gain Australian and New Zealand approval for a 'soft peace' with Japan. The treaty allayed antipodean fears that such a peace would allow Japan to threaten them again.<ref>David McLean,  \"Anzus Origins: A Reassessment,\" ''Australian Historical Studies'' 24#94 (1990), pp. 64-82.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/anzus-comes-into-force|title=ANZUS treaty comes into force {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting treaty was concluded at San Francisco on 1 September 1951, and entered into force on 29 April 1952. The treaty bound the signatories to recognise that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of them would endanger the peace and safety of the others. It stated 'The Parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened in the Pacific'. The three nations also pledged to maintain and develop individual and collective capabilities to resist attack.<ref>William David McIntyre, , '' Background to the Anzus Pact: Policy-Making, Strategy and Diplomacy, 1945-55''  (1994)</ref>\n\n===Malaysia, Korea, Vietnam, and the War on Terror===\nThe treaty itself was not a source of debate for 30 years, though in this period New Zealand and Australia committed forces to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and subsequently the ANZUS nations fought together in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nAs part of the United Nations deployment, New Zealand and Australia had earlier fought alongside the United States in the Korean War. New Zealand sent transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft, and frigates to the Persian Gulf, as well as a very small number of soldiers, [[New Zealand Special Air Service|SAS]] soldiers, medical and assorted and peace-keeping forces, to Afghanistan in 2001. Despite Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] being openly critical of American justifications for the [[2003 Iraq war]], New Zealand did send engineer troops to Iraq following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3059403.stm |title=NZ PM backs Blair's Iraq conduct |work=BBC News |date=11 July 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> These troops were however officially engaged in reconstruction under UN Security Council Resolution 1483 and were non-combatant.\n\n===Australian reservations about the MX missile===\n{{See also|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#Australia}}\nIn 1983, the Reagan Administration approached Australia with proposals for testing the new generation of American [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]].

Despite these disagreements, the Hawke Labor Government still remained supportive of the ANZUS security treaty. It also did not support its New Zealand counterpart's ban on nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships. Following the ANZUS Split in February 1985, the Australian government also endorsed the Reagan Administration's plans to cancel trilateral military exercises and to postpone the ANZUS foreign ministers conference. However, it still continued to maintain bilateral military ties and continued to share intelligence information with New Zealand.<ref name=\"Ted Carpenter\" /> Unlike New Zealand, Australia continued to allow US warships to visit its ports and to participate in joint military exercises with the United States.<ref>\"US Ships to Visit Sydney\", ''[[The Southland Times]]'', 22 February 1985, p.1</ref><ref>\"US Ships to Visit Australian Ports\", ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 22 February 1985, p.1</ref>\n\n===New Zealand bans nuclear material===\n{{See also|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|Nuclear powered cruisers of the United States Navy}}\n\nIn 1985, the nature of the ANZUS alliance changed significantly. Due to a current of [[anti-nuclear]] sentiment within New Zealand, tension had long been present between ANZUS members as the United States is a declared nuclear power. France, a naval power and a declared nuclear power, had been conducting [[nuclear tests]] on South Pacific Islands. Following the victory of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in [[1984 New Zealand general election|election in 1984]], Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using New Zealand ports or entering [[New Zealand waters]]. Reasons given were the dangers of [[nuclear weapons]], continued [[French nuclear testing]] in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of aggressively confronting the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Amy L. Catalinac, \"Why New Zealand took itself out of ANZUS: observing \"opposition for autonomy\" in asymmetric alliances.\" ''Foreign Policy Analysis'' 6.4 (2010): 317-338.</ref>\n\nGiven that the United States Navy had a policy of deliberate ambiguity during the [[Cold War]] and [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|refused to confirm or deny]] the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its warships and support ships,<ref>\"The Operations Coordinating Board (part of President Eisenhower's National Security Council) established the US policy in 1958 of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any general or specific location, including aboard any US military station, ship, vehicle, or aircraft.\"{{cite web |last=Morgan |first=J.G., Jr. |date=3 February 2006 |title=Release of Information on Nuclear Weapons and on Nuclear Capabilities of U.S. Forces (OPNAVINST 5721.1F N5GP) |publisher=Department of the Navy&nbsp;\u2013 Office of the Chief of Naval Operations |location=Washington, DC |pages=1\u20132 |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/navy/opnavinst/5721_1f.pdf |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> these laws essentially refused access to New Zealand ports for all United States Navy vessels. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the guided-missile destroyer [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']] was refused by New Zealand, as the ''Buchanan'' was capable of launching [[nuclear depth bomb]]s. As this occurred after the government unofficially invited the United States to send a ship, the refusal of access was interpreted by the United States as a deliberate slight.\n\nAccording to opinion polls taken before the 1984 election, only 30 per cent of New Zealanders supported visits by US warships with a clear majority of 58 per cent opposed, and over 66 percent of the population lived in locally declared [[nuclear-free zone]]s.<ref>[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes25 Disarmament and Security Centre: Publications \u2013 Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614183526/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes25 |date=14 June 2006 }}</ref> An opinion poll commissioned by the 1986 Defence Committee of Enquiry confirmed that 92 per cent now opposed nuclear weapons in New Zealand and 69 per cent opposed warship visits; 92 per cent wanted New Zealand to promote [[nuclear disarmament]] through the UN, while 88 per cent supported the promotion of nuclear-free zones.<ref>[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes35 Disarmament and Security Centre: Publications \u2013 Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213164133/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes35 |date=13 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHowever other polls indicated that the majority of the population would support visits by American warships which might be nuclear armed or powered, if the alternative was that New Zealand would have to withdraw from ANZUS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===United States suspends obligations to New Zealand===\n{{See also|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#New Zealand}}\nAfter consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was \"a friend, but not an ally\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way: Books: David Lange, Michael Gifkins |isbn = 0140145192}}</ref> The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220134021/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |archivedate=2011-02-20|url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |title=The Australian National University |accessdate=2016-03-07}}</ref> David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand.\n\nAn opinion poll in New Zealand in 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm |title=NZ Nationals move closer to US |publisher=Green Left |date=12 June 1991 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202095327/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> showed 54% of those sampled preferred to let the treaty lapse rather than accept visits again by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels.

The operation was taken over by the United Nations.\n\n===Taiwan===\nOne topic that became prominent in the 2000s was the implications in the case of a hypothetical attack by the People's Republic of China against [[Taiwan]], who would likely receive American support. While Australia has strong cultural and economic ties with the United States, it also has an increasingly important trade relationship with China.\n\nIn August 2004, Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] implied in Beijing that the treaty would likely not apply to that situation, but he was quickly corrected by Prime Minister [[John Howard]]. In March 2005, after an official of the People's Republic of China stated that it may be necessary for Australia to reassess the treaty and after China passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] regarding Taiwan, Downer stated that in case of Chinese aggression on Taiwan, the treaty would come into force, but that the treaty would require only consultations with the United States and not necessarily commit Australia to war.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===1985 to present===\n{{Further|New Zealand \u2013 United States relations|Australia \u2013 United States relations|Australia \u2013 New Zealand relations}}\n\nAnnual bilateral meetings between the US Secretary of State and the Australian Foreign Minister replaced annual meetings of the ANZUS Council of Foreign Ministers.

It provides that an armed attack on any of the three parties would be dangerous to the others, and that each should act to meet the common threat. It set up a committee of foreign ministers that can meet for consultation.\n\nThe treaty was one of the series that the United States formed in the 1949\u20131955 era as part of its collective response to the threat of [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Joseph Gabriel Starke, ''The ANZUS Treaty Alliance'' (Melbourne University Press, 1965)</ref> New Zealand was suspended from ANZUS in 1986 as it initiated a [[New Zealand nuclear-free zone|nuclear-free zone]] in its territorial waters; in late 2012 the United States lifted a ban on visits by New Zealand warships leading to a thawing in tensions.

Heads of defence of one or both states often have joined the annual ministerial meetings, which are supplemented by consultations between the US Combatant Commander Pacific and the Australian Chief of Defence Force. There are also regular civilian and military consultations between the two governments at lower levels.\n\nAnnual meetings to discuss ANZUS defence matters take place between the United States Secretaries of Defense and State and the Australian Ministers of Defence and Foreign Affairs are known by the acronym [[AUSMIN]]. The AUSMIN meeting for 2011 took place in San Francisco in September. The 2012 AUSMIN meeting was in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2011/kr_mr_110914.html |title=AUSMIN 2011, media release, 14 September 2011, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs |publisher=Foreignminister.gov.au |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), ANZUS has no integrated defence structure or dedicated forces. Nevertheless, Australia and the United States conduct a variety of joint activities. These include military exercises ranging from naval and landing exercises at the task-group level to battalion-level special forces training, assigning officers to each other's armed services, and standardising equipment and operational doctrine. The two countries also operate several joint-defence facilities in Australia, mainly ground stations for [[spy satellite]], and [[signals intelligence]] [[espionage]] in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] as part of the [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON]] network.\n\nDuring the 2010s, New Zealand and the US resumed a close relationship, although it is unclear whether the revived partnership falls under the aegis of the 1951 trilateral treaty. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 defined a \"strategic partnership\" between New Zealand and the US, and New Zealand joined the biennial [[Rim of the Pacific]] military exercise off [[Hawaii]] in 2012, for the first time since 1984.

Additionally, the United States wanted to gain Australian and New Zealand approval for a 'soft peace' with Japan.

The treaty bound the signatories to recognise that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of them would endanger the peace and safety of the others. It stated 'The Parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened in the Pacific'.

New Zealand sent transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft, and frigates to the Persian Gulf, as well as a very small number of soldiers, [[New Zealand Special Air Service|SAS]] soldiers, medical and assorted and peace-keeping forces, to Afghanistan in 2001.

Despite these disagreements, the Hawke Labor Government still remained supportive of the ANZUS security treaty. It also did not support its New Zealand counterpart's ban on nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships. Following the ANZUS Split in February 1985, the Australian government also endorsed the Reagan Administration's plans to cancel trilateral military exercises and to postpone the ANZUS foreign ministers conference. However, it still continued to maintain bilateral military ties and continued to share intelligence information with New Zealand.<ref name=\"Ted Carpenter\" /> Unlike New Zealand, Australia continued to allow US warships to visit its ports and to participate in joint military exercises with the United States.<ref>\"US Ships to Visit Sydney\", ''[[The Southland Times]]'', 22 February 1985, p.1</ref><ref>\"US Ships to Visit Australian Ports\", ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 22 February 1985, p.1</ref>\n\n===New Zealand bans nuclear material===\n{{See also|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|Nuclear powered cruisers of the United States Navy}}\n\nIn 1985, the nature of the ANZUS alliance changed significantly. Due to a current of [[anti-nuclear]] sentiment within New Zealand, tension had long been present between ANZUS members as the United States is a declared nuclear power. France, a naval power and a declared nuclear power, had been conducting [[nuclear tests]] on South Pacific Islands. Following the victory of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in [[1984 New Zealand general election|election in 1984]], Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using New Zealand ports or entering [[New Zealand waters]]. Reasons given were the dangers of [[nuclear weapons]], continued [[French nuclear testing]] in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of aggressively confronting the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Amy L.

As this occurred after the government unofficially invited the United States to send a ship, the refusal of access was interpreted by the United States as a deliberate slight.\n\nAccording to opinion polls taken before the 1984 election, only 30 per cent of New Zealanders supported visits by US warships with a clear majority of 58 per cent opposed, and over 66 percent of the population lived in locally declared [[nuclear-free zone]]s.<ref>[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes25 Disarmament and Security Centre: Publications \u2013 Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614183526/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes25 |date=14 June 2006 }}</ref> An opinion poll commissioned by the 1986 Defence Committee of Enquiry confirmed that 92 per cent now opposed nuclear weapons in New Zealand and 69 per cent opposed warship visits; 92 per cent wanted New Zealand to promote [[nuclear disarmament]] through the UN, while 88 per cent supported the promotion of nuclear-free zones.<ref>[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes35 Disarmament and Security Centre: Publications \u2013 Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213164133/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges.html#footnotes35 |date=13 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHowever other polls indicated that the majority of the population would support visits by American warships which might be nuclear armed or powered, if the alternative was that New Zealand would have to withdraw from ANZUS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===United States suspends obligations to New Zealand===\n{{See also|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#New Zealand}}\nAfter consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was \"a friend, but not an ally\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way: Books: David Lange, Michael Gifkins |isbn = 0140145192}}</ref> The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220134021/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |archivedate=2011-02-20|url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |title=The Australian National University |accessdate=2016-03-07}}</ref> David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand.\n\nAn opinion poll in New Zealand in 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm |title=NZ Nationals move closer to US |publisher=Green Left |date=12 June 1991 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202095327/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> showed 54% of those sampled preferred to let the treaty lapse rather than accept visits again by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels.

The failure of Western leaders to condemn this violation of a friendly nation's sovereignty caused a great deal of change in New Zealand's foreign and defence policy,<ref>[[Keith Sinclair]], ''A History of New Zealand'' [[Penguin Books]], New Zealand, 1991</ref> and strengthened domestic opposition to the military application of nuclear technology in any form. New Zealand distanced itself from its traditional ally, the United States, and built relationships with small South Pacific nations, while retaining its good relations with Australia, and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom.<ref>Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way, The Right Honourable [[David Lange]], [[Penguin Books]], [[New Zealand]],1990</ref>\n\nThe suspension of New Zealand in ANZUS has had significant effect on New Zealand\u2013United States relations and on New Zealand domestic policy.

New Zealand committed 191 troops.\n\n===East Timor===\nBetween 1999 and 2003, the armed forces of Australia and New Zealand deployed together in a large scale operation in [[East Timor]], to prevent pro-Indonesian militia from overturning a [[1999 East Timorese independence referendum|vote for independence]] on the island. The United States provided only limited logistical support but {{USS|Mobile Bay|CG-53|6}} provided air defence for the initial entry operation. The operation was taken over by the United Nations.\n\n===Taiwan===\nOne topic that became prominent in the 2000s was the implications in the case of a hypothetical attack by the People's Republic of China against [[Taiwan]], who would likely receive American support. While Australia has strong cultural and economic ties with the United States, it also has an increasingly important trade relationship with China.\n\nIn August 2004, Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] implied in Beijing that the treaty would likely not apply to that situation, but he was quickly corrected by Prime Minister [[John Howard]]. In March 2005, after an official of the People's Republic of China stated that it may be necessary for Australia to reassess the treaty and after China passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] regarding Taiwan, Downer stated that in case of Chinese aggression on Taiwan, the treaty would come into force, but that the treaty would require only consultations with the United States and not necessarily commit Australia to war.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===1985 to present===\n{{Further|New Zealand \u2013 United States relations|Australia \u2013 United States relations|Australia \u2013 New Zealand relations}}\n\nAnnual bilateral meetings between the US Secretary of State and the Australian Foreign Minister replaced annual meetings of the ANZUS Council of Foreign Ministers.

In his book ''Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England'', he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form:\n<blockquote>\nfive minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People\u2019s Garden.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\">{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=79}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOlmsted also commented on the \"perfection\" of the park's gardening:\n<blockquote>\nI cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept with consummate neatness.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nBirkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of [[Sefton Park]], which opened in Liverpool in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Birkenhead Park cricket pavilion 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The gabled cricket pavilion]]\n[[File:Jackson monument, Birkenhead Park front.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackson Memorial drinking fountain]]\nThe [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park. It consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in [[Ionic order|Ionic]] style.  The entrance was designed by [[Lewis Hornblower]], with amendments by [[Joseph Paxton]], the designer of the park.  The park, and its entrance, were opened in 1847.  The Grand Entrance is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].\n\nThe Swiss Bridge, a {{convert|23|ft|2|adj=on}} pedestrian span of stringer construction built in 1847, is unique as being the only [[covered bridge]] of traditional wooden construction (similar to North American and European covered bridges) in the United Kingdom.  It was modelled after similar wooden bridges in Switzerland.\n\nThe Roman Boathouse stands by the lake in the park, the upper storey was originally intended to be a bandstand. It is built in stone and consists of a square pavilion with a segmental arch to the boathouse, above which is an [[arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] and [[pilaster]]ed storey and a [[Pantile (roof material)|pantile]] roof.{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|p=145|ps=}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1292291 |title=PAVILION AND BOAT HOUSE ON BANK OF EAST LAKE, Wirral - 1292291 |website=Historic England |language=en |access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Cricket Pavilion was built in 1849, designed by [[Lewis Hornblower]], in brick with a Welsh [[slate]] roof and has a single storey.
