This story delved into the Awesome Comics universe of characters created by Liefeld, including ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'', and deals with the concept of superheroes being tried for murder. It also features characters created by other [[Image Comics]] creators such as [[Erik Larsen]]'s [[Savage Dragon]].\n\n==Publication==\nThe limited series comprised Judgment Day Alpha (#1), Judgment Day Omega (#2), Final Judgment (#3) and Aftermath.\n\nThe story deals with one member of the superpowered team [[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]] found murdered and the subsequent trial of one of her teammates for the crime. Mark Thompson of Checker Publishing Group perceives ''Judgment Day'' in an introduction for the trade paperback as a spiritual followup to Moore's earlier work ''[[Watchmen]]'' for [[DC Comics]], in that \"if superheroes can commit murder, they can certainly be charged for the crime. And that raises the question: what happens during the trial?\". The main narrative is accompanied by short interludes featuring various characters throughout the history of the Awesome Comics universe, most of which act as analogues for famous literary characters (Sir Edward Conqueror for [[Professor Challenger|George Edward Challenger]], Bram the Bezerk for [[Conan the Barbarian]], Zantar for [[Tarzan]], etc.). Moore would fully utilize the concept of a shared universe of literary characters in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' with [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] and elements of his treatment of Glory were carried over into his [[America's Best Comics]] series ''[[Promethea]]''. The series includes satire on the darkening of the superhero comics industry in the late 1980s to early 1990s, with allusions to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (Alan Moore has made no secret of his dislike for Miller's work). Like his work on ''Supreme'', Alan Moore used ''Judgment Day'' to reject the violent, deconstructive clich\u00e9s of 1990s comics inadvertently caused by his own work on ''Watchmen'', ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' and ''[[Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' and uphold the values of classic superhero comics.\n\nThe series deals with a metacommentary of the notion of retcons to super-hero histories as Alan Moore himself creates a new backstory for the characters of Awesome Comics, to replace the shared universe they left when Rob Liefeld left Image several years earlier.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Mick Tombs/[[Knightsabre]] returns to Youngblood H.Q., drunk and depressed. He intends to make sexual propositions to Leeana Creel/[[Riptide (Image Comics)|Riptide]] at her quarters, but passes out. The next morning, members of Youngblood find Riptide's body, beaten to death in her room, and Knightsabre appears to be the only logical suspect, though he has no memory of it and swears he's innocent. Afraid of media scrutiny over Riptide's suspected murder, [[Shaft (Image Comics)|Shaft]], [[Badrock]] and [[Vogue (Youngblood)|Vogue]] consult [[Savage Dragon]] and [[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]] for help, and are told that Knightsabre's trial will take place on Supreme's floating citadel. Toby King is hired as defense for Knightsabre.\n\nDuring the lengthy trial, after analyzing the memory banks of cybernetic Youngblood member Diehard, King proposes that a mythical book, which Riptide possessed months before her death, was responsible for the events, piecing together many statements about the lengthy history of the book, which was created by [[Hermes]], the god associated with language, who gave it to [[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'s mother, who subsequently buried it in Earth during its creation. The book alters reality when somebody writes upon it, and it has been acquired by many powerful figures over centuries, including the creature who would become Youngblood's Troll and puritan immortal serial killer Deliverance Drue. Drue was defeated when Wild West-era superhero Kid Thunder literally crossed Drue out of existence, with Drue swearing a curse on Thunder's descendants. During a recess, Mr. Graves, administrator for Youngblood, reveals that Knightsabre is his son and that he is disbanding Youngblood due to the media circulation regarding the trial.\n\nKing reveals in the trial that Leanna Creel was the daughter of 1950s superhero Storybook Smith (a descendant of Deliverance Drue) who used the magic book to great lengths to fight crime and gain fame, before the book's robbery and Smith's disappearance. One of Supreme's robot clones enters the trial, having found the book in the home of Marcus Langston/Sentinel, the founder and leader of Team Youngblood. The book eventually came into the hands of Langston after its theft from Storybook Smith, and Langston used it to refashion his life so he became Sentinel and superheroes subsequently became more violent and morally questionable. Prior to her death, Riptide recognised the book and stole it from Sentinel during a Youngblood barbecue at his home. Sentinel deduced that Riptide had stolen it and went to her quarters to retrieve it, killing her during a fight and manipulating the evidence to make Knightsabre look guilty\n\nWhen this is revealed to the court, Sentinel reacts violently, attempting to retrieve the book, but it falls off the citadel and is lost. Sentinel is imprisoned for murdering Riptide and it is learned that he is a descendant of Kid Thunder, whose kin Deliverance Drue swore a curse against before his defeat. As Youngblood disbands, the Allied Supermen of America (an analogue for the [[Justice League of America]]) are inspired by the event to reform, as the magical book finds itself in the hands of a homeless young woman.\n\n==Collected editions==\nThe limited series was later collected as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] by [[Checker Book Publishing Group]] in 2003 (150 pages, {{ISBN|0-9741664-5-6}}).\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{gcdb series|id=5924|title=''Judgment Day''}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=17808|title=''Judgment Day''}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://scarlettracesannotations.googlepages.com/judgementday Annotations to the comic book references in Judgement Day]\n\n{{Youngblood|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Extreme Studios|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Alan Moore}}\n\n[[Category:1997 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Comics by Alan Moore]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|other uses of the name in comics|Judgement Day (comics)}}\n{{Infobox comic book title\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n|title               = Judgment Day\n|image               = <!-- filename format only -->\n|imagesize           = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption             =\n|schedule            =\n|format              = [[Limited series (comics)|Mini-series]]\n|limited             = y\n|Superhero           = y\n|publisher           = [[Awesome Comics]]\n|date                = June 1997 - October 1997\n|issues              = 3\n|main_char_team      = \n|writers             = [[Alan Moore]]\n|artists             = [[Rob Liefeld]], <br/> [[Gil Kane]]\n|pencillers          = [[Keith Giffen]]<br />[[Gil Kane]]<br />[[Rob Liefeld]]<br />[[Stephen Platt (comics)|Stephen Platt]]\n|inkers              =\n|letterers           =\n|colorists           =\n|editors             =\n|creative_team_month =\n|creative_team_year  =\n|creators            =\n|TPB                 = Judgment Day\n|ISBN                = 0-9741664-5-6\n|subcat              = Awesome Comics\n|sort                = \n}}\n'''''Judgment Day''''' was a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by [[Awesome Comics]] from June to October 1997 written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Rob Liefeld]], with additional art by [[Gil Kane]].

Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in 1900\u2019s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational  & its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]].  In 1970\u2019s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy & education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. Role of president & secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature & Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school & one inter high school in our village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education. At present, there is a middle and high school in Kutri named Middle School and High School, Kutri located in northern and southern part of village respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseidc.in/secondary_school.php |title= Higher Secondary School List SL.

Once again in 2020\u2019s Villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation & creating quiz & competition classes amongst students  to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists & motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar.

Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in 1900\u2019s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational  & its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]].  In 1970\u2019s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy & education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. Role of president & secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature & Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school & one inter high school in our village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education. At present, there is a middle and high school in Kutri named Middle School and High School, Kutri located in northern and southern part of village respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseidc.in/secondary_school.php |title= Higher Secondary School List SL.

Once again in 2020\u2019s Villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation & creating quiz & competition classes amongst students  to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists & motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar. Rakesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Prof. Baliram, sanjeev, Sonu etc took lead to move forward this education awareness under the supervision of Maa Kali Sewa Sanstahan President Shri Ram Avtar Sharma, Secretary, Shri Ram Lakhan Sharma & Treasurer Shri Rajendra Singh.

The IRSS cadre is responsible for [[forecasting]], [[planning]], [[procurement]] of material, [[logistics]]  management, and [[warehousing]] of Indian Railway's assets.  It is also responsible for giving material support to production of [[railway coach]]s, [[locomotives]], and [[railway wagons]]. Realization of revenue by selling of scrap is another major function of the Stores Department. This is done by means of auctions, tender sale, and staff sales.\n\n==Evolution of purchase function in Indian Railways==\nAt the time of independence, Indian Railways was running primarily on [[steam locomotives]]. Most of the components required for steam locomotives were made in workshops, and the components which were to be purchased, were very few. The stores requirements for track, signaling, C&W and other general items were also inadequate.  As, at that time, the industrialization of country had just started, a substantial number of stores were to be imported mainly through India Supply Mission. The function of the stores department, at that time, was limited and mainly centered on storekeeping.\n\nHowever, with the start of dieselisation in 1950s and speeding up of electrification from 1960s, the face of railways started changing.  Electric locomotives, compared to steam locomotives, required more items that were sophisticated and had to be purchased. It was mainly with dieselisation and electrification, that the purchase function of railways started evolving though other changing areas, e.g. signaling, production of coaches, track laying, and maintenance activity.  Apart from more number of purchase items, the issues like quality and reliability of items and the firms who were supplying them also became relevant as diesel and electric locomotives required sophisticated items for which credentials and capabilities of vendors needed to be pre-assessed.  Activity of approval and registration of firms thus started. As the railway system was expanding, the funds became scarce and there was an urgent need to keep inventories at optimum levels so that capital could be used elsewhere, making inventory control important. Similarly the scrap sales function also became more and more important over the years.\n\nPurchasing and its allied activities became complex as the traffic and train services increased in number and size.  Purchase activity, which was clerical in nature in earlier days, had to respond to the needs of time become professional.  The 1980s and 1990s saw more types of rolling stocks and improved maintenance practices.  The railway network as measured by track km remained more or less the same, the increase in traffic and customer expectation put severe constraints on all the resources like track, rolling stock sheds, and workshops.  Less time became available for maintenance.  From the mid 1990s, safe running of trains emerged as an important issue and compared to previous decades, and more items became essential for safe operation of trains. All these issues put severe strain on railways purchasing system.\n\nOver the years, Indian Railways' purchases have gone manifold both in terms of value and number of items.  The technical, industrial, and commercial scenario of the country has also changed significantly.  There are now more standards, specifications, and accrediting bodies, and more central, state and local laws. Purchasing in today's world is done in a complex environment.\n\nThe members of the IRSS on the Indian Railways are the procurement and logistics specialists responsible for procurement of various goods and services to the tune of Rs. 25000 Crores annually, and disposal of scrap to the tune of Rs. 3000 Crores per annum in the form of auction and sale of electric and diesel locomotives, old coaches and wagons, and old bridge structures along with the rails released from the gauge conversion activities. (These figures are from the latest IR-Yearbook)\n\nThey also manage huge warehouses attached with the major coaching and wagon workshops as well as the electric and diesel locomotive sheds.\n\nThey are the logistics managers for transportation of material through the roadways.\n\n==Organization==\nThe department is organized in three tiers. The top tier is at the Railway Board level, the second tier at the Zonal Railway level and the third tier at the divisional or the district level.\n\nAt the apex level, this department is headed by Member Materials Management who represents the department at the Railway Board level and is ex officio Secretary to the Government of India.  Member Materials Management is in turn assisted by Additional Member (Railway Stores), Principal Executive Directors, Executive Directors and Directors.\n\nAt the zonal levels, the principal head of the department is the Principal Chief Materials Manager(PCMM). The PCMM is assisted by  Chief Materials Managers(CMMs). These CMMs in turn have various Dy. Chief Materials Managers, and in turn, they are assisted by the Senior Materials Managers and the Assistant Materials Managers.  The Stores department manages about 200 warehouses that feed into the repair workshops and maintenance sheds.  The Warehouses called depots headed by a Depot Officer.  Depots attached to workshops are headed by Dy. CMMs, and electric and diesel locomotive sheds headed by SMMs. These depots directly reports to PCMM Division headed by Sr. DMMs who report to Divisional Railway Managers.  Sr. DMMs are responsible for material management at divisional level by catering needs to others branches of divisions.  They are responsible for coordination of scrap arising out of division in close association with the Engineering Department.  Sr. DMMs also do uniform management for various grades of running staff such as guards, TTE, station masters.\n\n==Objectives of the department for the coming years==\nRecent policy decisions have been made by the Ministry of Railways for expanding and improving the conditions of railway infrastructure, amenities on trains, railway stations, and other railway premises for passengers and other railway users.  As a result, phenomenal growth has taken place in all the activities including those of the Stores department. Since economic liberalization started in early 1990s, the pace of growth has increased substantially and Indian Railways has set ambitious targets for the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]].\n\nScientific materials and supply chain management have emerged in recent years as important managerial functions.  A systematic application of the tools and techniques of materials management can achieve considerable saving in costs and increase in productivity.  No management can afford to ignore these concepts and techniques in an environment marked by liberalization, globalization, enhanced competition, and rapid progress in technology, particularly in the areas of automation and computerization.\n\nThe objective is to increasingly apply the modern concepts related to integrated materials management, strategic and operational aspects of outsourcing and procurement, the interface of materials management and supply chain management. The objective is also to adopt the latest techniques of cost control and optimization by leveraging information technology tools for development and implementation of an efficient materials management system in the organization. It is needless to say that all is to be done in public procurement platforms in most economic manner.\n\nThe technical, industrial and commercial scenario of the country has also changed significantly. There are now more number of standards, specifications, accrediting bodies and also more central, state and local laws. Even organizations much smaller in size and scope than Railways appoint persons expert in techno-commercial areas like taxation, port clearance, law and accountancy. The officers manning the cadre will be encouraged to take special interest and become specialist in one of the areas of scientific materials management, some of which are given below-\n\n* Strategic [[procurement]] management\n* International purchasing\n* [[Inventory management]] \u2013 designing and implementing inventory systems\n* [[Logistics management]]\n* [[Management information system]]\n* Financial aspects of materials management\n* Sales and [[Auction]] management\n* [[Value engineering]]\n\nThe market in India has also undergone tremendous change ever since the liberalization process was initiated in early 1990s.  The boundaries between the domestic and global market have become thin and transparent.  A number of global players and multi-nationals have entered the Indian market and are keen to join hands with Indian Railways.  In order to take advantage of market conditions, Indian Railways has to make major changes in their rules, procedures, and methodology of procurement, and the methodology of disposal of non-performing assets and unserviceable materials.  For example, green procurement, [[e-procurement]], [[e-payments]], [[reverse auction]], and eco-friendly disposal systems have to be not only introduced early but implemented with speed and on a sustainable basis.\n\nE-Procurement: since 2009, Indian Railways Stores Service achieved the distinction of going 100% digital on tendering and procurement through web based online process using PKI and digital signatures completing all 26 railway units (both zonal & P.U.s). This is the biggest web-based procurement portal in Asia using single window function for all procurements by Indian Railways, crossing over two Lakh online tenders through fully secured website www.ireps.gov.in .\nE-Auction: IRSS successfully achieved & adopted Online E-Auction process since May 2013, crossing E-Auction Revenue over 1000 CR using full secured single window e-Auction process, providing online net banking and payment, enabling purchasers across India to participate online.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Public Services of India}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stores Service}}\n[[Category:Indian Engineering Services]]\n[[Category:Indian Railways Services]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Prestigious Group of the Government of India}}\n{{mi|{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{original research|date=July 2019}}\n{{primary|date=July 2019}}}}\nThe '''Indian Railways Stores Service (IRSS)''' is a central service of the [[Government of India]].

Montana's popular Democratic governor, [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]], is term-limited, but his lieutenant governor is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, making the race competitive in a state [[Donald Trump]] won by 20 points in 2016. New Hampshire is a Democratic leaning state with a Republican governor, [[Chris Sununu]], and seeing as Democrats made major gains in the state in 2018, Sununu faces a tough reelection, despite being relatively popular. North Carolina is a Republican-leaning state with a Democratic governor, [[Roy Cooper]], meaning that Cooper faces a tough reelection as well. [[Vermont]] is the only other race that could become competitive, however, Republican incumbent [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phill Scott]] is ranked one of the most popular governors in the [[United States]] and there are no formidable Democratic challengers. The gubernatorial races in [[Delaware]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] are seen as safe for Democrats, while [[Indiana]], [[Missouri]], [[North Dakota]], [[Utah]], and [[West Virginia]] are seen as safe for Republicans.\n\nSeveral sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the [[incumbent]] (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage, and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n!

Montana's popular Democratic governor, [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]], is term-limited, but his lieutenant governor is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, making the race competitive in a state [[Donald Trump]] won by 20 points in 2016. New Hampshire is a Democratic leaning state with a Republican governor, [[Chris Sununu]], and seeing as Democrats made major gains in the state in 2018, Sununu faces a tough reelection, despite being relatively popular. North Carolina is a Republican-leaning state with a Democratic governor, [[Roy Cooper]], meaning that Cooper faces a tough reelection as well. [[Vermont]] is the only other race that could become competitive, however, Republican incumbent [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phill Scott]] is ranked one of the most popular governors in the [[United States]] and there are no formidable Democratic challengers. The gubernatorial races in [[Delaware]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] are seen as safe for Democrats, while [[Indiana]], [[Missouri]], [[North Dakota]], [[Utah]], and [[West Virginia]] are seen as safe for Republicans.\n\nSeveral sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the [[incumbent]] (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage, and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n!

Under the government's \"''Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant''\", designated sites for Travellers' use are provided by councils, and funds are made available to local authorities for the construction of new sites and maintenance and extension of existing sites.\n\nHowever, Travellers make frequent use of other, non-authorised sites.  These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex. The Travellers claim that there is an under-provision of authorised sites. The Gypsy Council estimates an under-provision amounts to insufficient sites for 3,500 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4213875.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThe passing of the [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]], for some time, safeguarded their right to a site, but the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] repealed part II of the 1968 act, removing the duty on local authorities in the UK to provide sites for Travellers and giving them the power to close down existing sites.

A 1997 American film, ''[[Traveller (1997 film)|Traveller]]'', starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Mark Wahlberg]], also explored the Travellers in America.

Many families choose not to reveal the specifics of their finances, but when explained it is very difficult to detect any sort of pattern or regular trend of monthly or weekly income.

Under the government's \"''Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant''\", designated sites for Travellers' use are provided by councils, and funds are made available to local authorities for the construction of new sites and maintenance and extension of existing sites.\n\nHowever, Travellers make frequent use of other, non-authorised sites.  These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex. The Travellers claim that there is an under-provision of authorised sites. The Gypsy Council estimates an under-provision amounts to insufficient sites for 3,500 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4213875.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThe passing of the [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]], for some time, safeguarded their right to a site, but the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] repealed part II of the 1968 act, removing the duty on local authorities in the UK to provide sites for Travellers and giving them the power to close down existing sites.

Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system.\n\nThe film, set in the early 1950s, is based on [[Donn Pearce]]'s 1965 [[Cool Hand Luke (novel)|novel of the same name]]. Pearce sold the story to [[Warner Bros.]], who then hired him to write the script. Due to Pearce's lack of film experience, the studio added [[Frank Pierson]] to rework the screenplay. Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the \"tough, honest\" script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'', Newman's earlier film of 1967. The film has been cited by [[Roger Ebert]] as an anti-establishment film which was shot during the time of emerging popular opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].  Newman's character, Lucas Jackson, is described (by the notorious \"Captain\" upon his arrival at the prison), as a \"free spirit,\" whose personal record (read out loud because of its unusual details) indicates a man who started well in the U.S. Army\u2014receiving medals for bravery in \"the war\"\u2014rose to the rank of sergeant, yet was discharged as a \"buck\" private.\n\nLuke does not question his physical incarceration, and initially has no thought of escape. But his spirit is not, like that of his fellow inmates, imprisoned.  This free thinking is, from the outset, noticed by the institution, its functionaries (the guards), and especially its leaders.  Their response is a mixture of both fear and loathing.  So they retaliate against Luke through both physical and psychological punishment. His influence on his prison mates and the torture that he endures is compared to that of [[Jesus]], and Christian symbolism is used throughout the film, culminating in a photograph superimposed over crossroads at the end of the film in comparison to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Filming took place within California's [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|San Joaquin River Delta]] region; the set, imitating a prison farm in the [[Deep South]], was based on photographs and measurements made by a crew sent to Road Prison in [[Gainesville, Florida]] by the filmmakers.\n\nUpon its release, ''Cool Hand Luke'' received favorable reviews and became a box-office success. The film cemented Newman's status as one of the era's top box-office actors, while the film was described as the \"touchstone of an era.\" Newman was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], George Kennedy won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]], and the score by [[Lalo Schifrin]] was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. In 2005, the [[United States Library of Congress]] selected it for the [[National Film Registry]], considering it to be  \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]] on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The quotation used by the prison warden ([[Strother Martin]]) in the film, which begins with \"What we've got here is failure to communicate,\" was listed at No. 11 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|list]] of the 100 most memorable movie lines.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1947, decorated war veteran Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson ([[Paul Newman]]), is arrested for cutting [[parking meter]]s off their poles one drunken night. He is sentenced to two years in prison and sent to a Florida prison [[chain gang]] run by a stern warden, the Captain ([[Strother Martin]]), and a taciturn rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey ([[Morgan Woodward]]), whose eyes are always covered by a pair of mirrored sunglasses. Carr ([[Clifton James]]) the [[Trustee#Correctional institution usage|floorwalker]], tells the rules to the new set of prisoners. Violations result in a night in \"the box\", a small square room with limited air and very little room to move.\n\nLuke refuses to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader, Dragline ([[George Kennedy]]). When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline refuses to continue the fight but Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws the attention of the guards. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing. Luke comments that \"sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand\", prompting Dragline to nickname him \"Cool Hand Luke\".\n\n[[File:Cool Hand Luke 2.jpg|thumb|left|Luke and the chain gang finish paving the road|270px]]\nAfter a visit from his sick mother, Arletta ([[Jo Van Fleet]]), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He continually confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.\n\nOne day, Luke picks up a deadly [[rattlesnake]] from the grassy ditch and holds it up for Boss Godfrey to shoot with his rifle. Luke tosses the snake to the boss as a joke, before he hands him his walking cane. Dragline advises Luke to be more careful about his actions pertaining to the \"man with no eyes.\" A rainstorm causes everyone to prematurely end their work. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing him. On that same evening, Luke receives a letter stating that his mother has died.\n\nThe Captain anticipates that Luke might attempt to escape in order to attend his mother's funeral and has him locked in the box. After being released from the box, Luke is told to forget about his mother now that her burial is completed but he becomes determined to escape. Under the cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but one of the [[bloodhound]]s sent after him dies from heat and overexertion. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. And I don't like it any more than you men.\"\n\nA short time later, Luke escapes again by deceiving the guards while taking a break to urinate, and removes his shackles with an axe at a nearby house. He spreads [[curry powder]] and chili powder across the ground to keep the guard dogs from following his scent. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals it to be a fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.\n\nAs further punishment for his escape, he is forced to repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and is then beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from the windows of the bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.\n\n[[File:Cool Hand Luke 3.jpg|thumb|250px|Luke defies the authorities for the last time]]\nWorking on the chain gang again, seemingly broken, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the disappointed prisoners, he runs to one of the trucks to take Boss Godfrey's rifle to him. After Boss Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke is ordered to take the turtle to the truck but steals the dump truck and the keys to the other trucks.  In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape.  After abandoning the truck Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline reluctantly agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully.  Instead of submitting, Luke opens a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the Captain's earlier speech (\"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\"). He is shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Boss Godfrey and strangles him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. While Luke is loaded into the Captain's car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live. Against the protests of the local police, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital, ensuring that he will not survive the trip. As the Captain's car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. Dragline is now wearing [[leg iron]]s, and there is a new Walking Boss. As the camera zooms out, the torn photograph of Luke grinning with the two women has been taped back together and is superimposed on a bird's eye view of the cross-shaped road junction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Paul Newman]] as Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson\n*[[George Kennedy]] as Dragline\n*[[Strother Martin]] as the Captain\n*[[Jo Van Fleet]] as Luke's mother, Arletta\n*[[Joy Harmon]] as the Girl (Lucille)\n*[[Morgan Woodward]] as Boss Godfrey\n*[[Luke Askew]] as Boss Paul\n*[[Robert Donner]] as Boss Shorty\n*[[Clifton James]] as Carr the floor walker\n*[[John McLiam]] as Boss Keen\n*Andre Trottier as Boss Popler\n*[[Charles Tyner]] as Boss Higgins\n*[[J.D.

The dialogue is featured with a familiar backdrop: In ''Cool Hand Luke'', a leggy blonde washes a car while the men look on lustily; in the scene in ''The Sandlot'', a leggy blonde applies sunblock while young boys look on admiringly.\n\nIn the pilot for the television series ''[[Cheers]]'', Diane's fiance Sumner Sloan nominates ''Cool Hand Luke'' as the world's sweatiest movie.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1967]]\n*[[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes]]\n*[[Prisoner abuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Portal|United States|Film|Law|1960s}}\n===Sources===\n{{Div col}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|author=AFI|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/handv.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|publisher=American Film Institute|year=2003|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|author=AFI|url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/quotes.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|publisher=American Film Institute|year=2005|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=AFI|url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/cheers.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers|publisher=American Film Institute|year=2007|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Allora, Jennifer |author2=Ruf, Beatrix |author3=Calzadilla, Guillermo |year=2009|title=Allora & Calzadilla|publisher=JRP Ringier|isbn=978-3-03764-027-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Borden|first=Marian Edelman|title=Paul Newman: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7Q0N4mfVfkC&pg=PA45|date=November 1, 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38310-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Brode, Douglas|year=1990|title=The films of the sixties|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8065-0798-9|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsofsixties00brod}}\n* {{cite book|author=Brown, Peter|publisher=Arlington House|year=1981|title=The real Oscar: the story behind the Academy Awards|isbn=978-0-87000-498-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Burr, Sherri|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|title=Entertainment law in a nutshell|isbn=978-0-314-17176-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Charlotte, Susan|year=1993|publisher=Monumentum Books, LLC|title=Creativity: Conversations With 28 Who Excel|isbn=978-1-879094-11-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Clooney|first=Ron|title=Mr. Mojo Risin' (Ain't Dead)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5oFcGYFYEC&pg=PA231|year=2011|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-84876-757-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|author=Crowther, Bosley|year=1967|title=Movie Review: 'Cool Hand Luke'|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF1738E260BC4A53DFB767838C679EDE|work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 27, 2013|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Debolt, Abbe |author2=Baugess, James |year=2011|title=Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=978-0-313-32944-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=DeMar|first=Carol|title=It Takes a Backbone to Raise Terrific Kids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9-cFB52Lp4C&pg=PA87|publisher=American Vision|isbn=978-1-60702-167-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=DiLeo, John|year=2010|title=Tennessee Williams and Company: His Essential Screen Actors|publisher=Hansen Publishing Group, LLC|isbn=978-1-60182-425-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Dimare, Phillip|year=2011|title=Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=978-1-59884-297-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Doberman, Matthew|title=Cool Hand Luke|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/cool-hand-luke-v10957/review|year=2009|work=Allmovie|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=August 27, 2013|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Eagan, Daniel|year=2010|title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-2977-3|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americasfilmlega0000eaga}}\n* {{cite book|author=Ebert, Roger|year=2010|title=The Great Movies III|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-18211-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Empire Magazine staff|year=2005|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=14336|title=Cool Hand Luke|work=Empire|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media|accessdate=August 27, 2013|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Empire Magazine staff 2|year=2005|url= http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=53 |title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&#124; 53.

Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system.\n\nThe film, set in the early 1950s, is based on [[Donn Pearce]]'s 1965 [[Cool Hand Luke (novel)|novel of the same name]]. Pearce sold the story to [[Warner Bros.]], who then hired him to write the script. Due to Pearce's lack of film experience, the studio added [[Frank Pierson]] to rework the screenplay. Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the \"tough, honest\" script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'', Newman's earlier film of 1967. The film has been cited by [[Roger Ebert]] as an anti-establishment film which was shot during the time of emerging popular opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].  Newman's character, Lucas Jackson, is described (by the notorious \"Captain\" upon his arrival at the prison), as a \"free spirit,\" whose personal record (read out loud because of its unusual details) indicates a man who started well in the U.S. Army\u2014receiving medals for bravery in \"the war\"\u2014rose to the rank of sergeant, yet was discharged as a \"buck\" private.\n\nLuke does not question his physical incarceration, and initially has no thought of escape. But his spirit is not, like that of his fellow inmates, imprisoned.  This free thinking is, from the outset, noticed by the institution, its functionaries (the guards), and especially its leaders.  Their response is a mixture of both fear and loathing.  So they retaliate against Luke through both physical and psychological punishment. His influence on his prison mates and the torture that he endures is compared to that of [[Jesus]], and Christian symbolism is used throughout the film, culminating in a photograph superimposed over crossroads at the end of the film in comparison to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Filming took place within California's [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|San Joaquin River Delta]] region; the set, imitating a prison farm in the [[Deep South]], was based on photographs and measurements made by a crew sent to Road Prison in [[Gainesville, Florida]] by the filmmakers.\n\nUpon its release, ''Cool Hand Luke'' received favorable reviews and became a box-office success. The film cemented Newman's status as one of the era's top box-office actors, while the film was described as the \"touchstone of an era.\" Newman was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], George Kennedy won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]], and the score by [[Lalo Schifrin]] was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. In 2005, the [[United States Library of Congress]] selected it for the [[National Film Registry]], considering it to be  \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]] on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The quotation used by the prison warden ([[Strother Martin]]) in the film, which begins with \"What we've got here is failure to communicate,\" was listed at No. 11 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|list]] of the 100 most memorable movie lines.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1947, decorated war veteran Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson ([[Paul Newman]]), is arrested for cutting [[parking meter]]s off their poles one drunken night. He is sentenced to two years in prison and sent to a Florida prison [[chain gang]] run by a stern warden, the Captain ([[Strother Martin]]), and a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey ([[Morgan Woodward]]), whose eyes are always covered by a pair of mirrored sunglasses. Carr ([[Clifton James]]) the [[Trustee#Correctional institution usage|floorwalker]], tells the rules to the new set of prisoners. Violations result in a night in \"the box\", a small square room with limited air and very little room to move.\n\nLuke refuses to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader, Dragline ([[George Kennedy]]). When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline refuses to continue the fight but Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws the attention of the guards. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing. Luke comments that \"sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand\", prompting Dragline to nickname him \"Cool Hand Luke\".\n\n[[File:Cool Hand Luke 2.jpg|thumb|left|Luke and the chain gang finish paving the road|270px]]\nAfter a visit from his sick mother, Arletta ([[Jo Van Fleet]]), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He continually confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.\n\nOne day, Luke picks up a deadly [[rattlesnake]] from the grassy ditch and holds it up for Boss Godfrey to shoot with his rifle. Luke tosses the snake to the boss as a joke, before he hands him his walking cane. Dragline advises Luke to be more careful about his actions pertaining to the \"man with no eyes.\" A rainstorm causes everyone to prematurely end their work. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing him. On that same evening, Luke receives a letter stating that his mother has died.\n\nThe Captain anticipates that Luke might attempt to escape in order to attend his mother's funeral and has him locked in the box. After being released from the box, Luke is told to forget about his mother now that her burial is completed but he becomes determined to escape. Under the cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but one of the [[bloodhound]]s sent after him dies from heat and overexertion. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. And I don't like it any more than you men.\"\n\nA short time later, Luke escapes again by deceiving the guards while taking a break to urinate, and removes his shackles with an axe at a nearby house. He spreads [[curry powder]] and chili powder across the ground to keep the guard dogs from following his scent. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals it to be a fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.\n\nAs further punishment for his escape, he is forced to repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and is then beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from the windows of the bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.\n\n[[File:Cool Hand Luke 3.jpg|thumb|250px|Luke defies the authorities for the last time]]\nWorking on the chain gang again, seemingly broken, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the disappointed prisoners, he runs to one of the trucks to take Boss Godfrey's rifle to him. After Boss Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke is ordered to take the turtle to the truck but steals the dump truck and the keys to the other trucks.  In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape.  After abandoning the truck Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline reluctantly agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully.  Instead of submitting, Luke opens a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the Captain's earlier speech (\"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\"). He is shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Boss Godfrey and strangles him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. While Luke is loaded into the Captain's car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live. Against the protests of the local police, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital, ensuring that he will not survive the trip. As the Captain's car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot.

He sold the story to [[Warner Bros.]] for US$80,000 and received another US$15,000 to write the screenplay.{{sfn|Eagan, Daniel|p=628|2010}} After working in television for over a decade, Rosenberg chose it to make it his directorial debut in cinema. He took the idea to Jalem Productions, owned by Jack Lemmon.{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2009|p=203}} Since Pearce had no experience writing screenplays, his draft was reworked by Frank Pierson. [[Conrad Hall]] was hired as the cinematographer,{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2009|p=204}} while Paul Newman's brother, Arthur, was hired as the unit production manager.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}} Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the \"tough, honest\" script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'', Newman's earlier film of 1967.{{Sfn|Borden|2010|p=45}}  Director Stuart Rosenberg altered the original ending in the script, adding \"an upbeat ending that would reprise the protagonist's (and Paul Newman's) trademark smile.\"{{sfn|Grant|2008|p=178}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Paul Newman]]'s character, Luke, is a decorated war veteran who is sentenced to serve two years in a Florida rural prison. He constantly defies the authorities of the facility, becoming a leader among the prisoners, as well as escaping multiple times.{{sfn|Dimare, Phillip|p={{google books|0qUJ-JuSPdQC|page=106}} -  {{google books|0qUJ-JuSPdQC|page=107}}|2011}} While the script was being developed, the leading role was initially considered for [[Jack Lemmon]] or [[Telly Savalas]]. Newman asked to play the leading role after hearing about the project. In order to develop his character, he traveled to [[West Virginia]], where he recorded local accents and surveyed people's behavior.{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2009|p=204}} [[George Kennedy]] turned in an Academy Award-winning performance as the leader of the prisoners, Dragline, who fights Luke, and comes to respect him.{{sfn|Debolt, Abbe; Baugess, James|p=152|2011}} During the nomination process, worried about the box office success of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' and ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', Kennedy invested US$5,000 in trade advertising to promote himself. Kennedy later stated that thanks to the award his salary was \"multiplied by ten the minute (he) won,\" also adding \"the happiest part was that I didn't have to play only villains anymore.\"{{sfn|Brown, Peter|1981|p=190}}\n\n[[Strother Martin]], known for his appearances in westerns,{{sfn|McKay, James|p=178|2010}} was cast as the Captain, a prison warden who is depicted as a cruel and insensitive leader, severely punishing Luke for his escapes.{{sfn|Langman, Larry; Ebner, David|p=177|2001}}  The role of Luke's dying mother, Arletta, who visits him in prison, was passed to [[Jo Van Fleet]] after it was rejected by [[Bette Davis]].{{sfn|Reed, John Shelton|p=196|2003}} [[Morgan Woodward]] was cast as Boss Godfrey, a laconic, cruel and remorseless prison officer who Woodward described as a \"walking [[Mephistopheles]].\"{{sfn|Burr, Sherri|2007|p=19}} He was dubbed \"the man with no eyes\" by the inmates for his mirrored sunglasses.{{sfn|Ebert, Roger|p=102|2010}} The blonde [[Joy Harmon]] was cast for the scene where she teases the prisoners in washing her car after her manager, Leon Lance, contacted the producers. She auditioned in front of Rosenberg and Newman wearing a bikini, without speaking.{{sfn|Lisanti, Tom|p=114|2000}}\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place on the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|San Joaquin River Delta]].{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}} The set, imitating a southern prison farm, was built in [[Stockton, California]].{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2009|p=204}} The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in [[Tavares, Florida]], where Pearce had served his time, to take photographs and measurements.{{sfn|Florida Department of Corrections|2010}} The structures that were built in Stockton included barracks, a mess hall, the warden's quarters, a guard shack and dog kennels. The trees on the set were decorated with [[spanish moss]] that the producers took to the area.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}} The construction soon attracted the attention of a county building inspector who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it \"condemned for code violations.\"{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2009|p=204}} The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters was filmed in [[Lodi, California]].{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}} Meanwhile, the scene in which Luke is chased by [[bloodhound]]s and other exteriors were shot in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the [[Florida Department of Corrections]].{{sfn|Florida Department of Corrections|2010}}\n\nRosenberg wanted the cast to internalize life on a chain gang and banned the presence of wives on set. After Joy Harmon arrived on location, she remained for two days in her hotel room, and wasn't seen by the rest of the cast until shooting commenced.{{sfn|Lisanti, Tom|p=115, 116|2000}} Despite the director's intentions, the scene was ultimately filmed separately.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}}  Rosenberg instructed an unaware Harmon of the different movements and expressions he wanted.{{sfn|Lisanti, Tom|p=115, 116|2000}} Originally planned to be shot in half a day, Harmon's scene took three. For the part of the scene featuring the chain gang, Rosenberg substituted a teenage cheerleader, who wore an overcoat.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2010}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|Cool Hand Luke (soundtrack)}}\nThe Academy Award nominated [[Film score|original score]] was composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], who created tunes with a background in popular music and jazz.{{sfn|MacDonald, Laurence|p=228|2013}} While some of the tracks include the use of guitars, banjos and harmonicas, others include trumpets, violins, flutes and piano.{{sfn|MacDonald, Laurence|p=230|2013}}\n\nAn edited version of the musical cue from the ''Tar Sequence'' (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) has been used for years as the theme music for local television stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.{{sfn|Allora, Jennifer; Ruf, Beatrix; Calzadilla, Guillermo|p=142|2009}}\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Christian imagery===\nPierson included in his draft explicit religious symbolism.{{sfn|Eagan, Daniel|p=628|2010}} The film contains several elements based on Christian themes, including the concept of [[Saint Luke|Luke as a Saint]] who wins over the crowds and is ultimately sacrificed.{{sfn|Reinhartz, Adele|p= 69 - 72|2012}} Newman's character of Luke is portrayed as a \"Jesus-like redeemer figure.\"{{sfn|Greenspoon|Beau|Hamm|2000|p=131}} After winning the egg-eating bet, Luke lies exhausted on the table in the position of Jesus as depicted on [[crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]], hands outstretched, feet folded over each other. After learning about the death of his mother, Luke sings \"[[Plastic Jesus (song)|Plastic Jesus]].\"{{sfn|Fairbanks, Brian|p=95|2005}} Greg Garrett also compares Luke to Jesus, in that like Jesus, he was not physically threatening to society because of his actions, and like Jesus' crucifixion, his punishment was \"out of all proportion.\"{{sfn|Garrett, Gregg|p=36 - 40|2007}}\n\nLuke challenges God during the rainstorm on the road, telling him to do anything to him. Later, while he is digging and filling trenches and confronted by the guards, the inmate Tramp ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) performs the spiritual \"[[Ain't No Grave|No Grave Gonna Keep my Body Down]].\"{{sfn|Garrett, Gregg|p=36 - 40|2007}} Toward the end of the film, Luke speaks to God, evoking the conversation between God and Jesus at the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], depicted in the [[Gospel of Luke]].{{sfn|Garrett, Gregg|p=36 - 40|2007}} Following Luke's talk, the film depicts Dragline as a [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], who delivers Luke to the authorities, trying to convince him to surrender.{{sfn|May, John|p=57|2001}} In the final scene, Dragline eulogizes Luke. He explains that despite Luke's death, his actions succeeded in defeating the system.{{sfn|Reinhartz, Adele|p= 69 - 72|2012}} The closing shot shows inmates working on crossroads from far above, such that the intersection is in the shape of the cross. Superimposed on this is the repaired photo Luke took during his second escape, the distinct creases of which also form the shape of the cross.{{sfn|Fairbanks, Brian|p=95|2005}}{{sfn|Hook, Sue Vander|p=56|2010}}\n\n===Use of traffic signs and signals===\nDifferent traffic signs are used throughout the film, complementing the actions of the characters during the scenes. At the beginning, while Luke cuts the heads off the parking meters, the word \"Violation\" appears. [[Stop sign]]s are also seen. Instances include the road-paving scene and the last scene, where the road meets at a cross section. [[Traffic light]]s turn from green to red in the background at the time Luke is arrested, while at the end, when he is fatally wounded, a green light in the background turns to red.{{sfn|Jarvis, Brian|2004|p=184\u2013187}}\n\n===\"Failure to communicate\"===\n[[File:Failure to Communicate - 'Cool Hand Luke'.jpg|thumb|After beating Luke to the ground, the Captain delivers the statement.

To explain its origin, he created a [[backstory]] that was included in the stage directions. Pierson explained that in order to advance in the Florida prison system, officers had to take [[criminology]] and [[penology]] courses at the state university, showing how the warden might know such words.{{sfn|Charlotte, Susan|p=308|1993}} Strother Martin later clarified that he felt the line was the kind that his character would very likely have heard or read from some \"pointy-headed intellectuals\" who had begun to infiltrate his character's world under the general [[rubric]] of a new, enlightened approach to incarceration.{{sfn|Brode, Douglas|1990|p=195}} Some authors believe that the quotation was a metaphor for the ongoing Vietnam War conflict which was taking place during the filming,{{sfn|Nolte|2003|p=285}} and others have applied it towards corporations and even teenagers.{{sfn|DeMar|p=87}} The quotation was listed at number 11 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|list]] of the 100 most memorable movie lines.{{sfn|AFI|2005}}\n\n[[Zero Mostel]] paraphrases the line in ''[[The Great Bank Robbery (1969 film)|The Great Bank Robbery]]'' (1969). When [[Strother Martin]] hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on April 19, 1980, he played the strict owner of a language camp for children, parodying his ''Cool Hand Luke'' role. He paraphrased his line from the movie as, \"What we have here is failure to communicate BI-LINGUALLY!\" An audio sample of the line is included in the [[Guns N' Roses]] songs \"[[Civil War (song)|Civil War]]\" and \"[[Madagascar (song)|Madagascar]]\".{{sfn|Rasmussen, Eric|1991|p=74}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Cool Hand Luke'' opened on November 1, 1967, at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in New York City.

He believed that the film was a product of its time and that no major film company would be interested in producing a film of such \"physical punishment, psychological cruelty, hopelessness and equal parts of sadism and masochism\" today. He praised the cinematography, capturing the \"punishing heat\" of the location, and stated that \"the physical presence of Paul Newman is the reason this movie works: The smile, the innocent blue eyes, the lack of strutting.\", which no other actor could have produced as effectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-cool-hand-luke-1967|title=Cool Hand Luke|work=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=October 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602235648/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-cool-hand-luke-1967|archivedate=June 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nContrary to the general consensus, Newman's biographer Lawrence J. Quirk thought that it was one of Newman's weaker performances, stating \"For once, even Newman's famed charisma fails him, for in ''Cool Hand Luke'' he completely lacks the charm that, say, [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'' effortlessly exhibits when he plays a screw-up who also winds up (briefly) incarcerated.\"{{sfn|Quirk|2009|p=154}} However, Quirk added that Newman's performance was stronger in the second half and said that \"to be fair to Newman, he was trying his damnedest to play an impossible part, since Luke is a convict's rationalization fantasy and never a real character.\"{{sfn|Quirk|2009|p=155}} Some authors have criticized the film's depiction of prison life at the time. In a review entitled \"Sheer Beauty in the Wrong Place\", ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', while praising the film's photography,  criticized the influence of the visual styles in the depictions of the prison camp. The magazine declared that the landscapes turned it into \"a rest camp (in which) the men are getting plenty of sleep, food and healthy outdoor exercise.\" that despite the presence of the guards showed that there were \"worse ways to pay one's debt with society.\"{{sfn|Schickel, Richard|p={{google books|id=VUkEAAAAMBAJ|page=10}}|1967}} Ron Clooney also remarked that prisons \"were not hotels and certainly not the stuff of ''Cool Hand Luke'' movies.\"{{sfn|Clooney|2011|p=231}}\n\n===Legacy===\nIn 2003, [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]] rated Luke as the 30th greatest hero in American cinema,{{sfn|AFI|2003}} and three years later, [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers]]: America's Most Inspiring Movies rated Cool Hand Luke number 71.{{sfn|AFI|2007}} In 2006, Luke was ranked 53rd in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters.\"{{sfn|Empire Magazine staff 2|2005}} The movie solidified Newman's status as a box-office star, while the film is considered a touchstone of the era.{{sfn|DiLeo, John|p=73|2010}} The film was an inductee of the 2005 [[National Film Registry]] list.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520050712/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/ |archivedate=May 20, 2017 |df=mdy-all }} | accessed 3/18/2018.</ref>{{sfn|Dewitt, Joanne|p=9|2011}}\n\nThe book was adapted into a [[West End theatre|West End]] play by Emma Reeves.
