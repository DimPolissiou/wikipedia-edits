This mile long stretch of red-brick industry was home to factories making clothing and textiles, furniture, pharmaceuticals, household cleaning products, quilts, books and magazines and the world-famous 'Pelaw' shoe polish.\n\nThe factories created Pelaw, and were a significant employer in the area during most of the twentieth century. Due to inevitable foreign competition, the prevailing economic climate, and government policies of the times, the majority of the factories were closed and demolished between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, to be replaced in recent years by modern housing estates. \n\nOnly one of the original CWS buildings \u2013 the Cabinet Factory \u2013 is extant. The Cabinet Factory in [[Bill Quay]], which later became a major ''Brentford Nylons'' plant, has been redeveloped, now housing Stonehills Business Park.

This mile long stretch of red-brick industry was home to factories making clothing and textiles, furniture, pharmaceuticals, household cleaning products, quilts, books and magazines and the world-famous 'Pelaw' shoe polish.\n\nThe factories created Pelaw, and were a significant employer in the area during most of the twentieth century. Due to inevitable foreign competition, the prevailing economic climate, and government policies of the times, the majority of the factories were closed and demolished between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, to be replaced in recent years by modern housing estates. \n\nOnly one of the original CWS buildings \u2013 the Cabinet Factory \u2013 is extant. The Cabinet Factory in [[Bill Quay]], which later became a major ''Brentford Nylons'' plant, has been redeveloped, now housing Stonehills Business Park. The last factory to be demolished was the Shirt Factory, the site having since been redeveloped in to a supermarket.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/old-pelaw-shirt-factory-gateshead-11827518|title=The old Pelaw shirt factory in Gateshead: Now a new Lidl store is planned on the site|last=Morton|first=David|date=1 September 2016|website=ChronicleLive|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the [[2011 United Kingdom census|2011 Census]], the ''Pelaw and Heworth'' [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|ward]] has a population of 9,100.

Me real name Sid Monster.}}</ref> Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and [[eggplant]].\n\nHe is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who ironically does not like cookies). All three share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and \"[[googly eyes]].\" He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.

All three share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and \"[[googly eyes]].\" He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTwo years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' \u2014 and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was \"given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie.\" He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L.

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new.

In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths.

Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples.

The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to [[Hindu cosmology]] and the layers of [[Loka]].<ref name=\"SEDYAWATIp4\">{{harvp|Sedyawati|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure elements ===\n[[File:Prambanan Cross Section Shiva.svg|thumb|upright|The Shiva temple Candi Prambanan consist of three ascending realms, temple's base (Bhurloka), body (Bhurvaloka) and roof (Svarloka).]]\nThe candi structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons. Where humans still bound by their lust, desire and unholy way of life. The outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhurloka''.\n* [[Bhuvarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]''), the middle realm of holy people, [[rishi]]s, ascetics, and lesser gods. People here began to see the light of truth. The middle courtyard and the body of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhuvarloka''.\n* [[Svarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]''), the highest and holiest realm of gods, also known as ''[[svarga]]loka''. The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure. While ''[[stupa]]'' or dagoba cylindrical structure served as the pinnacle of Buddhist ones.\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Soekmono]], an Indonesian archaeologist, has classified the ''candi'' styles into two main groups: a central Java style, which predominantly date from before 1,000 CE, and an eastern Java style, which date from after 1,000 CE. He groups the temples of Sumatra and Bali into the eastern Java style.<ref>{{cite book | last =Soekmono | first =Dr R.| title =Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2 | publisher =Penerbit Kanisius | year =1973 | location =Yogyakarta, Indonesia| pages =86 | url = | doi = | isbn = 979-413-290-X}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Pawon]] temple near Borobudur, an example of Central Javanese style, while Bajang Ratu gate in [[Trowulan]] is an example of Eastern Javanese style.\n| align = left\n\n| image1 = Pawon Temple.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = Pawon\n| caption1 = <center>'''Central Java style''' <br/>[[Pawon]] temple</center>\n| link1 =\n\n| image2 = Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg\n| width2 = 164\n| alt2 = Bajang Ratu\n| caption2 = <center>'''Eastern Java style''' <br/> Bajang Ratu gate</center>\n| link2 =\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\n!width=\"70px\"|Parts of the temple\n!width=\"140px\"|Central Java Style\n!width=\"140px\"|Eastern Java Style\n|- \n|Shape of the structure\n|Tends to be bulky\n|Tends to be slender and tall\n|- \n|Roof\n|Clearly shows stepped roof sections, usually consist of 3 parts\n|The multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure smoothly \n|- \n|Pinnacle\n|Stupa (Buddhist temples), Ratna or Vajra (Hindu temples)\n|Cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes Dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples)\n|- \n|Portal and niches adornment\n|Kala-Makara style; Kala head without lower jaw opening its mouth located on top of the portal, connected with double Makara on each side of the portal\n|Only Kala head sneering with the mouth complete with lower jaw located on top of the portal, Makara is absent\n|- \n|Relief\n|Projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style\n|Projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stylized style similar to Balinese wayang image\n|- \n|Layout and location of the main temple\n|Concentric mandala, symmetric, formal; with main temple located in the center of the complex surrounded by smaller ''perwara'' temples in regular rows\n|Linear, asymmetric, followed topography of the site; with main temple located in the back or furthermost from the entrance, often located in the highest ground of the complex, ''perwara'' temples is located in front of the main temple\n|- \n|Direction\n|Mostly faced east\n|Mostly faced west\n|- \n|Materials\n|Mostly andesite stone\n|Mostly red brick\n|-  \n|}\n[[File:Candi Bima, Dieng 1179.jpg|thumb|ringt|upright|Bima temple, one of [[Dieng temples]]. It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]].

Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].
