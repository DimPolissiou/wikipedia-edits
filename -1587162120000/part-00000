In total, there are more than 1000 students. It was established in 1993 as The National Conservatory of Music, with its first branch in Ramallah, opening in October of that year.\n\nIn September 2004, the name of the conservatory was changed to The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in honor of the Palestinian musician and intellectual [[Edward Said]], the accomplished classical [[pianist]] and scholar of international studies, and a founder and benefactor of music for east-west dialogue (see the [[West-Eastern Divan Orchestra]] and [[Barenboim-Said Akademie]]).\n\n== Orchestras and Ensembles ==\n\nThe ESNCM administrates the [[Palestine Youth Orchestra]] and the [[Palestine National Orchestra]], in addition to a number smaller projects. The recently formed [[Palestine Strings]] ensemble performed with [[Nigel Kennedy]] in 2012, and toured the USA in 2011. Its youth orchestra - the PYO - has performed in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Greece]], [[Bahrain]], [[Germany]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. It enjoys the support of international partner institutions including the [[Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The ESNCM's professional orchestra - the PNO - formed in December 2010, has performed in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]] and [[Indonesia]]. Both orchestras have an agenda of promoting music by living Arab composers. The ESNCM Orchestra, the only Palestinian symphony orchestra performing in Palestine today where all the musicians are drawn from the local communities, promotes concerts throughout the year in the main Palestinian towns and cities. It performs an eclectic mix of film western classical music, opera, arrangements of Arabic music and film music. The ESNCM has several resident Arabic music ensembles, student and professional, which have toured throughout the world, and its students have taken part in collaborative projects with well-known international musicians.\n\n== Festivals and Concerts ==\n\nIn addition to administrating two major festivals, the ESNCM promotes concerts of Arabic, western classical and jazz music throughout Palestine at all times of year. It is responsible for the annual Arabic music [[Layali Tarab fi Quds al Arab]] festival, and the mainly classical [[Jasmine Festival]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1990, five Palestinian musicians and music teachers conducted a study on the status of [[music in Palestine]] upon a request by the Welfare Association. The preliminary findings of the study convinced the team that there was an urgent need to establish a music school to fill the huge gap in music education within the Palestinian society. In 1993, after three years of concerted efforts by these musicians, and with the support and encouragement of friends, foremost amongst whom were Edward Karkar, Munther Nabulsi, Huda Khoury and Linda Khalil Khoury, the conservatory was launched as the National Conservatory of Music, falling under the umbrella of the Board of Trustees of [[Birzeit University]], who offered the Conservatory premises in the University Board building in Ramallah and appointed the following founders to the Supervisory Board at the Conservatory: Salwa Tabri, Rima Tarazi, Amin Nasser, Nadia Abboushi and Suhail Khoury.\n\nIn October of that year, the first branch of the Conservatory opened in Ramallah. There were 40 students, three part-time teachers, a secretary, and a volunteer director \u2013 one of the co-founders, Amin Nasser. A few years later, the Conservatory opened two other branches in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. And in summer of 2010 the launch of Nablus branch.\n\nIn September 2004 as a tribute to the invaluable intellectual and cultural contributions to humanity of the late Dr. Edward Said, an honorary member of the Board, the name of the Conservatory was officially changed to The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.\n\n== Branches ==\n\nThere are currently five branches of the ESNCM, located in Jerusalem, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Nablus and Gaza City (inaugurated in 2012), with over 1000 students altogether. Each Branch has its own academic director and administrative manager who handle the day-to-day running of their schools. This setup makes room for the future opening of new branches on one hand, and on the other hand, it guarantees the same level of education and services to the students and community in whichever city the ESNCM has or opens a branch.\n\n== Academic Programs ==\n\nThe ESNCM offers two programs of study - the regular and the amateur program.\n\n\"The Regular Program\"\n\nThe music program of study at the ESNCM has been designed to give regular students a broadly structured instrumental and theoretical musical education. It consists of three levels:\n#The Preparatory level. This is not a mandatory level.\n\n#The Elementary level.\n\n#The Intermediate level.\n\nAfter completing the three levels successfully, students will be eligible for a diploma that will qualify them to the university level program at the ESNCM (not open yet), which will train them to become professional musicians. Students would also be in a position to apply to any university or academy of music of their choice.\n\n=== The Regular Program ===\n\nconsists of training in a Western or Arabic instrument, with examinations in 8 grades, each of which can be completed in a maximum of 20 months. It also includes theory, ear training, and history and appreciation of Arabic, classical, jazz and world music. The program also emphasizes group playing, choirs and group Arabic percussion. The program is set up in a manner to give students the broadest possible education in both Arabic and Western music cultures.\n\n=== The Amateur Program ===\n\nPrivate lessons are also offered to amateurs and music lovers without having to comply with the regular curriculum or to sit for exams. In some cases amateur students may register for other group courses subject to the approval of the teacher of the course, and provided that the student is at a level at which he/she could benefit from it.\n\nStudents in the amateur program do not get credit or certificates for classes and courses that they have attended.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ncm.birzeit.edu/ The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music official site]\n\n{{coord missing|Palestine}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, The}}\n[[Category:Music schools in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:Bethlehem]]\n[[Category:Education in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:1993 establishments in the Palestinian territories]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Edward Said National Conservatory of Music''' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0639\u0647\u062f \u0627\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0642\u0649}} ''Ma`had Edward Sa`\u012bd al-Wa\u1e6daniy lil-Mus\u012bq\u0101'') is a [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]] music [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] with branches in [[Ramallah]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Nablus]] and [[Gaza City]].

Students would also be in a position to apply to any university or academy of music of their choice.\n\n=== The Regular Program ===\n\nconsists of training in a Western or Arabic instrument, with examinations in 8 grades, each of which can be completed in a maximum of 20 months. It also includes theory, ear training, and history and appreciation of Arabic, classical, jazz and world music. The program also emphasizes group playing, choirs and group Arabic percussion. The program is set up in a manner to give students the broadest possible education in both Arabic and Western music cultures.\n\n=== The Amateur Program ===\n\nPrivate lessons are also offered to amateurs and music lovers without having to comply with the regular curriculum or to sit for exams. In some cases amateur students may register for other group courses subject to the approval of the teacher of the course, and provided that the student is at a level at which he/she could benefit from it.\n\nStudents in the amateur program do not get credit or certificates for classes and courses that they have attended.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ncm.birzeit.edu/ The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music official site]\n\n{{coord missing|Palestine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, The}}\n[[Category:Music schools in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:Bethlehem]]\n[[Category:Education in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:1993 establishments in the Palestinian territories]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said_National_Conservatory_of_Music"}

He was captured by Alauddin's general [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]] during the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|1299 invasion of Gujarat]], and rose to prominence in the 1300s.\n\nAs a commander of Alauddin's forces, Kafur defeated the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Mongol invaders in 1306]]. Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Yadavas]] (1308), the [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Kakatiyas]] (1310), the [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Hoysalas]] (1311), and the [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|Pandyas]] (1311). From these campaigns, he brought back many treasures, and many elephants and horses for the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nFrom 1313 to 1315, Kafur served as Alauddin's governor of [[Devagiri]]. When Alauddin fell seriously ill in 1315, Kafur was recalled to Delhi, where he exercised power as ''[[Nawab|Na'ib]]'' ([[viceroy]]). After Alauddin's death, he tried to usurp the power by appointing Alauddin's minor son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin Omar]] as a [[puppet monarch]].

Kafur convinced Alauddin to order the killing of Alp Khan in the royal palace.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}} He also had Khizr Khan first banished from court to [[Amroha]], and then imprisoned in Gwalior, and had Khizr's brother Shadi Khan imprisoned. According to stories that circulated as far as Persia, Khizr Khan, his mother and Alp Khan had hatched a conspiracy to poison Alauddin, so that Khizr Khan could be appointed as the new Sultan, but Alauddin was able to execute them all before he died. This story was corroborated to some extent by Ibn Battuta. The story may just have been Kafur's propaganda.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}\n\nNext, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. At this meeting, Alauddin's 6-year-old son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]] was declared the new heir apparent, and it was decided that Kafur would act as his [[regent]] after Alauddin's death. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to speak during the meeting, but his silence was taken as consent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}\n\nThe officers supportive of Kafur included [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din \"Gurg\"]], whose family came from [[Kabul]]. It appears that Kafur and other officers of non-Turkic origin allied to counter the [[Khalaj people|Khalaj]] establishment of the Sultanate.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=177}}\n\n== <span id=\"As the regent\"></span>As regent ==\n\nWhen Alauddin died, on the night of 4 January 1316, Kafur brought his body from the [[Siri Fort|Siri Palace]] and had it buried in the mausoleum that had been built before Alauddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Ziauddin Barani claimed that, according to \"some people\", Kafur murdered Alauddin.{{sfn|R. Vanita|S. Kidwai|2000|p=132}}\n\nThe day after Alauddin's death, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers and nobles in the palace. There, he read out a will of the late sultan that named Shihabuddin as his successor while disinheriting Khizr Khan, and then seated Shihabuddin on the throne as the new Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} As regent, Kafur held power for a short time\u201435 days, according to Barani; 1 month, according to Isami; and 25 days, according to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]].{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=428}}{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}} During this period, he held a daily ceremonial court in the morning at the [[Siri_Fort#Structure|Hazar Sutun Palace]]. After the short ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and dismiss the courtiers. He would then meet the officers in his chambers on the ground floor, and issue various orders. He ordered the ministries of revenue, secretariat, war, and commerce to maintain the laws and regulations established by Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=425-426}} The officers of the ministries were asked to consult Kafur on all policy matters.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nKafur took several actions to maintain his control over the throne. Before burying Alauddin, he had taken the royal ring from the Sultan's finger. He gave this ring to his general, Sumbul, and asked him to march to [[Gwalior Fort|Gwalior]] and take control of the fort, using the ring as a symbol of royal authority. He asked Sumbul to send the fort's governor to Delhi, and ordered Sumbul to return to Delhi after blinding Khizr Khan, who had been imprisoned in Gwalior.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Sumbul carried out these orders, and was appointed ''Amir-i Hijab'' as a reward.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} On his first day as regent, Kafur also ordered his barber to blind Khizr Khan's [[Sibling#Half|uterine brother]] Shadi Khan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} This incident intensified resentment of Kafur among the Turkic nobles.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} Kafur deprived Alauddin's senior queen, who bore the title [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|''Malika-i Jahan'']], of all her property, and later imprisoned her at Gwalior fort. He also imprisoned [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah]], another adult son of Alauddin. According to Firishta, Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nAlp Khan's murder had led to a rebellion in Gujarat, and Kafur had sent [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din \"Gurg\"]] to suppress it.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=85}} Meanwhile, Kafur summoned the [[Devagiri]] governor, [[Ayn al-Mulk Multani]], to Delhi with all his soldiers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} While Multani was on his way, Kamal al-Din was killed in Gujarat.{{sfn|I.

The rebellion could be suppressed only after Kafur's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\n== Death ==\n\nThe former bodyguards (''paiks'') of Alauddin disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master. Led by Mubashshir, Bashir, Saleh, and Munir, these bodyguards decided to kill Kafur. When Kafur became suspicious about a conspiracy against him, he summoned Mubashshir to his room. Mubashshir, who was permitted to carry his arms in the royal quarters since Alauddin's days, wounded Kafur with his sword. His associates then entered the room, and beheaded Kafur, also killing 2-3 gatekeepers who attempted to protect Kafur.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=427}} This event took place sometime in February 1316.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}}\n\nAccording to an account mentioned by the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]], Kafur had sent some ''paiks'' to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace, and convinced them to kill Kafur instead.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=321}} Another legend attributes Kafur's death to his mother's prayers to the mystic Shaikhzada Jam.

He was captured by Alauddin's general [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]] during the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|1299 invasion of Gujarat]], and rose to prominence in the 1300s.\n\nAs a commander of Alauddin's forces, Kafur defeated the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Mongol invaders in 1306]]. Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Yadavas]] (1308), the [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Kakatiyas]] (1310), the [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Hoysalas]] (1311), and the [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|Pandyas]] (1311). From these campaigns, he brought back many treasures, and many elephants and horses for the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nFrom 1313 to 1315, Kafur served as Alauddin's governor of [[Devagiri]]. When Alauddin fell seriously ill in 1315, Kafur was recalled to Delhi, where he exercised power as ''[[Nawab|Na'ib]]'' ([[viceroy]]). After Alauddin's death, he tried to usurp the power by appointing Alauddin's minor son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin Omar]] as a [[puppet monarch]].

The story may just have been Kafur's propaganda.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}\n\nNext, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. At this meeting, Alauddin's 6-year-old son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]] was declared the new heir apparent, and it was decided that Kafur would act as his [[regent]] after Alauddin's death. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to speak during the meeting, but his silence was taken as consent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}\n\nThe officers supportive of Kafur included [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din \"Gurg\"]], whose family came from [[Kabul]]. It appears that Kafur and other officers of non-Turkic origin allied to counter the [[Khalaj people|Khalaj]] establishment of the Sultanate.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=177}}\n\n== <span id=\"As the regent\"></span>As regent ==\n\nWhen Alauddin died, on the night of 4 January 1316, Kafur brought his body from the [[Siri Fort|Siri Palace]] and had it buried in the mausoleum that had been built before Alauddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Ziauddin Barani claimed that, according to \"some people\", Kafur murdered Alauddin.{{sfn|R. Vanita|S. Kidwai|2000|p=132}}\n\nThe day after Alauddin's death, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers and nobles in the palace. There, he read out a will of the late sultan that named Shihabuddin as his successor while disinheriting Khizr Khan, and then seated Shihabuddin on the throne as the new Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} As regent, Kafur held power for a short time\u201435 days, according to Barani; 1 month, according to Isami; and 25 days, according to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]].{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=428}}{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}} During this period, he held a daily ceremonial court in the morning at the [[Siri_Fort#Structure|Hazar Sutun Palace]]. After the short ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and dismiss the courtiers. He would then meet the officers in his chambers on the ground floor, and issue various orders. He ordered the ministries of revenue, secretariat, war, and commerce to maintain the laws and regulations established by Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=425-426}} The officers of the ministries were asked to consult Kafur on all policy matters.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nKafur took several actions to maintain his control over the throne. Before burying Alauddin, he had taken the royal ring from the Sultan's finger. He gave this ring to his general, Sumbul, and asked him to march to [[Gwalior Fort|Gwalior]] and take control of the fort, using the ring as a symbol of royal authority. He asked Sumbul to send the fort's governor to Delhi, and ordered Sumbul to return to Delhi after blinding Khizr Khan, who had been imprisoned in Gwalior.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Sumbul carried out these orders, and was appointed ''Amir-i Hijab'' as a reward.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} On his first day as regent, Kafur also ordered his barber to blind Khizr Khan's [[Sibling#Half|uterine brother]] Shadi Khan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} This incident intensified resentment of Kafur among the Turkic nobles.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} Kafur deprived Alauddin's senior queen, who bore the title [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|''Malika-i Jahan'']], of all her property, and later imprisoned her at Gwalior fort. He also imprisoned [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah]], another adult son of Alauddin. According to Firishta, Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nAlp Khan's murder had led to a rebellion in Gujarat, and Kafur had sent [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din \"Gurg\"]] to suppress it.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=85}} Meanwhile, Kafur summoned the [[Devagiri]] governor [[Ayn al-Mulk Multani]] to Delhi with all his soldiers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} While Multani was on his way, Kamal al-Din was killed in Gujarat.{{sfn|I. H. Siddiqui|1980|p=105}} Kafur then appointed Multani as the governor of Gujarat, and asked him to march there to suppress the rebellion. The rebellion could be suppressed only after Kafur's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\n== Death ==\n\nThe former bodyguards (''paiks'') of Alauddin disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master. Led by Mubashshir, Bashir, Saleh, and Munir, these bodyguards decided to kill Kafur. When Kafur became suspicious about a conspiracy against him, he summoned Mubashshir to his room. Mubashshir, who was permitted to carry his arms in the royal quarters since Alauddin's days, wounded Kafur with his sword. His associates then entered the room, and beheaded Kafur, also killing 2-3 gatekeepers who attempted to protect Kafur.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=427}} This event took place sometime in February 1316.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}}\n\nAccording to an account mentioned by the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]], Kafur had sent some ''paiks'' to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace, and convinced them to kill Kafur instead.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=321}} Another legend attributes Kafur's death to his mother's prayers to the mystic Shaikhzada Jam. However, these accounts are latter-day fabrications. According to Barani's near-contemporary account, the ''paiks'' took the initiative to kill Kafur on their own.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=428-429}}\n\nKafur's killers freed Mubarak Shah, who was appointed as the new regent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=427-428}} A few months later, Mubarak Shah usurped the power by blinding Shihabuddin.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|pp=178-179}} Kafur's killers claimed credit for making him the king, and started demanding high positions in the royal court.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Instead, Mubarak Shah had them executed.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nThe chronicler Barani was severely critical of Kafur but historian [[Abraham Eraly]] believes that Barani's criticism of Kafur is not credible as Barani was deeply prejudiced against Kafur, presumably because of Kafur's non-[[Turkic people|Turkic]], Hindu origins and eunuch status.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=178|ps=:\"Barani is severely critical of Kafur, but his excoriations are not quite credible, for he was deeply prejudiced against Malik Kafur, whom he invariably described as a 'wicked fellow', presumably because he was not a Turk but an Islamised Hindu and a eunuch.\"}}\n\n=== Tomb ===\n\nThe location of Kafur's grave is now unknown, but his [[mausoleum]] existed in the 14th century, when it was repaired by Sultan [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] (r. 1309-1388).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Firuz Shah's autobiography ''Futuhat-i-Firuzshahi'' states:{{sfn|S. R. Bakshi|Suresh K. Sharma|1995|p=276}}\n\n{{quote|Tomb of ''Malik'' ''Taj-ul-Mulk'' Kafur, the great ''wazir'' of Sultan Ala-ud-din. He was a most wise and intelligent minister, and acquired many countries, on which the horses of former sovereigns had never placed their hoofs, and he caused the ''[[Khutba]]'' of Sultan Ala-ud-din to be repeated there. He had 52,000 horsemen. His grave had been levelled with the ground, and his tomb laid low.

Democrat Stephanie Herseth was selected as the Democratic nominee for this special election and she defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Larry Diedrich with 51 percent of the vote in a close-fought election on June 1, 2004. Herseth's victory briefly gave the state its first all-Democratic congressional delegation since 1937.\n\n=== 2004 general election ===\nIn the November general election, Herseth was elected to a full term with 53.4 percent of the vote, an increase of a few percentage points compared with the even closer June special elections. Herseth's vote margin in June was about 3,000 votes, but by November it had grown to over 29,000.\n\nHerseth thereby became the first woman in state history to win a full term in the U.S. Congress.\n\nBoth elections were hard-fought and close compared to many House races in the rest of the United States, and the special election was watched closely by a national audience.

Democrat Stephanie Herseth was selected as the Democratic nominee for this special election and she defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Larry Diedrich with 51 percent of the vote in a close-fought election on June 1, 2004.
