A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

He is a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJoe grew up in [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, New York]], a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative Lawrence Clay-Bey.  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074408/http://babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=2016-02-06 }}</ref> In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/466/boxer-baby-joe-mesi-visits-golisano-childrens-hospital.aspx</ref>\n\n=== Injury and suspension ===\nMesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two [[subdural hematoma]]s <ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3299563.html</ref>\n\nThe injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion [[Vassiliy Jirov]]. In round 9,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325185242/http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}</ref><ref>http://wn.com/Vassily_Jirov</ref> Mesi was knocked down from a right hook and in the tenth round he was knocked down two more times. Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges.\n\nIn June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \"in no more danger than any other boxer.\"  Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote.  In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], opinion that: \"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\" Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \"You play football, you don't play boxing.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/sports/othersports/suspension-upheld-but-boxer-is-fighting-it.html | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension Upheld But Boxer Is Fighting It | date=15 July 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe suspension effectively [[blacklist]]ed him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the [[full faith and credit clause]]. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had 'leaked' news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005.  However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials.  Mesi has since been licensed by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Boxing Commission in February 2006, the [[Louisiana]] State Boxing Commission in June 2006, the [[Arkansas]] State Boxing Commission in August 2006, the [[Michigan]] State Boxing Commission in September 2006, the [[West Virginia]] State Boxing Commission in February 2007, and the [[Rhode Island]] State Boxing Commission in October 2007.\n\nJoe Mesi has one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight. Ranked #1 heavyweight contender by the WBC prior to his two-year layoff, Mesi was #16 in the December 2007 rankings.<ref name=\"mesiranking\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |publisher=World Boxing Council \n |title=WBC Heavyweight Ratings \n |date=October 13, 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810070242/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |archivedate=August 10, 2007 \n}}</ref> He has not actively boxed since 2007, having instead turned to politics.\n\n==Political career==\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Mesi publicly expressed his interest to run for the [[New York State Senate]].

retired [[Boxing|boxer]] and politician from [[Tonawanda, New York]]. He is a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJoe grew up in [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, New York]], a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative Lawrence Clay-Bey.  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074408/http://babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=2016-02-06 }}</ref> In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/466/boxer-baby-joe-mesi-visits-golisano-childrens-hospital.aspx</ref>\n\n=== Injury and suspension ===\nMesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two [[subdural hematoma]]s <ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3299563.html</ref>\n\nThe injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion [[Vassiliy Jirov]]. In round 9,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325185242/http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}</ref><ref>http://wn.com/Vassily_Jirov</ref> Mesi was knocked down from a right hook and in the tenth round he was knocked down two more times. Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges.\n\nIn June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \"in no more danger than any other boxer.\"  Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote.  In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], opinion that -  \"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\" - Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \"You play football, you don't play boxing.\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/sports/othersports/suspension-upheld-but-boxer-is-fighting-it.html | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension Upheld But Boxer Is Fighting It | date=15 July 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe suspension effectively [[blacklist]]ed him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the [[full faith and credit clause]]. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had 'leaked' news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005.  However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials.  Mesi has since been licensed by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Boxing Commission in February 2006, the [[Louisiana]] State Boxing Commission in June 2006, the [[Arkansas]] State Boxing Commission in August 2006, the [[Michigan]] State Boxing Commission in September 2006, the [[West Virginia]] State Boxing Commission in February 2007, and the [[Rhode Island]] State Boxing Commission in October 2007.\n\nJoe Mesi has one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight. Ranked #1 heavyweight contender by the WBC prior to his two-year layoff, Mesi was #16 in the December 2007 rankings.<ref name=\"mesiranking\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |publisher=World Boxing Council \n |title=WBC Heavyweight Ratings \n |date=October 13, 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810070242/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |archivedate=August 10, 2007 \n}}</ref> He has not actively boxed since 2007, having instead turned to politics.\n\n==Political career==\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Mesi publicly expressed his interest to run for the [[New York State Senate]].

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution.

[[Red panda|Wikipedia-Red pandas]]\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReports of Committee)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}
