Jim also collaborated with [[Frank Nasworthy]] on a series of ads for Cadillac Wheels, the first polyurethane skateboard wheel. The posters, with titles like, \"From Out of the West\" and \"Accept No Substitutes\" came to represent the paradigm shift taking place in skateboarding.

Evans worked on Killer's Kiss and Growing Pains. He also helped to prepare an American release for a series of Japanese films called The Baby Cart Series. Working with director [[Robert Houston (actor)|Robert Houston]] and his partner [[David Weisman]], Jim created the poster and title treatment for the 1980 release titled [[Shogun Assassin]], Jim's son Gibran Evans voiced the narrative as Daigoro. An ongoing creative collaboration with John Hegeman, president of [[Orion Pictures]], led to Jim illustrating promotional posters for the [[Saw (franchise)|SAW]] films for [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], [[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]] for [[Blumhouse Productions|BH Tilt]], the film [[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]] for [[Regency Enterprises|New Regency]], and most recently, [[Anna and the Apocalypse|Anna And the Apocalypse]] and a poster-centric street art image for [[Child's Play (2019 film)|Child's Play]].\n\n===Fine art===\nAn association with ''[[Playboy]]'' led to a series of silkscreen portraits of celebrities. The magazine commissioned Evans to do portraits of [[Sean Connery]], [[David Letterman]], [[Joe Montana]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. These portraits led to art shows in Chicago and New York, in addition to a large scale show at the Hansen Gallery Rodeo Drive location, where he did portraits of Sly Stallone, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Billy Idol]], Steve Vai, [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Robert Mitchum]]. Later a show of feminist icons, done in collaboration with pop artist Richard Duardo, had a successful run at the Zero One gallery in Los Angeles.

After a successful career as a comic illustrator, Evans worked as a painter, poster maker, and owner of the digital design group Division 13.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nEvans was born in San Diego amidst the surfing culture of southern California. After attending [[Oceanside High School]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Evans|url=http://www.clubofthewaves.com/surf-artist/jim-evans.php}}</ref> he played in several local bands and then created comic strips for the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' and other underground papers while working for Eric Matlen's Sawyer Press. Evans then began to take commissions doing work in several comic books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comixjoint.com/dyingdolphin.html |title=The Dying Dolphin |accessdate= |last=Evans |first=Jim }}</ref> These included ''[[Yellow Dog (comics)|Yellow Dog]]'', and a solo effort titled ''The Dying Dolphin'', released by the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]-based [[Print Mint]], it included collaborations with [[Rick Griffin]] and [[Ron Cobb]]. Evans also drew for ''[[Slow Death Funnies]]'', and ''Tales from the Tube'', which was published by ''[[Surfer Magazine]]'', and included contributions by ''[[Zap Comix]]'' artists [[Robert Crumb]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and [[Rick Griffin]].\n\n===Hawaii===\nThe Underground period was followed by a move to the North Shore of Oahu, and contributions to both ''[[Surfer (magazine)|Surfer]]'' and ''[[Surfing Magazine|Surfing]]'' magazines, as well as illustrating a succession of surfing posters, such as Hal Jepson's \"A Sea For Yourself\", and the posters for Bud Browne's successful \"Going Surfin'\" series.<ref>{{cite book | last = Warshaw | first = Matt | authorlink = | title = Surf Movie Tonite!: Surf Movie Poster Art, 1957-2004 | publisher = Chronicle Books | location = | pages = | asin = 0811848736 | doi = | id = | isbn =  }}</ref>  He did posters for many Australian surf films like ''On Any Morning'', and ''A Winter's Tale''.  During this period, he also did posters for Oahu's Crater Celebration, featuring bands like [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Little Feat]].  Some of the time in Hawaii was spent doing commercial and advertising art for ad agencies, including ads and record sleeves for [[Don Ho|Don Ho and the Allihis]], and [[Society of Seven|The Society of Seven]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clubofthewaves.com/surf-artist/jim-evans.php | title = Club of the Waves Jim Evans | accessdate = 2012-07-26 | date = 16 August 2011 | work = Club of the Waves}}</ref>\n\n===Album art===\nReturning to the mainland, Evans began to do record sleeves and continued his relationship with ''Surfer'' and ''Surfing'' magazines, doing numerous illustrations<ref>{{cite book | last = Weyland | first = Jocko | authorlink = | title = The Answer Is Never: A Skateboarder's History of the World | url = https://archive.org/details/answerisnever00jock | url-access = registration | publisher = Grove Press | location = | pages = | asin = 0802139450 | doi = | id = | isbn =  }}</ref> for both, including a collaboration with surfer Mike Doyle on a series of ads for Wax Research.

At the same time, he created a logo for The Beach Boys that is still used.  This, in turn, led to the commission to create a logo for the band Chicago.  His list of album jackets includes; [[Alice Coltrane]], The Robby Kreiger Band, [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Neil Young]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Beck]], [[House of Pain]], [[Symbol Six]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face To Face]], and [[Toto (band)|Toto]].[[File:Evans painting final.jpg|thumb|200px|Jim Evans painting]]\n\nIn addition to the record sleeves and ongoing work with the surfing magazines, Evans became a contributor to the newly-formed ''Skateboarder'' magazine, handling all of the illustration work for the first four issues. Jim also collaborated with [[Frank Nasworthy]] on a series of ads for Cadillac Wheels, the first polyurethane skateboard wheel. The posters, with titles like, \"From Out of the West\" and \"Accept No Substitutes\" came to represent the paradigm shift taking place in skateboarding. Other skate art commissions included one for filmmaker / skater [[Stacy Peralta]], for an early skate film titled ''Freestylin''', as well as the poster for the first World Professional Skateboard Championships.\n\nMore recently, Evans worked with  producer [[Kevin Shirley]] to do the album art and packaging design for [[Joe Bonamassa]]\u2019s ''[[Live at the Greek Theatre (Joe Bonamassa album)|Live at the Greek Theater]].''\n\n===Film posters===\nThe period of record sleeves and skate posters ran parallel to commissions for a number of film posters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/92689353@N05/8432271400 |title=Acapulco Gold |accessdate= |date=2013-01-30 }}</ref>  Working for most of the major studios, Jim completed art for Lumiere, 20th Century Oz, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, Kentucky Fried Movie, Big Wednesday, Herowork, Acapulco Gold, [[The Space Movie]], Patrick, [[Neil Young]]'s [[Rust Never Sleeps]] (for which Jim also animated the opening title sequence), and [[John Carpenter]]'s first film [[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]].

Evans worked on Killer's Kiss and Growing Pains. He also helped to prepare an American release for a series of Japanese films called The Baby Cart Series. Working with director [[Robert Houston (actor)|Robert Houston]] and his partner [[David Weisman]], Jim created the poster and title treatment for the 1980 release titled [[Shogun Assassin]], Jim's son Gibran Evans voiced the narrative as Daigoro. An ongoing creative collaboration with John Hegeman, president of [[Orion Pictures]], led to Jim illustrating promotional posters for the [[Saw (franchise)|SAW]] films for [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], [[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]] for [[Blumhouse Productions|BH Tilt]], the film [[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]] for [[Regency Enterprises|New Regency]], and most recently, [[Anna and the Apocalypse|Anna And the Apocalypse]] and a poster-centric street art image for [[Child's Play (2019 film)|Child\u2019s Play]].\n\n===Fine art===\nAn association with ''[[Playboy]]'' led to a series of silkscreen portraits of celebrities. The magazine commissioned Evans to do portraits of [[Sean Connery]], [[David Letterman]], [[Joe Montana]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. These portraits led to art shows in Chicago and New York, in addition to a large scale show at the Hansen Gallery Rodeo Drive location, where he did portraits of Sly Stallone, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Billy Idol]], Steve Vai, [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Robert Mitchum]]. Later a show of feminist icons, done in collaboration with pop artist Richard Duardo, had a successful run at the Zero One gallery in Los Angeles. More recently Evans' art has been shown at The Nyehaus gallery, Metro Pictures and Friedrich Petzel Gallery in New York, for a bi-coastal tour called \"Swell\". Other artists in the show included [[Billy Al Bengston]], [[Ed Ruscha]], Laddie John Dill, and [[Dennis Hopper]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Roberta | authorlink = | title = Artist and Surfer as Best Buddies | work = The New York Times | date = 2010-07-22| location = | pages = | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/arts/design/23surfing.html?_r=2&pagewanted=2&ref=design | doi = | id = | isbn =  }}</ref> [[File:Stallone002.jpg|thumb|upright|''Jim Presents Sylvester Stallone with a portrait painting'' (1978)]] \nEvans\u2019 work was included in a group show titled \"The Lords and the New Creatures\" at the NYE+BROWN gallery,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://issuu.com/kylelamar/docs/carshow_digitalcat_issuu?e=1925143/1943558 | title = The Lords and the New Creatures at NYE+BROWN | accessdate = 2011-11-22 | authors = nyehaus and brown | date = 2011-10-06 | format = PDF | publisher = nye+brown}}</ref> which also featured [[Judy Chicago]], [[Ed Moses (artist)|Ed Moses]], and [[Chris Burden]].

Demi was created by [[Steve Crompton|SS Crompton]]. Demi has appeared in numerous [[Crossover (comics)|comics crossovers]] with other characters, including ''[[Shaundra]]'', ''[[Captain Fortune]]'', ''[[Mauvette (character)|Mauvette]]'', ''[[Vampirooni]]'', ''[[Cassiopeia the Witch]]'', ''[[Djustine]]'', ''[[Crimson Gash]]'', and [[adult film star]]s [[Tracey Adams]], [[Tabitha Stevens]], [[Deja Sin]], and [[Bonnie Michaels]].\n\nOver 35 different ''Demi the Demoness'' comics have been published. Numerous artists and authors have worked on Demi comics over the years, including [[Frank Brunner]], [[Tim Vigil]], [[Seppo Makinen]], Philo, [[Ryan Vella]], Gus Norman, [[Enrico Teodorani]], Silvano, [[Diego Simone]], [[Jay Allen Sanford]], and many others. Demi has also been the subject of T-shirts, dice, a trading card set, a resin model kit, and a movie.\n\n== Publication history ==\nDemi the Demoness first appeared in ''Demi the Demoness'' #1 by [[Revolutionary Comics]]' [[Carnal Comics]] imprint in 1992. After the publisher, [[Todd Loren]] was murdered, the series moved to underground comic publisher [[Rip Off Press]] from 1993 to 1997, where eight more Demi comics were published, including a trade paperback collection and a choose-your-own-adventure book.\n\nDemi was then published by [[Revisionary Press]], the company that took over the Carnal Comics imprint.  Revisionary published six more Demi titles from 1997 to 2000. Demi's ribald adventures were also published in full-color in ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' magazine from 1996\u20131998.\n\nCarnal spun off from Revisionary in 2000 and Demi has been published in more than a dozen more comics by Carnal since then. Demi has also appeared in comics published by [[Eros Comix]], [[MU Press]], [[Hippy Comix]], and several smaller publishing ventures.\n\nDemi stories have been translated into Swedish and Italian.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n== Character biography  ==\nRaised in one of the few \"sanctuaries\" in [[Hell]], the [[Rookery]] was a hidden, safe place to be compared to the more gruesome inner areas of Hell. Demi was raised there, so she never experienced the cruelty that almost all demons possess. Thus her personality is charming and na\u00efve.\n\nAfter a Demon army attacked the Rookery, Demi escaped and found the pyramid of [[Kit-Ra]], a banished cat goddess. Kit-Ra took Demi in and she has lived there ever since. She regularly uses Kit-Ra's mystical transport mirrors to visit other worlds and times outside of Hell.\n\n== In other media ==\nA Demi the Demoness movie was released on DVD in May 2008. The film was co-written by [[SS Crompton]] and [[Steve Steele]], and directed by Steele. The film stars [[Ellie Idol]] as Demi, [[Sinn Sage]] as Vampirooni, and [[Audrey Elson]] as Lyssa the Witch.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*''Demi the Demoness'' #1 (Revolutionary/Carnal, 1992)\n*''Demi the Demoness'' #2\u20134 (Rip Off Press, 1993\u20131997)\n*''Demi the Demoness'' #5 (Revisionary/Carnal, 1999)\n*''Demi the Demoness'' #6\u20137 (Carnal Comics, 2002\u20132004)\n*''Demi Adventure Special'' (Rip Off Press, 1995) \n*''Demi: Erotic Saga Graphic Novel'' (Rip Off Press, 1996)\n*''Demi Saga of a Demoness'' (Carnal Comics, 2006)\n*''Pantheon'' #1\u20133 (Archer Books, 1995\u20131997)\n*''Demi Meets Cassiopeia'' #1 (Rip Off Press, 1997)\n*''Demi & Capt.

capital and largest city of the western [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Nayarit]].\n\nIt is located in the central part of the state, at {{coord|21|30|30|N|104|53|35|W|}}.\n<!--- {{coord|21|30|30|N|104|53|35|W|}}, ---->\nIt stands at an altitude of {{convert|915|m|ft}} above sea level, on the banks of the [[R\u00edo Mololoa]] and the [[R\u00edo Tepic]], approximately {{convert|225|km|mi}} north-west of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]]. Nearby are the extinct {{ILL|Sangang\u00fcey|es}} volcano and its crater lake. Tepic is the primary urban center of this rich agricultural region; major crops include sugarcane, tobacco and citrus fruits.\n\nThe city was founded in 1531 as ''Villa del Esp\u00edritu Santo de la Mayor Espa\u00f1a''.\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Indigenous population ===\nTepic has the second-largest indigenous population in the State of [[Nayarit]], 4,375. The most prominent groups among them are the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] (3,276), [[Cora people|Cora]] (527) and [[Pur\u00e9pecha]] (101).\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Catedral de Tepic, Nayarit, MEXICO.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]]\n[[Catholicism]] is the most prominent religion in Tepic with 94.2% of the population. Its [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Tepic|Catedral de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]], dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]], is the [[cathedral]] episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tepic]], a [[suffragan diocese|suffragan]] see in the ecclesiastical province of the [[Archdiocese of Guadalajara]].\n\n== Notable locals ==\n\n[[File:Ruinas de Jauja, Tepic.jpeg|thumb|400px|View of the ruins of Jauja]]\n* [[Juan Escutia]]: [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes|Boy hero]] of the [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Born in Tepic, between 1828 and 1832, on the morning of 13 September 1847, he fought to prevent invading U.S. forces from capturing [[Chapultepec Castle]] in [[Mexico City]]. After a brave defense, he is reported to have wrapped himself in the [[Flag of Mexico|national flag]] and leaped to his death.\n* [[Luis E. Miramontes]]: Chemist, co-inventor of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first contraceptive pill]]\n* [[Amado Nervo]]: Poet and diplomat.\n* [[Antonio Rivas Mercado]].\n* [[Emilia Ortiz]]: Contemporary painter, caricaturist and poet, after whom the major downtown ''Centro de Arte Contemporaneo Emilia Ortiz'' has been named.\n* [[Gustavo Ay\u00f3n]]: NBA basketball player\n* [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)]]: Mayor of [[San Francisco]], 1836-1842.\n* [[Luis Ernesto Franco]]: Mexican actor.\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo]]: Mexican actor. \n* [[Manuel Lozada]].\n\n== Sports ==\nNayarit had small stadiums built for [[Association football|football]] and baseball. Both now demolished, there are plans to construct [[Estadio del Bicentenario (Tepic)|new, modern, and bigger stadiums]]; the state has three sport private clubs. There are multiple football fields and places to play \"cascaritas\" (pick-up games), indoor football courts, a basketball center and gym (with wooden flooring), several volleyball courts, and a bowling alley. In addition to common sports, in the city's main park there is an olympic swimming pool and a squash field.\nIn Tepic, [[tennis]] is a popular sport, but the most popular is football ([[Association football|soccer]]).
