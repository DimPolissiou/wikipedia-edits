His stage persona, '''''William Batty''''' currently serves as the ringmaster of the [[Wanderlust Circus]], as well as the emcee of numerous vaudevillian and bohemian events in the area. Minkens is also widely known within the kink and circus communities as a violent serial rapist and proudly flaunts his exploits as being \u201cmisunderstood\u201d.....  \n\nMickens has worked in a variety of performance media: scrap-metal percussion, singing, [[butoh]], drama, [[circus skills|circus arts]], [[rock opera]], and fashion [[model (profession)#Fashion models|modeling]]. Several of his collaborative projects have been combinations of two or more of the aforementioned art forms. Mickens has also performed as composer, director, and producer of numerous theatrical productions, as well as show promoter and publicist for various venues in the Portland area, including Someday Lounge, [[Dante's]], The Jasmine Tree, and the Rotture-Branx venue complex.\n\n==Early life==\nMickens has described growing up in Los Angeles with his mother and his brother, Sam Mickens (a vocalist, guitarist, and composer for such bands as [[The Dead Science]], [[Xiu Xiu]], and [[Parenthetical Girls]]). In an interview with [[Portland Monthly]], he said he was taught to juggle at age 14 by a homeless man named Robert. \"I began to meet other people who were into that sort of thing,\" he recalls, \"and I started to think of myself as a circus performer.\"<ref name=\"portlandmonthlymag1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/blogs/culturephile-portland-arts/mickens-cp-092910/ |title=Wanderlust Ringmaster Speaks Volumes \u2013 CULTUREPHILE: PORTLAND ARTS |publisher=Portlandmonthlymag.com |date=October 2, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref>\n\nMickens began singing in local [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[Pop music|pop]] bands in Los Angeles, among them Poor Old Timer, which he described as \"blues-inflected punk music\".<ref name=\"portlandmonthlymag1\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Mickens moved to Portland, OR, and quickly became involved in a variety of theatrical and musical endeavors, including Nequaquam Vacuum (Latin for \"the void does not exist\"), an improvisational \"post-asiatic chamber noise\" ensemble, which he formed in 1999 with Tyler Armstrong and Travis McAlister. In 2004, [[Oregon Public Broadcasting]] filmed a short documentary on Mickens and Nequaquam Vacuum for the station's ''Oregon Art Beat'' program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opb.org/programs/artbeat/segments/view/370 |title=Oregon Art Beat \u2013 Noah Mickens \u00b7 Oregon Public Broadcasting |publisher=Opb.org |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}</ref> The program showed Mickens, Armstrong and McAlister performing alongside butoh dancers from the PAN Butoh troupe.\n\nMickens began organizing [[avant-garde]] performances through underground networks of artists. One such network was 36 Invisibles, which Mickens founded in 2000. Under the name 36 Invisibles, Mickens arranged and promoted performances by a variety of artists, usually at the Jasmine Tree, a small tiki bar near the [[Portland State University]] campus. He was also heavily involved with the [[Radon]] collective, another loose affiliation of avant-garde artists for which he was considered the \"Portland Liaison<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2gyrlz.org/about/core.html |title=2 Gyrlz Performative Arts |publisher=2gyrlz.org |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719052117/http://www.2gyrlz.org/about/core.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> \".

The consortium replaced [[CBC Sports]], which had held the Canadian rights to all Olympics beginning with the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 games]], although some cable rights had been sub-licensed to TSN / RDS beginning in 1998.\n\nRogers announced in September 2011 that it would withdraw from the consortium following London 2012, and therefore not participate in its bid for rights to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The company cited scheduling conflicts and financial considerations for the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2011/08/c9399.html|title=Rogers Media Withdraws from Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium in Bid for 2014/16 Olympic Games|author=[[Rogers Media]]|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-09}}</ref> Bell Media then announced a new partnership with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] to bid for Canadian [[broadcasting rights]] of Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016.

During the 2010 Winter Olympics, over-the-air station [[CJON-TV|NTV]] carried only the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's hockey gold medal game]].\n**V's coverage was produced by RDS<ref name=\"2010-coverage\" /> and mostly used that channel's talent, as V has no in-house production staff for news or sports. Similarly, most hosts for CTV's coverage came from TSN.\n**Since V has limited coverage outside Quebec, its coverage of the 2010 games was simulcast on the [[Cable Public Affairs Channel]] (CPAC), which has mandatory carriage on all cable and satellite providers.<ref>[http://cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&act=view3&section_id=21&template_id=1302&lang=e CPAC and CTV Team Up to Deliver French Olympic Coverage], CPAC / COBMC press release, 2010-02-11</ref>\n*Secondary coverage (full events and some highlights between events) aired primarily on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Sportsnet]] (English), as well as [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]] and [[RDS Info]] (French). Select TSN coverage was rebroadcast later on [[TSN2]]. [[OLN]] (English) also provided full-event coverage of selected outdoor events.\n*Multilingual coverage on various [[Omni Television]] stations:\n**[[CFMT-DT|Omni.1 (Ontario)]] only: Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Ukrainian\n**[[CJMT-DT|Omni.2 (Ontario)]], [[CJEO-DT|Omni Edmonton]], [[CJCO-DT|Omni Calgary]], [[CHNM-DT|Omni British Columbia]]: Cantonese, Mandarin\n**Omni BC only: Punjabi\n*Multilingual coverage on seven [[Asian Television Network]] channels:\n**[[ATN Bangla (Canada)|ATN Bangla]] ([[Bengali language|Bengali]])\n**[[ATN Gujarati]] ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]])\n**[[ATN Channel]] ([[Hindi]])\n**[[ATN Alpha ETC Punjabi]] and [[ATN MH1]] ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]])\n**[[ATN Jaya TV]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]])\n**[[ATN ARY Digital]] ([[Urdu]])\n*[[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] provided coverage of the 2010 games in several native languages; including ([[Cree]], [[Dene]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Michif language|Mechif]], [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]] and [[Oji-Cree]]). In some cases the network was split, with commentary in two or three different languages on the East, West, and North feeds. It also aired some English and French coverage as an overflow channel. APTN did not participate in coverage for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n===Radio===\n*English-language radio coverage aired over Rogers's [[Sportsnet Radio|Sportsnet Radio Network]]. Ten Rogers stations, namely \"Sportsnet Radio\" ([[CJCL]] Toronto and [[CFAC]] Calgary), all-news or news/talk stations ([[CKWX]] Vancouver, [[CFTR (AM)|CFTR]] Toronto, [[CFFR]] Calgary, [[CKGL]] Kitchener, [[CHNI-FM]] Saint John, [[CJNI-FM]] Halifax, and [[CKNI-FM]] Moncton), as well as [[CISQ-FM]] Whistler, were listed as \"official\" Consortium stations and typically air most if not all coverage. Portions of the coverage aired on other [[Rogers Media]] radio stations, as well as several other stations in non-competing markets (such as CTV-owned [[CKGM]] [[Montreal]]).\n*[[French-language]] radio coverage of the 2010 games was aired on Cogeco radio stations, primarily airing on [[CKAC]] Montreal (then an all-sports station). No similar coverage plans were announced for the 2012 games.\n\n===Other affiliated outlets===\n*Several other Bell Media-owned channels, such as [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]) provided ancillary (non-event) coverage related to the games. CTV-owned music channel [[MuchMusic]] broadcast programming live from the Vancouver area throughout the 2010 games, including special editions of ''[[MuchOnDemand]]'' broadcast from Whistler.\n*''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', a national newspaper which was owned by CTVglobemedia at the time of the Vancouver games (and is currently 15% owned by Bell Media's parent company), was listed as part of the consortium and supplied content for its websites, however its sponsorship/coverage of the games is independent of the broadcast rights.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early coverage===\n{{Split section|discuss=Talk:Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium#Olympics on CTV before Vancouver games|date=March 2018}}\nCTV has previously broadcast the Summer Games in [[1976 Summer Games|1976]] (along with CBC) and [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], and the Winter Games in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]], [[1968 Winter Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972]], [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]], [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984]] (along with CBC), [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]].\n\nThe 1980 \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" game was aired live on CTV in Canada, but not [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] in the United States. Thus, American viewers who resided in or near the Canada\u2013US border and received the CTV signal could watch the game live, but the rest of the United States had to wait for a delayed rebroadcast.\n\n====Rights fees====\nIn 1974, [[Johnny Esaw]] (who anchored CTV's prime time Olympic coverage from 1964\u20131980) became vice-president of CTV Sports, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1990. He negotiated the host broadcasting rights to the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. As the main host broadcaster for the 1988 Winter Olympics, the CTV television network paid $45&nbsp;million for domestic rights to the 1988 Winter Olympics. Esaw also brought the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] to CTV.\n\nProduction of the broadcasting for the 1994 Winter Olympics in [[Lillehammer, Norway]], which costs NOK&nbsp;462&nbsp;million,<ref>LOOC (I): 30</ref> was the responsibility of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK), with assistance from CTV and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).<ref>LOOC (II): 206</ref> NRK had 1,424 people working at the Olympics, while international broadcasters sent an additional 4,050 accredited broadcasting personnel. The transmission rights for the games were held by EBU in Europe, [[Olympics on CBS|CBS]] in the United States, [[NHK]] in Japan, CTV in Canada, the [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union]], [[Nine Network]] in Australia, as well as other broadcasters in other countries. The total transmission rights price was 350 million United States dollars.<ref>LOOC (II): 205</ref>\n\n====Commentators====\n*[[Rod Black]] anchored CTV's coverage of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona, Spain]] and [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer, Norway]].\n*[[Don Chevrier]] provided [[television network]] coverage of the [[Olympic Games]] for North American audiences since 1972, working for the CBC, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), and the [[CTV Television Network]] before moving on to NBC.

Portions of the coverage aired on other [[Rogers Media]] radio stations, as well as several other stations in non-competing markets (such as CTV-owned [[CKGM]] [[Montreal]]).\n*[[French-language]] radio coverage of the 2010 games was aired on Cogeco radio stations, primarily airing on [[CKAC]] Montreal (then an all-sports station). No similar coverage plans were announced for the 2012 games.\n\n===Other affiliated outlets===\n*Several other Bell Media-owned channels, such as [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]) provided ancillary (non-event) coverage related to the games. CTV-owned music channel [[MuchMusic]] broadcast programming live from the Vancouver area throughout the 2010 games, including special editions of ''[[MuchOnDemand]]'' broadcast from Whistler.\n*''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', a national newspaper which was owned by CTVglobemedia at the time of the Vancouver games (and is currently 15% owned by Bell Media's parent company), was listed as part of the consortium and supplied content for its websites, however its sponsorship/coverage of the games is independent of the broadcast rights.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early coverage===\n{{Split section|discuss=Talk:Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium#Olympics on CTV before Vancouver games|date=March 2018}}\nCTV has previously broadcast the Summer Games in [[1976 Summer Games|1976]] (along with CBC) and [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], and the Winter Games in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]], [[1968 Winter Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972]], [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]], [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984]] (along with CBC), [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]].\n\nThe 1980 \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" game was aired live on CTV in Canada, but not [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] in the United States. Thus, American viewers who resided in or near the Canada\u2013US border and received the CTV signal could watch the game live, but the rest of the United States had to wait for a delayed rebroadcast.\n\n====Rights fees====\nIn 1974, [[Johnny Esaw]] (who anchored CTV's prime time Olympic coverage from 1964\u20131980) became vice-president of CTV Sports, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1990. He negotiated the host broadcasting rights to the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. As the main host broadcaster for the 1988 Winter Olympics, the CTV television network paid $45&nbsp;million for domestic rights to the 1988 Winter Olympics. Esaw also brought the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] to CTV.\n\nProduction of the broadcasting for the 1994 Winter Olympics in [[Lillehammer, Norway]], which costs NOK&nbsp;462&nbsp;million,<ref>LOOC (I): 30</ref> was the responsibility of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK), with assistance from CTV and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).<ref>LOOC (II): 206</ref> NRK had 1,424 people working at the Olympics, while international broadcasters sent an additional 4,050 accredited broadcasting personnel.

At the time of European-American settlement, it was inhabited by the [[Cherokee]] and [[Muscogee Creek people]]s, who became known as among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast.\n\nThe County was created on December 10, 1807, by an act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] with land that was originally part of [[Baldwin County, Georgia|Baldwin County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/courthouses/jasperCH.htm - GeorgiaInfo Jasper County Courthouse history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424064113/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/courthouses/jasperCH.htm |date=2006-04-24 }}</ref> It became part of the new area of upland settlement through the South eventually known as the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]], and a center of large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] for short-staple cotton. Invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late 18th century had made processing of this type of cotton profitable, and it was cultivated throughout the inland areas. As migration continued to the west, the county population rapidly rose and fell through the nineteenth century. Georgia settlers pushed Congress for the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which eventually forced most of the Native Americans west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nJasper County was originally named Randolph County (after the [[Virginia]]n [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]]). Because of Randolph's opposition to U.S. entry into the [[War of 1812]], the General Assembly changed the name of Randolph County to Jasper County on December 10, 1812, to honor [[William Jasper|Sergeant William Jasper]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] hero from South Carolina. However, Randolph's reputation eventually was restored, and in 1828, the General Assembly created a new [[Randolph County, Georgia|Randolph County]].<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/coundate.htm GeorgiaInfo.com - Georgia Counties in Order of Creation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218012756/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/coundate.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}, University of Georgia</ref>\n\n[[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]] was created from a part of the original Jasper County in 1821.\n\nThe Jasper County, Georgia courthouse, was shown and used for filming the courthouse scenes in the motion picture comedy \"My Cousin Vinny\", starring Joe Pesci. Although the setting of the movie is in Beechum County, Alabama (a fictitious place), near the end of the movie, Sheriff Farley (played by veteran actor Bruce McGill), actually mentions Jasper County, Georgia by name.\n\n==Government==\nThe county has a five-member county commission, elected from single-member districts. The commission elects a chairman and vice-chairman to aid in conducting business.\nThe county is protected by a combined Fire Rescue Department providing EMS and Fire Services. The department operates out of 7 fire stations with the majority of their manpower being volunteers. The department employs 50 personnel which include full-time, part-time and volunteer and his headed by a Fire Chief Christopher Finch.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Previous presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

At the time of European-American settlement, it was inhabited by the [[Cherokee]] and [[Muscogee Creek people]]s, who became known as among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast.\n\nThe County was created on December 10, 1807, by an act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] with land that was originally part of [[Baldwin County, Georgia|Baldwin County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/courthouses/jasperCH.htm - GeorgiaInfo Jasper County Courthouse history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424064113/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/courthouses/jasperCH.htm |date=2006-04-24 }}</ref> It became part of the new area of upland settlement through the South eventually known as the [[Black Belt (U.S. Region)|Black Belt]], and a center of large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] for short-staple cotton. Invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late 18th century had made processing of this type of cotton profitable, and it was cultivated throughout the inland areas. As migration continued to the west, the county population rapidly rose and fell through the nineteenth century. Georgia settlers pushed Congress for the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which eventually forced most of the Native Americans west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nJasper County was originally named Randolph County (after the [[Virginia]]n [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]]). Because of Randolph's opposition to U.S. entry into the [[War of 1812]], the General Assembly changed the name of Randolph County to Jasper County on December 10, 1812, to honor [[William Jasper|Sergeant William Jasper]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] hero from South Carolina. However, Randolph's reputation eventually was restored, and in 1828, the General Assembly created a new [[Randolph County, Georgia|Randolph County]].<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/coundate.htm GeorgiaInfo.com - Georgia Counties in Order of Creation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218012756/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/coundate.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}, University of Georgia</ref>\n\n[[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]] was created from a part of the original Jasper County in 1821.\n\nThe Jasper County, Georgia courthouse, was shown and used for filming the courthouse scenes in the motion picture comedy \"My Cousin Vinny\", starring Joe Pesci. Although the setting of the movie is in Beechum County, Alabama (a fictitious place), near the end of the movie, Sheriff Farley (played by veteran actor Bruce McGill), actually mentions Jasper County, Georgia by name.\n\n==Government==\nThe county has a five-member county commission, elected from single-member districts. The commission elects a chairman and vice-chairman to aid in conducting business.\nThe county is protected by a combined Fire Rescue Department providing EMS and Fire Services. The department operates out of 7 fire stations with the majority of their manpower being volunteers.
