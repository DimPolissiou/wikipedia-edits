Hosted by [[Jiminy Cricket]] along with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Tinker Bell]], the special combines newly produced animation with clips from vintage animated Disney shorts and feature films, presented to the viewer as \"Christmas cards\" from the various characters starring in each one.\n\nStarting in 1963 and continuing through the 1970s, re-airings of the special would include preview footage of the studio's new or upcoming feature films. Beginning in 1983, it was expanded to 90 minutes and retitled ''A Disney Channel Christmas'' for airing on cable television's [[The Disney Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html |title=Disney First Christmas Special |publisher=TVparty!}}</ref> A [[home video]] version of the special, retitled ''Jiminy Cricket's Christmas'', appeared on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], and [[laserdisc]] in 1986.\n\nThe show has been shown infrequently in the US in recent years, but in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) the show has been broadcast every year since 1959, and has become a holiday classic.

The original version included [[Walt Disney]]'s introduction where he has been cricket-sized, because, as Mickey and Jiminy would say, Christmas is bigger than all of them. The American version has been infrequently shown since 1980.\n\nThe original American version features the following shorts:\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Toy Tinkers]]'' (1949)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films, labeled in the special as \"Memorable Moments\":\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' - \"You Can Fly!\"\n*''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' - \"[[I've Got No Strings]]\"\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' - \"[[Bella Notte]]\"\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' - \"The Work Song\" / \"[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\"\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' - \"[[The Silly Song]]\"\n\nThe special ends with Jiminy Cricket sharing ''his'' memorable moment, his song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), which he states \"symbolizes faith, hope and all the things that Christmas stands for\". Starting in 1963 and continuing through the 1970s, all of the scenes with Walt and Tinker Bell's intros, as well as ''Santa's Workshop'', had been replaced by a teaser for Disney's new or upcoming feature films, including ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[The Aristocats]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Goofy's cartoon ''The Art of Skiing'' was added in the 1983 broadcast.\n\n== Denmark ==\n\nIn Denmark the show is called '''''Disneys Juleshow: Fra alle os til alle jer''''' (\"Disney's Christmas Show: From All of Us to All of You\") and is broadcast every Christmas Eve at 4 PM on [[DR1]].

It is broadcast on [[SVT1]] at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. as part of the channel's traditional Christmas Eve programming, including a live host, most prominently [[Arne Weise]] from 1972 through 2002. The title reflects the fact that Donald Duck is far more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]] in Sweden. The montage is narrated by [[Bengt Feldreich]], dubbing the original English voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]] ([[Cliff Edwards]]).<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" />\n\nThe special, which is typically referred to as simply ''Kalle Anka'' (Donald Duck), along with its characters and cartoons, are ingrained in Swedish pop culture as a Christmas tradition. The popularity of ''Kalle Anka'' in Sweden as a television event was influenced by several factors, including the fact that for the ten years since the special's original premiere in 1960<ref>https://www.kalleanka.se/ankeborgsposten/kalle-anka-och-hans-vanner-onskar-god-jul/</ref>, SVT1 was the only television channel in the country ([[SVT2]] launched in 1969), and even then, the country's public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television]] had a monopoly on television broadcasting until the 1987 launch of the country's [[TV3 (Sweden)|first commercial channel]]. At the time, it was also one of the few occasions that U.S.-produced animation was broadcast on Swedish television.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> ''Kalle Anka'' has remained one of the most-watched television specials in the country: usually drawing more than five million viewers up until the 1990s (in a country with then less than nine million inhabitants), and still drawing 3.3 million viewers in 2019 (when Sweden had over ten million inhabitants).<ref>https://www.svd.se/sa-manga-sag-kalle-anka-pa-julafton (Swedish)</ref>. \n\nDue to its legacy and prominence, the special has remained relatively unchanged (aside from each year promoting one or two new Disney films). The Swedish public has been protective of ''Kalle Anka'', resisting any significant changes to the special's content: in the 1970s, when SVT's head of children's programming disclosed plans to discontinue the special due to growing anti-commercial sentiment in the country, public outcry resulted in the special being maintained. A similar backlash was faced in 1982 when ''Ferdinand the Bull'' was replaced with ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''\u2014a change that was quickly reverted the following year.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 1992, Weise planned to pre-record his hosting segments so he could spend Christmas with his family, but backed down after receiving criticism for breaking the tradition of hosting it live.

Hosted by [[Jiminy Cricket]] along with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Tinker Bell]], the special combines newly produced animation with clips from vintage animated Disney shorts and feature films, presented to the viewer as \"Christmas cards\" from the various characters starring in each one.\n\nStarting in 1963 and continuing through the 1970s, re-airings of the special would include preview footage of the studio's new or upcoming feature films. Beginning in 1983, it was expanded to 90 minutes and retitled ''A Disney Channel Christmas'' for airing on cable television's [[The Disney Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html |title=Disney First Christmas Special |publisher=TVparty!}}</ref> A [[home video]] version of the special, retitled ''Jiminy Cricket's Christmas'', appeared on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], and [[laserdisc]] in 1986.\n\nThe show has been shown infrequently in the US in recent years, but in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) the show has been broadcast every year since 1959, and has become a holiday classic.

The original version included [[Walt Disney]]'s introduction where he has been cricket-sized, because, as Mickey and Jiminy would say, Christmas is bigger than all of them. The American version has been infrequently shown since 1980.\n\nThe original American version features the following shorts:\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Toy Tinkers]]'' (1949)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films, labeled in the special as \"Memorable Moments\":\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' - \"You Can Fly!\"\n*''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' - \"[[I've Got No Strings]]\"\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' - \"[[Bella Notte]]\"\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' - \"The Work Song\" / \"[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\"\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' - \"[[The Silly Song]]\"\n\nThe special ends with Jiminy Cricket sharing ''his'' memorable moment, his song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), which he states \"symbolizes faith, hope and all the things that Christmas stands for\". Starting in 1963 and continuing through the 1970s, all of the scenes with Walt and Tinker Bell's intros, as well as ''Santa's Workshop'', had been replaced by a teaser for Disney's new or upcoming feature films, including ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[The Aristocats]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Goofy's cartoon ''The Art of Skiing'' was added in the 1983 broadcast.\n\n== Denmark ==\n\nIn Denmark the show is called '''''Disneys Juleshow: Fra alle os til alle jer''''' (\"Disney's Christmas Show: From All of Us to All of You\") and is broadcast every Christmas Eve at 4 PM on [[DR1]]. It is narrated by Danish actor [[Ove Sprog\u00f8e]] who does the Danish voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]]. Clips from feature films are voiced in Danish while shorts are in English with Danish subtitles.\n\nThe Danish version features the following shorts:\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Donald's Snow Fight]]'' (1942)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films:\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[Bambi]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''\n*''[[The Aristocats]]''\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n\nIt ends with [[Bj\u00f8rn Tidmand]] singing \"[[When You Wish upon a Star]]\" in Danish (\"N\u00e5r Du Ser et Stjerneskud\") and a sneak peek of either an upcoming or a clip from a recently released Disney movie.\n\n== Finland ==\nIn Finland, this show is called '''''Samu Sirkan joulutervehdys''''', (\"[[Jiminy Cricket]]'s Christmas Greeting\") and it is shown every Christmas Eve evening on [[MTV3]].\n\nThe Finnish version features clips from the following shorts:\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (1952)\n*''[[The Clock Watcher]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Small One]]'' (1978)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films:\n*''[[The Three Caballeros]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n\nA special \"surprise\" clip (from a recent or upcoming Disney feature premiere) is dubbed in Finnish but everything else is in English, with Finnish subtitles.\n\n== Norway ==\nIn Norway, the show is called '''''Donald Duck og vennene hans''''' (\"[[Donald Duck]] and his friends\") on [[NRK]] and '''''Disneys julekavalkade''''' (Disney's Christmas [[Cavalcade]]) on [[TV Norge]] in 2003, and it is shown every Christmas Eve afternoon on NRK1. Most of the shorts are shown in their original English-speaking versions, with Norwegian subtitles.\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Bambi]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n\n== Sweden ==\nIn Sweden, the show is called '''''Kalle Anka och hans v\u00e4nner \u00f6nskar God Jul''''' (\"[[Donald Duck]] and His Friends Wish You a Merry Christmas\"). It is broadcast on [[SVT1]] at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. as part of the channel's traditional Christmas Eve programming, including a live host, most prominently [[Arne Weise]] from 1972 through 2002. The title reflects the fact that Donald Duck is far more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]] in Sweden. The montage is narrated by [[Bengt Feldreich]], dubbing the original English voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]] ([[Cliff Edwards]]).<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" />\n\nThe special, which is typically referred to as simply ''Kalle Anka'' (Donald Duck), along with its characters and cartoons, are ingrained in Swedish pop culture as a Christmas tradition. The popularity of ''Kalle Anka'' in Sweden as a television event was influenced by several factors, including the fact that for the ten years since the special's original premiere in 1960<ref>https://www.kalleanka.se/ankeborgsposten/kalle-anka-och-hans-vanner-onskar-god-jul/</ref>, SVT1 was the only television channel in the country ([[SVT2]] launched in 1969), and even then, the country's public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television]] had a monopoly on television broadcasting until the 1987 launch of the country's [[TV3 (Sweden)|first commercial channel]]. At the time, it was also one of the few occasions that U.S.-produced animation was broadcast on Swedish television.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> ''Kalle Anka'' has remained one of the most-watched television specials in the country: usually drawing more than five million viewers up until the 1990's (in a country with then less than nine million inhabitants), and still drawing 3.3 million viewers in 2019 (when Sweden had over ten million inhabitants).<ref>https://www.svd.se/sa-manga-sag-kalle-anka-pa-julafton (Swedish)</ref>. \n\nDue to its legacy and prominence, the special has remained relatively unchanged (aside from each year promoting one or two new Disney films). The Swedish public has been protective of ''Kalle Anka'', resisting any significant changes to the special's content: in the 1970s, when SVT's head of children's programming disclosed plans to discontinue the special due to growing anti-commercial sentiment in the country, public outcry resulted in the special being maintained. A similar backlash was faced in 1982 when ''Ferdinand the Bull'' was replaced with ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''\u2014a change that was quickly reverted the following year.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 1992, Weise planned to pre-record his hosting segments so he could spend Christmas with his family, but backed down after receiving criticism for breaking the tradition of hosting it live. In a 2007 interview, Weise quipped that hosting the special had affected his personal life, stating that he had three [[divorce]]s as a result of it.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 2012, Disney decided to edit the ''Santa's Workshop'' segment, removing \"cultural stereotypes\",<ref>https://www.svt.se/kultur/film/disney-censurerar-i-kalle-ankas-jul</ref> that had been restored to the episode in 1983, provoking another public debate.<ref>https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/60-%C3%A5r-av-%C3%A4ndringar-s%C3%A5-har-kalle-ankas-jul-gjorts-om-1.21651167</ref>\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n*''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Number of viewers (according to Mediam\u00e4tning i Skandinavien).<ref>http://hottoptv.mms.se/hottop.asp</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Viewers\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 2017 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2016 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2015 || 3 460 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2014 || 3 705 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2013 || 3 570 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2012 || 3 883 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2011 || 3 495 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2010 || 3 356 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2009 || 3 294 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2008 || 3 215 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 490 000<ref>Svenska Dagbladet on 28 December 2007</ref> || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2006 || 3 610 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2005 || 3 515 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2004 || 3 685 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2003 || 3 410 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2002 || 3 655 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2001 || 3 825 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2000 || 3 565 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1999 || 4 165 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1998 || 3 599 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1997 || 4 319 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1996 || 4 124 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1995 || 3 880 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1994 || 3 223 000 || Third most popular show of the year (1: Melodifestivalen 19940227, 2: Winter Olympics 19940312)\n|}\n\n== Russia ==\nIn Russia, this show is called '''''\u0421 \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0430!'''''

The seasonally flooded [[Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests]] lie inland from the mangrove forests on the coastal fringe. The forest covers {{convert|10000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of which about {{convert|6,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} are in Bangladesh. It became inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage]] site in [1987].\nThe Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about {{convert|4,110|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, of which about {{convert|1700|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} is occupied by water bodies in the forms of river, canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres.\n\nThe Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of [[tide|tidal]] waterways, [[mudflat]]s and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost every corner of the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris''), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, [[chital|spotted deer]], [[crocodile]]s and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Khulna]] and [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] against the floods that result from the [[cyclone]]s. The Sundarbans has also been enlisted among the finalists in the [[New7Wonders of Nature]].\n\n==Physiography==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Sundarbans SPOT 1219.jpg\n| caption1 = [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]] image of Sundarbans, released by [[CNES]]\n| width1 = 172\n| image2 = Sundarbans.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Landsat 7]] image of Sundarbans, released by [[NASA Earth Observatory]]\n| width2 = 256\n}}\n\nThe mangrove-dominated [[Ganges Delta]] \u2013 the Sundarbans \u2013 is a complex [[ecosystem]] comprising one of the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of the world. Larger part is situated in Bangladesh, a smaller portion of it lies in India. The Indian part of the forest is estimated to be about 40 percent, while the Bangladeshi part is 60 percent. To the south the forest meets the Bay of Bengal; to the east it is bordered by the [[Baleswar River]] and to the north there is a sharp interface with intensively cultivated land. The natural drainage in the upstream areas, other than the main river channels, is everywhere impeded by extensive embankments and [[polder]]s. The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about {{convert|16700|km2|mi2}}. Now it has dwindled into about 1/3 of the original size. The total land area today is {{convert|4143|km2|mi2}}, including exposed [[sandbar]]s with a total area of {{convert|42|km2|mi2}}; the remaining water area of {{convert|1874|km2|mi2}} encompasses rivers, small streams and canals. Rivers in the Sundarbans are meeting places of salt water and freshwater. Thus, it is a region of transition between the freshwater of the rivers originating from the Ganges and the saline water of the Bay of Bengal.<ref name=Wahid/>\n\nThe Sundarbans along the Bay of Bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation. The physiography is dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees, splays and tidal flats. There are also marginal marshes above mean tide level, tidal sandbars and islands with their networks of tidal channels, subaqueous distal bars and proto-delta clays and silt sediments. The Sundarbans' floor varies from {{convert|0.9|to|2.11|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>Katebi, M.N.A. and Habib, M.G. (1987).

The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays a significant role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop [[micromorphological]] features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] dunes is controlled by an abundance of [[xerophytic]] and [[halophytic]] plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Ari |date=20 May 2016 |title=Rising Tides Force Thousands To Leave Islands Of Eastern India |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/20/478915685/rising-tides-force-thousands-to-leave-islands-of-eastern-india |publisher=NPR |access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.\n\n{{see also|List of rivers of Sundarbans}}\n\n==Ecoregions==\nSundarbans features two [[ecoregion]]s \u2014 \"Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests\" (IM0162) and \"Sundarbans mangroves\" (IM1406).<ref>[http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm Ecoregions: Indo-Malayan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628180622/http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm |date=28 June 2009 }}, [[World Wildlife Fund]]</ref>\n\n===Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests===\nThe Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of Bangladesh.

Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as [[pneumatophore]]s, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. [[Fishing cat]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[wild boar]]s, common grey mongooses, foxes, [[jungle cat]]s, [[flying fox]]es, [[pangolin]]s, and [[spotted deer]] are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.\n\nA 1991 study has revealed that the Indian part of the Sundarbans supports diverse biological resources including at least 150 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species, although new ones are being discovered. This represents a significant proportion of the species present in Bangladesh (i.e. about 30% of the reptiles, 37% the birds and 34% of the mammals) and includes many species which are now extinct elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=D.

Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times<ref name=hussain/> and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and management of wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024639/http://www.nishorgo.org/nishorgo/wildlife_Act/Amended_Wildlife_Order_Eng.pdf THE ORIGINAL BANGLADESH WILDLIFE PRESERVATION ORDER 1973 THE DRAFT]. nishorgo.org</ref>\n\n===Mammals===\nThe fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining.

This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the [[chital]] deer (''Axis axis''), [[Indian muntjac]]s (''Muntiacus muntjak''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), and [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''). It is estimated that there are now 180 Bengal tigers<ref name=\"tg27Jul2015\" /> and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30\u2013100 per year.<ref>{{Cite iucn |author1=Goodrich, J. |author2=Lynam, A. |author3=Miquelle, D. |author4=Wibisono, H. |author5=Kawanishi, K. |author6=Pattanavibool, A. |author7=Htun, S. |author8=Tempa, T. |author9=Karki, J. |author10=Jhala, Y. & Karanth, U. |title=''Panthera tigris'' |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |volume=2015 |page=e.T15955A50659951 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2015 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-2.RLTS.T15955A50659951.en}}</ref>\n\n===Avifauna===\nThe forest is also rich in bird life, with 286 species including the endemic [[brown-winged kingfisher]]s (''Pelargopsis amauroptera'') and the globally threatened [[lesser adjutant]]s (''Leptoptilos javanicus'') and [[masked finfoot]]s (''Heliopais personata'') and birds of prey such as the [[osprey]]s (''Pandion haliaetus''), [[white-bellied sea eagle]]s (''Haliaeetus leucogaster'') and [[grey-headed fish eagle]]s (''Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus'').

The shore currents vary greatly along with the [[monsoon]]. These are also affected by [[cyclonic]] action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One of the greatest challenges people living on the [[Ganges Delta]] may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by [[subsidence]] in the region and partly by climate change.\n\nIn many of the Bangladesh's mangrove wetlands, freshwater reaching the mangroves was considerably reduced from the 1970s because of diversion of freshwater in the upstream area by neighbouring [[India]] through the use of the [[Farakka Barrage]] bordering [[Rajshahi]], Bangladesh. Also, the Bengal [[Drainage basin|Basin]] is slowly tilting towards the east because of neo-[[tectonic]] movement, forcing greater freshwater input to the Bangladesh Sundarbans. As a result, the salinity of the Bangladesh Sundarbans is much lower than that of the Indian side. A 1990 study noted that there \"is no evidence that environmental degradation in the [[Himalayas]] or a 'greenhouse' induced rise in sea level have aggravated floods in Bangladesh\"; however, a 2007 report by UNESCO, \"Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage\" has stated that an anthropogenic {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} rise in sea level (likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75&nbsp;percent of the Sundarbans mangroves.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/documents/publi_climatechange.pdf Case Studies of Climate Change], UNESCO, 2007</ref> Already, [[Lohachara Island]] and [[South Talpatti Island|New Moore Island/South Talpatti Island]] have disappeared under the sea, and [[Ghoramara Island]] is half submerged.<ref>{{cite news |last=George |first=Nirmala |date=24 March 2010 |title=Disputed isle in Bay of Bengal disappears into sea |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |newspaper=Yahoo News |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329164736/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |archive-date=29 March 2010 |access-date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a study conducted in 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found out that the Sunderban coast was retreating up to {{convert|200|m}} in a year. Agricultural activities had destroyed around {{convert|17,179|ha}} of mangroves within three decades (1975\u20132010). Shrimp cultivation had destroyed another {{convert|7,554|ha}}.\n\nResearches from the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University, estimated the annual rise in sea level to be {{convert|8|mm}} in 2010.

This, coupled with an around {{convert|1.5|C-change}} rise in surface water temperatures and increased levels of salinity have posed a problem for the survival of the indigenous flora and fauna. The Sundari trees are exceptionally sensitive to salinity and are being threatened with extinction.\n\nLoss of the mangrove forest will result in the loss of the protective biological shield against cyclones and tsunamis. This may put the surrounding coastal communities at high risk. Moreover, the submergence of land mass have rendered up to 6,000 families homeless and around 70,000 people are immediately threatened with the same.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mangrove forests threatened by Climate Change in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India|url=http://takvera.blogspot.in/2013/01/mangrove-forests-threatened-by-climate.html|date=12 January 2013}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Warming: Rising Seas creates 70,000 Climate Refugees|url=http://takvera.blogspot.com.au/2006/12/global-warming-rising-seas-creates.html|date=27 December 2006}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}<!-- A self-published blog is not a reliable source.

It is the single largest source of [[forest produce]] in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, fuelwood, pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, [[honey]], beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.\n\nThe forest has immense protective and productive functions. Constituting 51% of the total [[Reserve forest|reserved forest estate]] of Bangladesh, it contributes about 41% of total forest revenue and accounts for about 45% of all timber and fuel wood output of the country.<ref name=FAO95/> A number of industries (e.g., newsprint mill, match factory, hardboard, boat building, furniture making) are based on raw materials obtained from the Sundarbans ecosystem. [[Non-timber forest product]]s and [[plantation]]s help generate considerable employment and income opportunities for at least half a million poor coastal people. It provides natural protection to life and properties of the coastal population in [[cyclone]]-prone Bangladesh.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Flooded rice fields in monsoon.jpg|thumb|During monsoon the [[paddy field]]s in the Sunderbans are entirely flooded.]]\nPart of the Sundarbans is shielded from tidal inflow by leaves and there one finds villages and agriculture. During the [[monsoon]] season,  the low lying agricultural lands are waterlogged and the summer crop (''[[kharif crop]]'') is therefore mainly [[deepwater rice]] or floating rice. In the dry winter season the land is normally uncropped and used for cattle grazing. However, the lands near the villages are irrigated from ponds that were filled up during monsoon, and vegetable crops (''[[Rabi crop]]s'') can be grown here.<ref>H.S.Sen, 1992. ''Research on water management in the Sundarbans, West Bengal, India.'' Published in the Annual Report 1992 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and improvement, Wageningen, the Netherlands. On line:[https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/sunderbans.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Habitation===\nThe Sundarbans has a population of over 4 million<ref name=BBCSubir>{{cite news |author=Subir Bhaumik |title=Fears rise for sinking Sundarbans |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3102948.stm |work=BBC News |date=15 September 2003}}</ref> but much of it is mostly free of permanent human habitation. Despite human habitations and a century of economic exploitation of the forest well into the late 1940s, the Sundarbans retained a forest closure of about 70% according to the [[Department for International Development|Overseas Development Administration]] (ODA) of the United Kingdom in 1979.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Sundarban police boat.jpg|thumb|Police Boat Patrolling in [[Sundarban National Park]], West Bengal]]\n\nThe Sundarbans area is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and the population is increasing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still is one of the largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways.\n\nThe Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. The [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF), Wildlife & Bio-Diversity & ex-officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) & Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a Deputy Field Director and an Assistant Field Director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers.\n\nThe park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the [[Project Tiger]] from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as a preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the [[World Heritage Fund]].\n\nA new Khulna Forest Circle was created in Bangladesh back in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. The direct administrative head of the Division is the Divisional Forest Officer, based at Khulna, who has a number of professional, subprofessional and support staff and logistic supports for the implementation of necessary management and administrative activities. The basic unit of management is the compartment. There are 55 compartments in four Forest Ranges and these are clearly demarcated mainly by natural features such as rivers, canals and creeks.\n\n===Protection===\n[[File:Sunderbans map.png|thumb|right|254x254px|A map of the protected areas of the Indian Sunderbans, showing the boundaries of the tiger reserve, the national park and the three wildlife sanctuaries, conservation and lodging centres, subsistence towns, and access points. The entire forested (dark green) area constitutes the Biosphere Reserve, with the remaining forests outside the national park and wildlife sanctuaries being given the status of a [[reserve forest]].]]\n\nThe Bangladesh part of the forest lies under two forest divisions, and four administrative ranges viz Chandpai (Khulna District), [[Sarankhola]] (Khulna), and [[Burigoalini]] ([[Satkhira District]]) and has sixteen forest stations. It is further divided into fifty-five compartments and nine blocks.<ref name=\"Bpedia\"/> There are three wildlife sanctuaries established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973). The West Bengal part of the forest lies under the district of South & North 24 Parganas.\n\nProtected areas cover 15% of the Sundarbans mangroves including [[Sundarbans National Park]] and [[Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary]], in West Bengal, [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuaries]] in Bangladesh.<ref name=IM1406/>\n\nIn May 2019, the local authorities in Bangladesh killed 4 tiger poachers in a shootout in the Sunderbans mangrove area where currently 114 tigers dwell.\n\n====Sundarban National Park====\n{{main|Sundarbans National Park}}\nThe Sundarban National Park is a [[National Park]], [[Tiger Reserve]], and a [[Biosphere Reserve]] in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the [[Ganges Delta]], and adjacent to the Sundarbans Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The [[River delta|delta]] is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the [[Bengal tiger]]. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and [[invertebrate]] species, including the [[salt-water crocodile]]. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a National Park.\n\n====Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region supports mangroves, including: sparse stands of Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and dense stands of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal''), with discontinuous patches of Hantal palm (''[[Phoenix paludosa]]'') on drier ground, river banks and levees. The fauna of the sanctuary is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are [[wild boar]], chital horin ([[spotted deer]]), Indian otter and [[macaque monkey]]. Five species of marine turtles frequent the coastal zone and two endangered reptiles are present \u2013 the [[estuarine crocodile]] and the [[Indian python]].<ref>UNESCO World Heritage Nomination, 1997</ref>\n\n====Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|31227|ha|acre}}. Sundari trees (''Heritiera fomes'') dominate the flora, interspersed with Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and Passur (''Xylocarpus mekongensis'') with Kankra (''[[Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]'') occurring in areas subject to more frequent flooding. There is an understory of Shingra (''Cynometra ramiflora'') where, soils are drier and Amur (''Aglaia cucullata'') in wetter areas and Goran (''[[Ceriops]] decandra'') in more saline places. Nypa palm (''Nypa fruticans'') is widespread along drainage lines.\n\n====Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|36970|ha|acre}}. There is evidently the greatest seasonal variation in salinity levels and possibly represents an area of relatively longer duration of moderate salinity where Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') is the dominant woody species. It is often mixed with Sundri, which is able to displace in circumstances such as artificially opened canopies where Sundri does not regenerate as effectively. It is also frequently associated with a dense understory of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal'') and sometimes Passur.\n\n====Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary ====\n{{main|Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{convert|362|km2|mi2|adj=on}} area in the northern part of the Sundarbans delta in [[South 24 Parganas district]], West Bengal, India. It is mainly mangrove scrub, forest and swamp. It was set up as a sanctuary in 1976. It is home to a rich population of different species of wildlife, such as [[water fowl]], [[heron]], [[pelican]], [[Chital|spotted deer]], [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[wild boar]], tigers, [[Asian water monitor|water monitor lizards]], [[fishing cat]]s, [[otter]]s, [[olive ridley turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[Batagur baska|batagur terrapins]], and migratory birds.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = G\u00f6ttin Manasa in Lehm.jpg\n| caption1 = Idol of [[Manasa]], the deity of snakes\n| width1 = 150\n| image2 = Banbibi.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Bonbibi]], the goddess of Sundarbans\n| width2 = 153\n}}\n\nThe Sundarbans is celebrated through numerous Bengali folk songs and dances, often centred around the folk heroes, gods and goddesses specific to the Sunderbans (like [[Bonbibi]] and [[Dakshin Rai]]) and to the Lower Gangetic Delta (like [[Manasa]] and [[Chand Sadagar]]). The Bengali folk epic [[Manasamangal]] mentions ''Netidhopani'' and has some passages set in the Sundarbans during the heroine [[Behula]]'s quest to bring her husband ''Lakhindar'' back to life.\n\nThe area provides the setting for several novels by [[Emilio Salgari]], (e.g. ''[[The Mystery of the Black Jungle]]''). ''Sundarbaney Arjan Sardar'', a novel by Shibshankar Mitra, and ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'', a novel by [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], are based on the rigors of lives of villagers and fishermen living in the Sunderbans region, and are woven into the Bengali psyche to a great extent. Part of the plot of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s [[Booker Prize]] winning novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' is set in the Sundarbans. This forest is adopted as the setting of [[Kunal Basu]]'s short story \"The Japanese Wife\" and the subsequent [[The Japanese Wife|film adaptation]]. Most of the plot of an internationally acclaimed novelist, [[Amitav Ghosh]]'s 2004 novel, ''[[The Hungry Tide]]'', is set in the Sundarbans. The plot centres on a headstrong American cetologist who arrives to study a rare species of river dolphin, enlisting a local fisherman and translator to aid her. The book also mentions two accounts of the Bonbibi story of \"Dukhey's Redemption\".<ref>Ghosh, Amitav (2005).

The seasonally flooded [[Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests]] lie inland from the mangrove forests on the coastal fringe. The forest covers {{convert|10000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of which about {{convert|6,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} are in Bangladesh. It became inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage]] site in [1987].\nThe Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about {{convert|4,110|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, of which about {{convert|1700|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} is occupied by water bodies in the forms of river, canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres.\n\nThe Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of [[tide|tidal]] waterways, [[mudflat]]s and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost every corner of the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris''), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, [[chital|spotted deer]], [[crocodile]]s and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Khulna]] and [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] against the floods that result from the [[cyclone]]s. The Sundarbans has also been enlisted among the finalists in the [[New7Wonders of Nature]].\n\n==Physiography==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Sundarbans SPOT 1219.jpg\n| caption1 = [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]] image of Sundarbans, released by [[CNES]]\n| width1 = 172\n| image2 = Sundarbans.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Landsat 7]] image of Sundarbans, released by [[NASA Earth Observatory]]\n| width2 = 256\n}}\n\nThe mangrove-dominated [[Ganges Delta]] \u2013 the Sundarbans \u2013 is a complex [[ecosystem]] comprising one of the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of the world. Larger part is situated in Bangladesh, a smaller portion of it lies in India. The Indian part of the forest is estimated to be about 40 percent, while the Bangladeshi part is 60 percent. To the south the forest meets the Bay of Bengal; to the east it is bordered by the [[Baleswar River]] and to the north there is a sharp interface with intensively cultivated land. The natural drainage in the upstream areas, other than the main river channels, is everywhere impeded by extensive embankments and [[polder]]s. The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about {{convert|16700|km2|mi2}}. Now it has dwindled into about 1/3 of the original size. The total land area today is {{convert|4143|km2|mi2}}, including exposed [[sandbar]]s with a total area of {{convert|42|km2|mi2}}; the remaining water area of {{convert|1874|km2|mi2}} encompasses rivers, small streams and canals. Rivers in the Sundarbans are meeting places of salt water and freshwater. Thus, it is a region of transition between the freshwater of the rivers originating from the Ganges and the saline water of the Bay of Bengal.<ref name=Wahid/>\n\nThe Sundarbans along the Bay of Bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation. The physiography is dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees, splays and tidal flats. There are also marginal marshes above mean tide level, tidal sandbars and islands with their networks of tidal channels, subaqueous distal bars and proto-delta clays and silt sediments. The Sundarbans' floor varies from {{convert|0.9|to|2.11|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>Katebi, M.N.A. and Habib, M.G. (1987).

The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays a significant role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop [[micromorphological]] features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] dunes is controlled by an abundance of [[xerophytic]] and [[halophytic]] plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Ari |date=20 May 2016 |title=Rising Tides Force Thousands To Leave Islands Of Eastern India |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/20/478915685/rising-tides-force-thousands-to-leave-islands-of-eastern-india |publisher=NPR |access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.\n\n{{see also|List of rivers of Sundarbans}}\n\n==Ecoregions==\nSundarbans features two [[ecoregion]]s \u2014 \"Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests\" (IM0162) and \"Sundarbans mangroves\" (IM1406).<ref>[http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm Ecoregions: Indo-Malayan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628180622/http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm |date=28 June 2009 }}, [[World Wildlife Fund]]</ref>\n\n===Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests===\nThe Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of Bangladesh.

Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as [[pneumatophore]]s, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. [[Fishing cat]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[wild boar]]s, common grey mongooses, foxes, [[jungle cat]]s, [[flying fox]]es, [[pangolin]]s, and [[spotted deer]] are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.\n\nA 1991 study has revealed that the Indian part of the Sundarbans supports diverse biological resources including at least 150 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species, although new ones are being discovered. This represents a significant proportion of the species present in Bangladesh (i.e. about 30% of the reptiles, 37% the birds and 34% of the mammals) and includes many species which are now extinct elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=D.

Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times<ref name=hussain/> and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and management of wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024639/http://www.nishorgo.org/nishorgo/wildlife_Act/Amended_Wildlife_Order_Eng.pdf THE ORIGINAL BANGLADESH WILDLIFE PRESERVATION ORDER 1973 THE DRAFT]. nishorgo.org</ref>\n\n===Mammals===\nThe fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining.

This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the [[chital]] deer (''Axis axis''), [[Indian muntjac]]s (''Muntiacus muntjak''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), and [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''). It is estimated that there are now 180 Bengal tigers<ref name=\"tg27Jul2015\" /> and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30\u2013100 per year.<ref>{{Cite iucn |author1=Goodrich, J. |author2=Lynam, A. |author3=Miquelle, D. |author4=Wibisono, H. |author5=Kawanishi, K. |author6=Pattanavibool, A. |author7=Htun, S. |author8=Tempa, T. |author9=Karki, J. |author10=Jhala, Y. & Karanth, U. |title=''Panthera tigris'' |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |volume=2015 |page=e.T15955A50659951 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2015 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-2.RLTS.T15955A50659951.en}}</ref>\n\n===Avifauna===\nThe forest is also rich in bird life, with 286 species including the endemic [[brown-winged kingfisher]]s (''Pelargopsis amauroptera'') and the globally threatened [[lesser adjutant]]s (''Leptoptilos javanicus'') and [[masked finfoot]]s (''Heliopais personata'') and birds of prey such as the [[osprey]]s (''Pandion haliaetus''), [[white-bellied sea eagle]]s (''Haliaeetus leucogaster'') and [[grey-headed fish eagle]]s (''Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus'').

The shore currents vary greatly along with the [[monsoon]]. These are also affected by [[cyclonic]] action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One of the greatest challenges people living on the [[Ganges Delta]] may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by [[subsidence]] in the region and partly by climate change.\n\nIn many of the Bangladesh's mangrove wetlands, freshwater reaching the mangroves was considerably reduced from the 1970s because of diversion of freshwater in the upstream area by neighbouring [[India]] through the use of the [[Farakka Barrage]] bordering [[Rajshahi]], Bangladesh. Also, the Bengal [[Drainage basin|Basin]] is slowly tilting towards the east because of neo-[[tectonic]] movement, forcing greater freshwater input to the Bangladesh Sundarbans. As a result, the salinity of the Bangladesh Sundarbans is much lower than that of the Indian side. A 1990 study noted that there \"is no evidence that environmental degradation in the [[Himalayas]] or a 'greenhouse' induced rise in sea level have aggravated floods in Bangladesh\"; however, a 2007 report by UNESCO, \"Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage\" has stated that an anthropogenic {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} rise in sea level (likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75&nbsp;percent of the Sundarbans mangroves.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/documents/publi_climatechange.pdf Case Studies of Climate Change], UNESCO, 2007</ref> Already, [[Lohachara Island]] and [[South Talpatti Island|New Moore Island/South Talpatti Island]] have disappeared under the sea, and [[Ghoramara Island]] is half submerged.<ref>{{cite news |last=George |first=Nirmala |date=24 March 2010 |title=Disputed isle in Bay of Bengal disappears into sea |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |newspaper=Yahoo News |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329164736/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |archive-date=29 March 2010 |access-date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a study conducted in 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found out that the Sunderban coast was retreating up to {{convert|200|m}} in a year. Agricultural activities had destroyed around {{convert|17,179|ha}} of mangroves within three decades (1975\u20132010). Shrimp cultivation had destroyed another {{convert|7,554|ha}}.\n\nResearches from the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University, estimated the annual rise in sea level to be {{convert|8|mm}} in 2010.

This, coupled with an around {{convert|1.5|C-change}} rise in surface water temperatures and increased levels of salinity have posed a problem for the survival of the indigenous flora and fauna. The Sundari trees are exceptionally sensitive to salinity and are being threatened with extinction.\n\nLoss of the mangrove forest will result in the loss of the protective biological shield against cyclones and tsunamis. This may put the surrounding coastal communities at high risk. Moreover, the submergence of land mass have rendered up to 6,000 families homeless and around 70,000 people are immediately threatened with the same.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mangrove forests threatened by Climate Change in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India|url=http://takvera.blogspot.in/2013/01/mangrove-forests-threatened-by-climate.html|date=12 January 2013}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Warming: Rising Seas creates 70,000 Climate Refugees|url=http://takvera.blogspot.com.au/2006/12/global-warming-rising-seas-creates.html|date=27 December 2006}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}<!-- A self-published blog is not a reliable source.

It is the single largest source of [[forest produce]] in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, fuelwood, pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, [[honey]], beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.\n\nThe forest has immense protective and productive functions. Constituting 51% of the total [[Reserve forest|reserved forest estate]] of Bangladesh, it contributes about 41% of total forest revenue and accounts for about 45% of all timber and fuel wood output of the country.<ref name=FAO95/> A number of industries (e.g., newsprint mill, match factory, hardboard, boat building, furniture making) are based on raw materials obtained from the Sundarbans ecosystem. [[Non-timber forest product]]s and [[plantation]]s help generate considerable employment and income opportunities for at least half a million poor coastal people. It provides natural protection to life and properties of the coastal population in [[cyclone]]-prone Bangladesh.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Flooded rice fields in monsoon.jpg|thumb|During monsoon the [[paddy field]]s in the Sunderbans are entirely flooded.]]\nPart of the Sundarbans is shielded from tidal inflow by leaves and there one finds villages and agriculture. During the [[monsoon]] season,  the low lying agricultural lands are waterlogged and the summer crop (''[[kharif crop]]'') is therefore mainly [[deepwater rice]] or floating rice. In the dry winter season the land is normally uncropped and used for cattle grazing. However, the lands near the villages are irrigated from ponds that were filled up during monsoon, and vegetable crops (''[[Rabi crop]]s'') can be grown here.<ref>H.S.Sen, 1992.

Despite human habitations and a century of economic exploitation of the forest well into the late 1940s, the Sundarbans retained a forest closure of about 70% according to the [[Department for International Development|Overseas Development Administration]] (ODA) of the United Kingdom in 1979.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Sundarban police boat.jpg|thumb|Police Boat Patrolling in [[Sundarban National Park]], West Bengal]]\n\nThe Sundarbans area is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and the population is increasing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still is one of the largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways.\n\nThe Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. The [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF), Wildlife & Bio-Diversity & ex-officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) & Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a Deputy Field Director and an Assistant Field Director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers.\n\nThe park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the [[Project Tiger]] from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as a preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the [[World Heritage Fund]].\n\nA new Khulna Forest Circle was created in Bangladesh back in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. The direct administrative head of the Division is the Divisional Forest Officer, based at Khulna, who has a number of professional, subprofessional and support staff and logistic supports for the implementation of necessary management and administrative activities. The basic unit of management is the compartment. There are 55 compartments in four Forest Ranges and these are clearly demarcated mainly by natural features such as rivers, canals and creeks.\n\n===Protection===\n[[File:Sunderbans map.png|thumb|right|254x254px|A map of the protected areas of the Indian Sunderbans, showing the boundaries of the tiger reserve, the national park and the three wildlife sanctuaries, conservation and lodging centres, subsistence towns, and access points. The entire forested (dark green) area constitutes the Biosphere Reserve, with the remaining forests outside the national park and wildlife sanctuaries being given the status of a [[reserve forest]].]]\n\nThe Bangladesh part of the forest lies under two forest divisions, and four administrative ranges viz Chandpai (Khulna District), [[Sarankhola]] (Khulna), and [[Burigoalini]] ([[Satkhira District]]) and has sixteen forest stations. It is further divided into fifty-five compartments and nine blocks.<ref name=\"Bpedia\"/> There are three wildlife sanctuaries established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973). The West Bengal part of the forest lies under the district of South & North 24 Parganas.\n\nProtected areas cover 15% of the Sundarbans mangroves including [[Sundarbans National Park]] and [[Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary]], in West Bengal, [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuaries]] in Bangladesh.<ref name=IM1406/>\n\nIn May 2019, the local authorities in Bangladesh killed 4 tiger poachers in a shootout in the Sunderbans mangrove area where currently 114 tigers dwell.\n\n====Sundarban National Park====\n{{main|Sundarbans National Park}}\nThe Sundarban National Park is a [[National Park]], [[Tiger Reserve]], and a [[Biosphere Reserve]] in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the [[Ganges Delta]], and adjacent to the Sundarbans Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The [[River delta|delta]] is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the [[Bengal tiger]]. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and [[invertebrate]] species, including the [[salt-water crocodile]]. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a National Park.\n\n====Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region supports mangroves, including: sparse stands of Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and dense stands of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal''), with discontinuous patches of Hantal palm (''[[Phoenix paludosa]]'') on drier ground, river banks and levees. The fauna of the sanctuary is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are [[wild boar]], chital horin ([[spotted deer]]), Indian otter and [[macaque monkey]]. Five species of marine turtles frequent the coastal zone and two endangered reptiles are present \u2013 the [[estuarine crocodile]] and the [[Indian python]].<ref>UNESCO World Heritage Nomination, 1997</ref>\n\n====Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|31227|ha|acre}}. Sundari trees (''Heritiera fomes'') dominate the flora, interspersed with Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and Passur (''Xylocarpus mekongensis'') with Kankra (''[[Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]'') occurring in areas subject to more frequent flooding. There is an understory of Shingra (''Cynometra ramiflora'') where, soils are drier and Amur (''Aglaia cucullata'') in wetter areas and Goran (''[[Ceriops]] decandra'') in more saline places. Nypa palm (''Nypa fruticans'') is widespread along drainage lines.\n\n====Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary====\n{{main|Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|36970|ha|acre}}. There is evidently the greatest seasonal variation in salinity levels and possibly represents an area of relatively longer duration of moderate salinity where Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') is the dominant woody species. It is often mixed with Sundri, which is able to displace in circumstances such as artificially opened canopies where Sundri does not regenerate as effectively. It is also frequently associated with a dense understory of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal'') and sometimes Passur.\n\n====Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary ====\n{{main|Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary}}\nSajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{convert|362|km2|mi2|adj=on}} area in the northern part of the Sundarbans delta in [[South 24 Parganas district]], West Bengal, India. It is mainly mangrove scrub, forest and swamp. It was set up as a sanctuary in 1976. It is home to a rich population of different species of wildlife, such as [[water fowl]], [[heron]], [[pelican]], [[Chital|spotted deer]], [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[wild boar]], tigers, [[Asian water monitor|water monitor lizards]], [[fishing cat]]s, [[otter]]s, [[olive ridley turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[Batagur baska|batagur terrapins]], and migratory birds.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = G\u00f6ttin Manasa in Lehm.jpg\n| caption1 = Idol of [[Manasa]], the deity of snakes\n| width1 = 150\n| image2 = Banbibi.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Bonbibi]], the goddess of Sundarbans\n| width2 = 153\n}}\n\nThe Sundarbans is celebrated through numerous Bengali folk songs and dances, often centred around the folk heroes, gods and goddesses specific to the Sunderbans (like [[Bonbibi]] and [[Dakshin Rai]]) and to the Lower Gangetic Delta (like [[Manasa]] and [[Chand Sadagar]]). The Bengali folk epic [[Manasamangal]] mentions ''Netidhopani'' and has some passages set in the Sundarbans during the heroine [[Behula]]'s quest to bring her husband ''Lakhindar'' back to life.\n\nThe area provides the setting for several novels by [[Emilio Salgari]], (e.g. ''[[The Mystery of the Black Jungle]]''). ''Sundarbaney Arjan Sardar'', a novel by Shibshankar Mitra, and ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'', a novel by [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], are based on the rigors of lives of villagers and fishermen living in the Sunderbans region, and are woven into the Bengali psyche to a great extent. Part of the plot of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s [[Booker Prize]] winning novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' is set in the Sundarbans. This forest is adopted as the setting of [[Kunal Basu]]'s short story \"The Japanese Wife\" and the subsequent [[The Japanese Wife|film adaptation]]. Most of the plot of an internationally acclaimed novelist, [[Amitav Ghosh]]'s 2004 novel, ''[[The Hungry Tide]]'', is set in the Sundarbans. The plot centres on a headstrong American cetologist who arrives to study a rare species of river dolphin, enlisting a local fisherman and translator to aid her. The book also mentions two accounts of the Bonbibi story of \"Dukhey's Redemption\".<ref>Ghosh, Amitav (2005).

The original speed limit on the line was {{convert|30|km/h|sp=us}}, giving a travel time of three hours from Malm\u00f6 to Ystad. At Ystad, the line connected to the \u00d6sterlen Line, which had opened in 1965. The two lines were merged into a common operating company, Ystads J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar.<ref name=jarnvag />\n\nThe Ystad Line was [[nationalized]] in 1941. [[Diesel multiple unit]]s were taken into use in the 1950s. In 1955, the line through Malm\u00f6 was moved, so instead of operating out of [[Malm\u00f6 West Station]] via [[S\u00f6derv\u00e4rn]], the line connected to the Continental Line. The last steam train ran in 1962. During the 1960s and 1970s, several of the smaller stations, including all the manor station, were closed. The line was moved in 1973 to run via [[Fosieby]] and the following year, the [[train ferry]] between Ystad and [[Swinoujscie]] in Poland opened, and the line received a large increase in freight trains. The line was [[railway electrification system|electrified]] during the 1990's, and the first electricity-powered train ran across the tracks on 8 June 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jarnvag.net/banguide/malmo-ystad|title=Ystadbanan|publisher=J\u00e4rnv\u00e4g|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> The electrification resulted in increased traffic, and in 2003 a new [[passing loop]] was built at [[Rydsg\u00e5rd]] to allow increased traffic.<ref name=jarnvag />\n\n==Service==\nThe line has mixed passenger and freight traffic.
