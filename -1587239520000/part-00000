The attack was directed against trains passing through [[Kasumigaseki]] and [[Nagatach\u014d, Tokyo|Nagatach\u014d]], where the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] (Japanese parliament) is headquartered in Tokyo.\n\nThe group, led by [[Shoko Asahara]], had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, including the [[Matsumoto sarin attack]] nine months earlier. They had also produced several other nerve agents, including [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], and attempted to produce [[botulinum toxin]] and had perpetrated several failed acts of [[bioterrorism]]. Asahara had been made aware of a police raid scheduled for March 22 and had planned the Tokyo subway attack in order to hinder police investigations into the cult and perhaps spark the [[apocalypse]] they believed in.  The Leader Also wanted to start a Third World War.\n\nIn the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. Police activity continued throughout the summer, and over 200 members were arrested, including Asahara. Thirteen of the senior Aum management were sentenced to death and later executed; many others were given prison sentences up to life.

In 1987, the group rebranded and established a [[New York City|New York]] branch; the following year, it opened a headquarters in [[Fujinomiya City|Fujinomiya]]. Around this time, the mental health of Matsumoto (now going by the name Shoko Asahara) deteriorated \u2013 he developed a [[Hypochondriasis|health anxiety]] and expressed suicidal views.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite book|title=A Clock That Has Stopped|last=Matsumoto|first=Rika|year=2015|publisher=\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn August 1989, the group was granted official religious corporation status by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]], giving it privileges such as tax breaks and freedom from governmental oversight.

Despite showing confidence in their ability to gain seats in the diet, the party received only 1,783 votes; the failure to achieve power legitimately, blamed by Asahara on an external conspiracy propagated by ''\"[[Freemasons]] and [[Jews]]\"'', caused him to order the cult to produce [[botulinum]] and [[phosgene]] in order to overthrow the Japanese government. As members became disillusioned with the group (following contact with the outside world made during the election campaign) and defected, an attitude among the remaining members that 'the unenlightened' did not deserve salvation became accepted.<ref name=murakami>{{cite book|title=Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche|last=Murakami|first=Haruki|year=1997|publisher=Kodansha|isbn=0-375-72580-6|url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundtokyo00haru}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to stockpile botulinum toxin proved unsuccessful. Seiichi Endo - one of the members tasked with acquiring botulinum toxin - collected soil samples from the [[Ishikari River]], and attempted to produce the toxin using three 10,000 litre capacity fermenters.

The spraying attacks failed to cause any ill effects among the population but 1270 people attended the seminar, many of them becoming devout monks.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the intention of building a compound incorporating facilities such as a phosgene plant (as well as facilities to manufacture [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[chlorine]] gas), Aum Shinrikyo used 14 dummy companies to purchase acres of land in Namino (now part of [[Aso, Kumamoto|Aso city]]), and began construction. However, public attitudes towards the cult had become very negative due to suspicions around the cult's illegal activities. These attitudes were exacerbated once it was revealed to the surrounding community that the group had acted illegally. A police investigation in October resulted in the arrests of several Aum members, causing Asahara to fear a police raid \u2013 he hence ordered the destruction of all biological and chemical weapon stockpiles, and for the cult to focus on legitimate, non-violent strategies only.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Restarting violent activity====\nAfter the destruction of the illegal weapon stockpiles, the cult relied on 'mainstream' methods to attract other members \u2013 this included frequent television appearances by Asahara, as well as the setting up of the 'Aum Shinrikyo broadcasting' radio station in Russia in April 1992. However, starting in late 1992, Asahara's mental health deteriorated further \u2013 his suicidal feelings intensified, he began to complain of hallucinations and paranoia,<ref name=clock/> and he withdrew from public appearances (except for on Aum Shinrikyo Broadcasting), claiming society was preventing him from fulfilling his destiny as Christ. The concurrent replacement of the previously predominantly female group of top advisers with a more aggressive male group lead to the gradual restarting of the violent campaign to seize power.

In September 1992, Asahara was made president of the ironworks, resulting in 90% of staff being dismissed or leaving due to the 'Aum-ification' of the plant. These workers were replaced with other members of the group. Over the course of 1993, the cult smuggled [[AK-74]] rifles and 5.45mm bullets, and began to prototype rifles based on the AK-74 design.\n[[File:Layout_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_biological_weapons_facility.png|left|thumb|Layout of the Aum Shinrikyo biological weapons facility.]]\nUnder the oversight of Endo, the biological weapons division of the cult resumed \u2013 this time pursuing not only botulinum toxin, but also [[anthrax]], using improved 200-litre drum fermenters at their Kameido facility.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAgain, the group did not attempt to purify the resulting product, which resembled a foul-smelling brown slurry. Further failed attacks on individuals were attempted in 1993 and 1994 using botulinum \u2013 first using a homemade sprayer mounted to a car, and then by mixing with juice \u2013 but neither had any effects. Five days before the sarin attack on the Tokyo subways, botulinum was dispersed in a failed attack on [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki station]] \u2013 a dissident member had replaced the active compound with water, but the cult had failed to acquire an active strain of ''C. botulinum''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, the Aum anthrax program was a failure \u2013 despite having access to a sympathiser outside of the group who could acquire anthrax spores, the strain received by the group was a Sterne vaccine strain incapable of causing harm. It was unclear why, despite having this knowledge, the group executed two attacks in 1993 using this vaccine strain \u2013 once from the roof of the headquarters building in Kameido, and once from a truck with a custom spraying device, aimed at the Diet building, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Tower. Both attacks caused no effects other than a foul smell, reported by passers-by.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Endo attempted a different strategy \u2013 by desiccating the slurry, the ''B. anthracis'' spores could be spread as a powder, rather than through spraying \u2013 this was achieved with a crude hot air dryer. Nakagawa has claimed that an attempt was made to spread this powder through the centre of Tokyo, but this, also, had no effects. The total failure of the biological weapons program had, by mid-1993, convinced Asahara to focus on the chemical weapons division under Masami Tsuchiya. While Endo would be promoted within the cult to 'health minister' in 1994 \u2013 reflecting his seniority \u2013 no further attacks using biological weapons were attempted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Chemical weapon production===\nTsuchiya had established a small laboratory in their [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] complex in November 1992. After initial research (done at [[Tsukuba University]], where he had previously studied chemistry), he suggested to Hideo Murai \u2013 a senior Aum advisor who had tasked him with researching chemical weapons in November 1992, out of fear that the cult would soon be attacked with them \u2013 that the most cost-effective substance to synthesise would be sarin.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered to produce a small amount \u2013 within a month, the necessary equipment had been ordered and installed, and 10-20g of sarin had been produced via synthetic procedures derived from the five-step DHMP process as originally described by IG Farben in 1938, and as used by the Allies after World War II.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nAfter this small quantity had been produced, Murai ordered Tsuchiya to produce about 70  tons \u2013 when Tsuchiya protested, noting that this level of scaling was not feasible in a research laboratory, a chemical plant was ordered to be built alongside the biological production facility in the Fujigamine district of Kamikuishiki, to be labelled Satyan-7 ('Truth'). The specialised equipment and substantial chemicals needed to run the facility were purchased using [[shell companies]] under Hasegawa Chemical, a chemical company already owned by Aum. At the same time, in September 1993, Asahara and 24 other cult members travelled from Tokyo to [[Perth]], Australia, bringing generators, tools, protective equipment (including gas masks and respirators), and chemicals to make sarin.\n\nAfter repurchasing chemicals confiscated by customs, the group chartered aircraft from Perth to [[Banjawarn Station]], where they searched for uranium deposits to make [[Nuclear terrorism|nuclear weapons]], and may have tested the efficacy of the synthesised sarin on animals. They remained in Australia for eight days and attempted to return in October of the same year, but were denied visas \u2013 Banjawarn Station would be sold a year later.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Overhead_view_of_Satyan_7.png|thumb|Overhead view of the Satyan-7 chemical weapon facility.]]\nThe Satyan-7 facility was declared ready for occupancy by September 1993 with the capacity to produce about 40\u201350 litres of sarin, being equipped with 30L capacity mixing flasks within protective hoods, and eventually employing 100 Aum members; the UN would later estimate the value of the building and its contents at $30 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia|last1=Kaplan|first1=David|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrew|year=1996|publisher=Crown Publishing|isbn=978-0517705438}}</ref>\n\nDespite the safety features and often state-of-the-art equipment and practices, the operation of the facility was very unsafe - one analyst would later describe the cult as having 'a high degree of book learning, but virtually nothing in the way of technical skill'.<ref name=olson>{{cite journal|last1=Olson |first1=Kyle|date=1996|title=Overview: Recent events and responder implications|url=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar on Responding to the Consequences of Chemical and Biological Terrorism|volume=2|issue=36|pages=2\u201393}}</ref>\n\nWhen the facility developed leaks, buckets were used to contain spills; several technicians inhaled fumes on repeated occasions, developing 'symptoms ranging from nosebleeds to convulsions',<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/> and toxic chemicals leaked from the site and into the soil. Citizens lodged complaints about foul smells several times, with the cult claiming that the [[US Army]] had assaulted the complex with poison gas. An accident at the plant in November 1994 would eventually force the suspension of the production of chemical agents.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBy December, Tsuchiya had accumulated in total about 3&nbsp;kg of sarin \u2013 from this, two separate assassination attempts were made on [[Daisaku Ikeda]], leader of [[Soka Gakkai]] (a rival Japanese religious movement), in mid-1994. The first attack involved a truck with a spraying system, as previously used \u2013 the spraying system malfunctioned, spraying sarin into the truck itself, and mildly poisoning the operators. The second attack utilised a truck modified to include an evaporation system based on heating sarin over a gas stove fire; despite prior warnings from cult member Kazuyoshi Takizawa, the truck caught fire during the dissemination, severely poisoning the driver Tomomitsu Niimi and causing both Niimi and Murai \u2013 the operators \u2013 to flee. Niimi received an injection of [[atropine]] and pralidoximine iodine, saving his life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDespite the failure of the attack, the members of Aum were convinced of sarin's efficacy, prompting Asahara to appoint Takizawa in charge of operations of Satyan-7; Tsuchiya was assigned to several other projects and would go on to manufacture several [[psychoactives]] \u2013 [[LSD]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[methamphetamine]], [[mescaline]], and [[phenobarbital]] to be used in the cult activities and [[brainwashing]]; he would also manufacture small amounts of phosgene, VX, [[soman]], [[cyclosarin]], and gunpowder.

About a week later, on 27 June, 30L of sarin was loaded onto a truck equipped with a fan, heater, and pump \u2013 six members, pre-administered with sarin antidotes and wearing improvised gas masks, began the propagation of sarin at around 10:40pm, spraying for around 10\u201320 minutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDue to it being a warm evening, many residents had left their windows open while they slept \u2013 the first emergency call was made at 11:09pm. Within an hour, a mass disaster caused by an unknown toxic gas had been declared. Fifty-eight people were hospitalised, of whom eight people died, and an additional 253 people sought medical care at outpatient clinics.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Description_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_sarin_truck.png|thumb|Depiction of Aum Shinrikyo sarin truck.]]\nInvestigations after the Matsumoto attack were generally inconclusive, with the primary suspect being [[Yoshiyuki K\u014dno (victim)|Yoshiyuki K\u014dno]], whose wife had been left comatose by the attack. Blame would not be clearly attributed to Aum Shinrikyo until after the subway attack, despite tipoffs \u2013 in September 1994, two anonymous letters were sent to major media outlets in Japan \u2013 the first asserting that the group were responsible for the attack, and the second claiming that Matsumoto was an open-air 'experiment of sorts', noting that the results would have been much worse if sarin had been released indoors, such as in 'a crowded subway'.<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/>\n\nFollowing an accident at Satyan-7 the next month (and complaints from the surrounding communities), a police investigation revealed [[methylphosphonic acid]] and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid \u2013 the former being a degradation product of sarin, and the latter being a definitive signature of both sarin production and of failures in production. However, there was no law at the time prohibiting the production of the nerve agents. This evidence was left unacted on, but was leaked to the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] in January 1995, alerting Asahara and the cult, and causing Nakagawa and Endo to begin the process of destroying and/or hiding all nerve agents and biological weapons, which lasted until the end of February.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Preparation for the attack===\nFingerprint evidence for an Aum member linked to an earlier kidnapping, in addition to the sarin-contaminated soil samples, caused the police to set a raid date for 22 March. Asahara was made aware of the impending raid by two cult members inside the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], and ordered an attack on Tokyo subway lines close to the Metropolitan Police Department on the morning of the 20th March \u2013 possibly as a desperate attack to initiate the apocalypse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holy Terror: Armageddon in Tokyo|last=Brackett|first=D.

Later forensic analysis found that the sarin utilised in the attack was roughly half as pure as that used in the Matsumoto attack.\n\n==Attack==\nOn Monday, 20 March 1995, five members of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] launched a chemical attack on the [[Tokyo subway]] (on lines that are part of the present-day [[Tokyo Metro]]), one of the world's busiest commuter transport systems, at the peak of the morning [[rush hour]]. The chemical agent used, liquid [[sarin]], was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Each perpetrator carried two packets totaling approximately {{convert|0.9|liter|floz}} of sarin, except Yasuo Hayashi, who carried three bags totalling approximately {{convert|1.3|liter|floz}} of sarin. Aum originally planned to spread the sarin as an aerosol but did not follow through with it.  Sarin has an [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of {{val|550|u=\u00b5g|up=kg}}, corresponding to {{val|38.5|u=mg}} for a {{val|70|u=kg}} ({{val|154|u=lb}}) human; however, dispersal issues dramatically reduce its effectiveness.\n\nCarrying their packets of sarin and umbrellas with sharpened tips, the perpetrators boarded their appointed trains. At prearranged stations, the sarin packets were dropped and punctured several times with the sharpened tip of the umbrella.

The pair left Aum headquarters in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] at 6:00&nbsp;am and drove to [[Yotsuya Station]]. There Hirose boarded a westbound Marunouchi Line train, then changed to a northbound [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] [[Saiky\u014d Line]] train at [[Shinjuku Station]] and got off at [[Ikebukuro Station]]. He then bought a sports tabloid to wrap the sarin packets in and boarded the second car of Marunouchi Line train A777.\n\nAs he was about to release the sarin, Hirose believed the loud noises caused by the newspaper-wrapped packets had caught the attention of a [[student|schoolgirl]]. To avoid further suspicion, he got off the train at either [[Myogadani Station|Myogadani]] or [[Korakuen Station]] and moved to the third car instead of the second.\n\nAs the train approached [[Ochanomizu Station]], Hirose dropped the newspapers to the floor, repeated an Aum mantra and punctured both sarin packets with so much force that he bent the tip of his sharpened umbrella. Both packets were successfully broken, and all {{convert|900|ml|floz}} of sarin was released onto the floor of the train. Hirose then departed the train at Ochanomizu and left via Kitamura's car waiting outside the station. Hirose's clumsy release of the sarin resulted in him accidentally poisoning himself, but he was able to administer an antidote stored in Kitamura's car.\n\nAt [[Nakano-sakaue Station]], 14 stops later, two severely injured passengers were carried out of the train car, while station attendant Sumio Nishimura removed the sarin packets (one of these two passengers was the only fatality from this attack).

Five stops later, at 8:38&nbsp;am, the train reached [[Ogikubo Station]], the end of the [[Marunouchi Line]], all while passengers continued to board the train.

The entire ordeal resulted in one passenger's death with 358 being seriously injured.\n\n====Ikebukuro-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ike map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|right|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nMasato Yokoyama and his driver Kiyotaka Tonozaki were assigned to release sarin on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound Marunouchi Line. On the way to [[Shinjuku Station]], Tonozaki stopped to allow Yokoyama to buy a copy of ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'', to wrap the two sarin packets. When they arrived at the station, Yokoyama put on a wig and fake glasses and boarded the fifth car of the Ikebukuro-bound 07:39 Marunouchi Line train number B801. As the train approached [[Yotsuya Station]], Yokoyama began poking at the sarin packets. When the train reached the next station, he fled the scene with Tonozaki, leaving the sarin packets on the train car. The packets were not fully punctured. During his drop, Yokoyama left one packet fully intact, while the other packet was only punctured once (and with a small hole), resulting in the sarin being released relatively slowly.\n\nThe train reached the end of the line, Ikebukuro, at 8:30&nbsp;am where it would head back in the opposite direction. Before it departed the train was evacuated and searched, but the searchers failed to discover the sarin packets. The train departed Ikebukuro Station at 8:32&nbsp;am as the Shinjuku-bound A801. Passengers soon became ill and alerted station attendants of the sarin-soaked newspapers at [[K\u014drakuen Station]]. One station later, at [[Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme Station|Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme]], staff removed the sarin packets and mopped the floor, but the train continued on to Shinjuku. After arriving at 9:09&nbsp;am, the train once again began to make its way back to Ikebukuro as the B901. The train was finally put out of service at [[Kokkai-gijid\u014d-mae Station]] in Chiyoda at 9:27&nbsp;am, one hour and forty minutes after Yokoyama punctured the sarin packet. The attack resulted in no fatalities, but over 200 people were left in serious condition.\n\n===Hibiya Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine ne bound sarin attack.png|thumb|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den Station|T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nToru Toyoda and his driver Katsuya Takahashi were assigned to release sarin on the northeast-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]].\n\nThe pair, with Takahashi driving, left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 6:30&nbsp;am. After purchasing a copy of ''[[Hochi Shimbun]]'' and wrapping his two sarin packets, Toyoda arrived at [[Naka-Meguro Station]] where he boarded the first car of northeast-bound 07:59 Hibiya Line train number B711T. Sitting close to the door, he set the sarin packets on the floor. When the train arrived at the next station, [[Ebisu Station (Tokyo)|Ebisu]], Toyoda punctured both packets and got off the train. He was on the train for a total of two minutes, by far the quickest sarin drop out of the five attacks that day.\n\nTwo stops later, at [[Roppongi Station]], passengers in the train's first car began to feel the effects of the sarin and began to open the windows. By [[Kamiyacho Station]], the next stop, the passengers in the car had begun panicking. The first car was evacuated and several passengers were immediately taken to a hospital. Still, with the first car empty, the train continued down the line for one more stop until it was completely evacuated at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. This attack killed one person and seriously injured 532 others.\n\n====Naka-Meguro-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine se bound sarin attack.png|thumb|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Naka-Meguro Station|Naka-Meguro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nYasuo Hayashi and Shigeo Sugimoto were the team assigned to drop sarin on the southwest-bound Hibiya Line departing [[Kita-Senju Station]] for [[Naka-Meguro Station]]. Unlike the rest of the attackers, Hayashi carried three sarin packets onto the train instead of two. Prior to the attack, Hayashi asked to carry a flawed leftover packet in addition to the two others in an apparent bid to allay suspicions and prove his loyalty to the group.\n\nAfter Sugimoto escorted him to [[Ueno Station]], Hayashi boarded the third car of southwest-bound 07:43 Hibiya Line train number A720S and dropped his sarin packets to the floor. Two stops later, at [[Akihabara Station]], he punctured two of the three packets, left the train, and arrived back at Aum headquarters with Sugimoto by 8:30&nbsp;am. Hayashi made the most punctures of any of the perpetrators. By the next stop, passengers in the third car began to feel the effects of the sarin. Noticing the large, liquid-soaked package on the floor and assuming it was the culprit, one passenger kicked the sarin packets out of the train and onto [[Kodenmach\u014d Station]]'s subway platform. Four people in the station died as a result.\n\nA puddle of sarin remained on the floor of the passenger car as the train continued to the next station. At 8:10&nbsp;am, after the train pulled out of [[Hatch\u014dbori Station (Tokyo)|Hatch\u014dbori Station]], a passenger in the third car pressed the emergency stop button. The train was in a tunnel at the time, and was forced to proceed to [[Tsukiji Station]], where passengers stumbled out and collapsed on the station's platform and the train was taken out of service.\n\nThe attack was originally believed to be an explosion and was thus labeled as such in media reports. Eventually, station attendants realized that the attack was not an explosion, but rather a chemical attack. At 8:35&nbsp;am, the Hibiya Line was completely shut down and all commuters were evacuated. Between the five stations affected in this attack, 8 people died and 275 were seriously injured.\n\n==Main perpetrators==\nTen men were responsible for carrying out the attacks: five released the sarin, while the other five served as [[Crime scene getaway|getaway drivers]].\n\nThe teams were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The attack was directed against trains passing through [[Kasumigaseki]] and [[Nagatach\u014d, Tokyo|Nagatach\u014d]], where the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] (Japanese parliament) is headquartered in Tokyo.\n\nThe group, led by [[Shoko Asahara]], had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, including the [[Matsumoto sarin attack]] nine months earlier. They had also produced several other nerve agents, including [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], and attempted to produce [[botulinum toxin]] and had perpetrated several failed acts of [[bioterrorism]]. Asahara had been made aware of a police raid scheduled for March 22 and had planned the Tokyo subway attack in order to hinder police investigations into the cult and perhaps spark the [[apocalypse]] they believed in.  The Leader Also wanted to start a Third World War.\n\nIn the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. Police activity continued throughout the summer, and over 200 members were arrested, including Asahara. Thirteen of the senior Aum management were sentenced to death and later executed; many others were given prison sentences up to life.

The group believed in a doctrine revolving around a syncretic mixture of Indian and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], as well as Christian and Hindu beliefs,<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43395483</ref> especially relating to the Hindu god [[Shiva]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/may/16/japan.fromthearchive</ref> They believed [[Armageddon]] to be inevitable in the form of a global war involving the United States and Japan; that non-members were doomed to eternal hell, but could be saved if killed by cult members; and that only members of the cult would survive the apocalypse, and would afterwards build the Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. In 1987, the group rebranded and established a [[New York City|New York]] branch; the following year, it opened a headquarters in [[Fujinomiya City|Fujinomiya]]. Around this time, the mental health of Matsumoto (now going by the name Shoko Asahara) deteriorated \u2013 he developed a [[Hypochondriasis|health anxiety]] and expressed suicidal views.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite book|title=A Clock That Has Stopped|last=Matsumoto|first=Rika|year=2015|publisher=\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn August 1989, the group was granted official religious corporation status by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]], giving it privileges such as tax breaks and freedom from governmental oversight. This recognition caused dramatic growth, including an increase in net worth from less than 430 million yen to over 100 billion yen (approximately $5.6m to $1.1b in 2017 dollars) over the next six years, as well as an increase in membership from around 20 members to around 20,000 by 1992.<ref name=\"subcommittee\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part03.htm|title=A Case Study on Aum Shinrikyo|date=31 October 1995|publisher= Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations}}</ref>\n\nThe drastically increasing popularity of the group also saw an increase in violent behaviour from its members. In the year preceding its recognition by the Tokyo government, a member of the cult \u2013 Terayuki Majima \u2013 had accidentally drowned during a ritual; his body was cremated, with the remaining bones ground up and scattered over a nearby lake. Majima's friend \u2013 a fellow member of the group \u2013 was murdered by members acting under Asahara's orders, after becoming disillusioned and trying to leave.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asahara rearrested in 1989 cultist murder|work=The Daily Shimbun|publisher=The Japan News|page=2|date=21 October 1995}}</ref>\n\nThree months after recognition, six Aum Shinrikyo members were involved in [[Sakamoto family murder|the murder]] of a lawyer, Tsutsumi Sakamoto, who had been working on a class-action lawsuit against the cult, as well as his wife and 1-year-old son.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1707955.stm|title=Death sentence on Aum leader upheld|date=13 December 2001|publisher=BBC.com}}</ref> Asahara had previously advanced the concept of ''<nowiki/>'poa''': a doctrine which stated that not only were people with bad [[karma]] doomed to an eternity in [[hell]] (unless they were 'rebirthed' through intervention by 'enlightened people'), but that it was acceptable to kill those at risk of bad karma to save them from hell.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Early attempts to seize power====\nAsahara had experienced [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] as early as 1985 \u2013 while meditating, he claims that the god Shiva had been revealed to him, and had appointed him 'Abiraketsu no Mikoto' ('The god of light who leads the armies of the gods'), who was to build the [[Shambhala|Kingdom of Shambhala]], a [[Utopia|utopian society]] made up of those who had developed 'psychic powers'.<ref name=shimazono>{{cite journal|last1=Susumu|first1=Shimazono|date=1995|title=In the Wake of Aum: The Formation and Transformation of a Universe of Belief|url=http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag52022.pdf|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|volume=22|issue=3/4|pages=381\u2013415|doi=10.18874/jjrs.22.3-4.1995.381-415}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Asahara announced that the group would run 25 candidates in the [[1990 Japanese general election|election that year]] to the [[Japanese Diet]], under the banner of {{nihongo|''Shinrito''|\u771f\u7406\u515a|\"Truth Party\"}}. Despite showing confidence in their ability to gain seats in the diet, the party received only 1,783 votes; the failure to achieve power legitimately, blamed by Asahara on an external conspiracy propagated by ''\"[[Freemasons]] and [[Jews]]\"'', caused him to order the cult to produce [[botulinum]] and [[phosgene]] in order to overthrow the Japanese government. As members became disillusioned with the group (following contact with the outside world made during the election campaign) and defected, an attitude among the remaining members that 'the unenlightened' did not deserve salvation became accepted.<ref name=murakami>{{cite book|title=Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche|last=Murakami|first=Haruki|year=1997|publisher=Kodansha|isbn=0-375-72580-6|url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundtokyo00haru}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to stockpile botulinum toxin proved unsuccessful. Seiichi Endo - one of the members tasked with acquiring botulinum toxin - collected soil samples from the [[Ishikari River]], and attempted to produce the toxin using three 10,000 litre capacity fermenters. In total, around 50 batches of 9,000 litres of a crude broth were produced \u2013 however, the cult did not attempt to purify the broth (which mostly would have consisted of [[growth medium|bacterial cultivation media]]; one member even fell into one of the fermenters and nearly drowned, but otherwise suffered no ill effects.<ref name=cnas>{{cite web|url=http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|title=Aum Shinrikyo: Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons|date=July 2011|publisher=Centre for a New American Security}}</ref>\n\nDespite mouse bioassays run by Tomomasu Nakagawa (another cult member assisting Endo) returning no toxic effects, in April 1990 the crude broth was loaded into three trucks equipped with custom spray devices, which was to be sprayed at two US naval bases, Narita airport, the Diet building, the Imperial Palace, and the headquarters of a rival religious group.<ref name=chronology>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/aum_chrn.pdf|title=Chronology of Aum Shinrikyo's CBQ Activities|date=June 2016|publisher=Monterey Institute of International Studies}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, Asahara announced that the coming apocalyptic war could not save people outside of the cult, and that members should attend a three-day seminar in [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigakijima]] in order to seek shelter. The spraying attacks failed to cause any ill effects among the population but 1270 people attended the seminar, many of them becoming devout monks.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the intention of building a compound incorporating facilities such as a phosgene plant (as well as facilities to manufacture [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[chlorine]] gas), Aum Shinrikyo used 14 dummy companies to purchase acres of land in Namino (now part of [[Aso, Kumamoto|Aso city]]), and began construction. However, public attitudes towards the cult had become very negative due to suspicions around the cult's illegal activities. These attitudes were exacerbated once it was revealed to the surrounding community that the group had acted illegally. A police investigation in October resulted in the arrests of several Aum members, causing Asahara to fear a police raid \u2013 he hence ordered the destruction of all biological and chemical weapon stockpiles, and for the cult to focus on legitimate, non-violent strategies only.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Restarting violent activity====\nAfter the destruction of the illegal weapon stockpiles, the cult relied on 'mainstream' methods to attract other members \u2013 this included frequent television appearances by Asahara, as well as the setting up of the 'Aum Shinrikyo broadcasting' radio station in Russia in April 1992. However, starting in late 1992, Asahara's mental health deteriorated further \u2013 his suicidal feelings intensified, he began to complain of hallucinations and paranoia,<ref name=clock/> and he withdrew from public appearances (except for on Aum Shinrikyo Broadcasting), claiming society was preventing him from fulfilling his destiny as Christ. The concurrent replacement of the previously predominantly female group of top advisers with a more aggressive male group lead to the gradual restarting of the violent campaign to seize power.

In September 1992, Asahara was made president of the ironworks, resulting in 90% of staff being dismissed or leaving due to the 'Aum-ification' of the plant. These workers were replaced with other members of the group. Over the course of 1993, the cult smuggled [[AK-74]] rifles and 5.45mm bullets, and began to prototype rifles based on the AK-74 design.\n[[File:Layout_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_biological_weapons_facility.png|left|thumb|Layout of the Aum Shinrikyo biological weapons facility.]]\nUnder the oversight of Endo, the biological weapons division of the cult resumed \u2013 this time pursuing not only botulinum toxin, but also [[anthrax]], using improved 200-litre drum fermenters at their Kameido facility.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAgain, the group did not attempt to purify the resulting product, which resembled a foul-smelling brown slurry. Further failed attacks on individuals were attempted in 1993 and 1994 using botulinum \u2013 first using a homemade sprayer mounted to a car, and then by mixing with juice \u2013 but neither had any effects. Five days before the sarin attack on the Tokyo subways, botulinum was dispersed in a failed attack on [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki station]] \u2013 a dissident member had replaced the active compound with water, but the cult had failed to acquire an active strain of ''C. botulinum''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, the Aum anthrax program was a failure \u2013 despite having access to a sympathiser outside of the group who could acquire anthrax spores, the strain received by the group was a Sterne vaccine strain incapable of causing harm. It was unclear why, despite having this knowledge, the group executed two attacks in 1993 using this vaccine strain \u2013 once from the roof of the headquarters building in Kameido, and once from a truck with a custom spraying device, aimed at the Diet building, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Tower. Both attacks caused no effects other than a foul smell, reported by passers-by.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Endo attempted a different strategy \u2013 by desiccating the slurry, the ''B. anthracis'' spores could be spread as a powder, rather than through spraying \u2013 this was achieved with a crude hot air dryer. Nakagawa has claimed that an attempt was made to spread this powder through the centre of Tokyo, but this, also, had no effects. The total failure of the biological weapons program had, by mid-1993, convinced Asahara to focus on the chemical weapons division under Masami Tsuchiya. While Endo would be promoted within the cult to 'health minister' in 1994 \u2013 reflecting his seniority \u2013 no further attacks using biological weapons were attempted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Chemical weapon production===\nTsuchiya had established a small laboratory in their [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] complex in November 1992. After initial research (done at [[Tsukuba University]], where he had previously studied chemistry), he suggested to Hideo Murai \u2013 a senior Aum advisor who had tasked him with researching chemical weapons in November 1992, out of fear that the cult would soon be attacked with them \u2013 that the most cost-effective substance to synthesise would be sarin.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered to produce a small amount \u2013 within a month, the necessary equipment had been ordered and installed, and 10-20g of sarin had been produced via synthetic procedures derived from the five-step DHMP process as originally described by IG Farben in 1938, and as used by the Allies after World War II.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nAfter this small quantity had been produced, Murai ordered Tsuchiya to produce about 70  tons \u2013 when Tsuchiya protested, noting that this level of scaling was not feasible in a research laboratory, a chemical plant was ordered to be built alongside the biological production facility in the Fujigamine district of Kamikuishiki, to be labelled Satyan-7 ('Truth'). The specialised equipment and substantial chemicals needed to run the facility were purchased using [[shell companies]] under Hasegawa Chemical, a chemical company already owned by Aum. At the same time, in September 1993, Asahara and 24 other cult members travelled from Tokyo to [[Perth]], Australia, bringing generators, tools, protective equipment (including gas masks and respirators), and chemicals to make sarin.\n\nAfter repurchasing chemicals confiscated by customs, the group chartered aircraft from Perth to [[Banjawarn Station]], where they searched for uranium deposits to make [[Nuclear terrorism|nuclear weapons]], and may have tested the efficacy of the synthesised sarin on animals. They remained in Australia for eight days and attempted to return in October of the same year, but were denied visas \u2013 Banjawarn Station would be sold a year later.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Overhead_view_of_Satyan_7.png|thumb|Overhead view of the Satyan-7 chemical weapon facility.]]\nThe Satyan-7 facility was declared ready for occupancy by September 1993 with the capacity to produce about 40\u201350 litres of sarin, being equipped with 30L capacity mixing flasks within protective hoods, and eventually employing 100 Aum members; the UN would later estimate the value of the building and its contents at $30 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia|last1=Kaplan|first1=David|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrew|year=1996|publisher=Crown Publishing|isbn=978-0517705438}}</ref>\n\nDespite the safety features and often state-of-the-art equipment and practices, the operation of the facility was very unsafe - one analyst would later describe the cult as having 'a high degree of book learning, but virtually nothing in the way of technical skill'.<ref name=olson>{{cite journal|last1=Olson |first1=Kyle|date=1996|title=Overview: Recent events and responder implications|url=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar on Responding to the Consequences of Chemical and Biological Terrorism|volume=2|issue=36|pages=2\u201393}}</ref>\n\nWhen the facility developed leaks, buckets were used to contain spills; several technicians inhaled fumes on repeated occasions, developing 'symptoms ranging from nosebleeds to convulsions',<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/> and toxic chemicals leaked from the site and into the soil. Citizens lodged complaints about foul smells several times, with the cult claiming that the [[US Army]] had assaulted the complex with poison gas. An accident at the plant in November 1994 would eventually force the suspension of the production of chemical agents.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBy December, Tsuchiya had accumulated in total about 3&nbsp;kg of sarin \u2013 from this, two separate assassination attempts were made on [[Daisaku Ikeda]], leader of [[Soka Gakkai]] (a rival Japanese religious movement), in mid-1994. The first attack involved a truck with a spraying system, as previously used \u2013 the spraying system malfunctioned, spraying sarin into the truck itself, and mildly poisoning the operators. The second attack utilised a truck modified to include an evaporation system based on heating sarin over a gas stove fire; despite prior warnings from cult member Kazuyoshi Takizawa, the truck caught fire during the dissemination, severely poisoning the driver Tomomitsu Niimi and causing both Niimi and Murai \u2013 the operators \u2013 to flee. Niimi received an injection of [[atropine]] and pralidoximine iodine, saving his life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDespite the failure of the attack, the members of Aum were convinced of sarin's efficacy, prompting Asahara to appoint Takizawa in charge of operations of Satyan-7; Tsuchiya was assigned to several other projects and would go on to manufacture several [[psychoactives]] \u2013 [[LSD]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[methamphetamine]], [[mescaline]], and [[phenobarbital]] to be used in the cult activities and [[brainwashing]]; he would also manufacture small amounts of phosgene, VX, [[soman]], [[cyclosarin]], and gunpowder.

About a week later, on 27 June, 30L of sarin was loaded onto a truck equipped with a fan, heater, and pump \u2013 six members, pre-administered with sarin antidotes and wearing improvised gas masks, began the propagation of sarin at around 10:40pm, spraying for around 10\u201320 minutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDue to it being a warm evening, many residents had left their windows open while they slept \u2013 the first emergency call was made at 11:09pm. Within an hour, a mass disaster caused by an unknown toxic gas had been declared. Fifty-eight people were hospitalised, of whom eight people died, and an additional 253 people sought medical care at outpatient clinics.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Description_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_sarin_truck.png|thumb|Depiction of Aum Shinrikyo sarin truck.]]\nInvestigations after the Matsumoto attack were generally inconclusive, with the primary suspect being [[Yoshiyuki K\u014dno (victim)|Yoshiyuki K\u014dno]], whose wife had been left comatose by the attack. Blame would not be clearly attributed to Aum Shinrikyo until after the subway attack, despite tipoffs \u2013 in September 1994, two anonymous letters were sent to major media outlets in Japan \u2013 the first asserting that the group were responsible for the attack, and the second claiming that Matsumoto was an open-air 'experiment of sorts', noting that the results would have been much worse if sarin had been released indoors, such as in 'a crowded subway'.<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/>\n\nFollowing an accident at Satyan-7 the next month (and complaints from the surrounding communities), a police investigation revealed [[methylphosphonic acid]] and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid \u2013 the former being a degradation product of sarin, and the latter being a definitive signature of both sarin production and of failures in production. However, there was no law at the time prohibiting the production of the nerve agents. This evidence was left unacted on, but was leaked to the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] in January 1995, alerting Asahara and the cult, and causing Nakagawa and Endo to begin the process of destroying and/or hiding all nerve agents and biological weapons, which lasted until the end of February.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Preparation for the attack===\nFingerprint evidence for an Aum member linked to an earlier kidnapping, in addition to the sarin-contaminated soil samples, caused the police to set a raid date for 22 March. Asahara was made aware of the impending raid by two cult members inside the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], and ordered an attack on Tokyo subway lines close to the Metropolitan Police Department on the morning of the 20th March \u2013 possibly as a desperate attack to initiate the apocalypse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holy Terror: Armageddon in Tokyo|last=Brackett|first=D.

Later forensic analysis found that the sarin utilised in the attack was roughly half as pure as that used in the Matsumoto attack.\n\n==Attack==\nOn Monday, 20 March 1995, five members of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] launched a chemical attack on the [[Tokyo subway]] (on lines that are part of the present-day [[Tokyo Metro]]), one of the world's busiest commuter transport systems, at the peak of the morning [[rush hour]]. The chemical agent used, liquid [[sarin]], was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Each perpetrator carried two packets totaling approximately {{convert|0.9|liter|floz}} of sarin, except Yasuo Hayashi, who carried three bags totalling approximately {{convert|1.3|liter|floz}} of sarin. Aum originally planned to spread the sarin as an aerosol but did not follow through with it.  Sarin has an [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of {{val|550|u=\u00b5g|up=kg}}, corresponding to {{val|38.5|u=mg}} for a {{val|70|u=kg}} ({{val|154|u=lb}}) human; however, dispersal issues dramatically reduce its effectiveness.\n\nCarrying their packets of sarin and umbrellas with sharpened tips, the perpetrators boarded their appointed trains. At prearranged stations, the sarin packets were dropped and punctured several times with the sharpened tip of the umbrella. Each perpetrator then got off the train and exited the station to meet his accomplice with a car.<ref>https://www.wired.com/2009/03/march-20-1995-poison-gas-wreaks-tokyo-subway-terror-2/</ref> Leaving the punctured packets on the floor allowed the sarin to leak out into the train car and stations. This sarin affected passengers, subway workers, and those who came into contact with them.

Hayashi was the perpetrator and Niimi was his getaway driver. On the way to [[Sendagi Station]], Niimi purchased newspapers to wrap the sarin packets in\u2014the [[Japan Communist Party]]'s ''[[Akahata]]'' and the [[S\u014dka Gakkai International|S\u014dka Gakkai]]'s ''[[Seikyo Shimbun]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nHayashi eventually chose to use ''Akahata''. Wearing a [[surgical mask]] commonly worn by the Japanese during cold and flu season, Hayashi boarded the first car of southwest-bound 07:48 Chiyoda Line train number A725K. As the train approached [[Shin-Ochanomizu Station]], the central business district in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], he punctured one of his two bags of sarin, leaving the other untouched, and exited the train at Shin-Ochanomizu.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe train proceeded down the line with the punctured bag of sarin leaking until 4 stops later at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. There, the bags were removed and eventually disposed of by station attendants, of whom two died. The train continued on to the next station where it was completely stopped, evacuated and cleaned.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Marunouchi Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Ogikubo-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ogi map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ogikubo Station|Ogikubo]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nTwo men, Ken'ichi Hirose and Koichi Kitamura, were assigned to release two sarin packets on the westbound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] destined for [[Ogikubo Station]]. The pair left Aum headquarters in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] at 6:00&nbsp;am and drove to [[Yotsuya Station]]. There Hirose boarded a westbound Marunouchi Line train, then changed to a northbound [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] [[Saiky\u014d Line]] train at [[Shinjuku Station]] and got off at [[Ikebukuro Station]]. He then bought a sports tabloid to wrap the sarin packets in and boarded the second car of Marunouchi Line train A777.\n\nAs he was about to release the sarin, Hirose believed the loud noises caused by the newspaper-wrapped packets had caught the attention of a [[student|schoolgirl]]. To avoid further suspicion, he got off the train at either [[Myogadani Station|Myogadani]] or [[Korakuen Station]] and moved to the third car instead of the second.\n\nAs the train approached [[Ochanomizu Station]], Hirose dropped the newspapers to the floor, repeated an Aum mantra and punctured both sarin packets with so much force that he bent the tip of his sharpened umbrella. Both packets were successfully broken, and all {{convert|900|ml|floz}} of sarin was released onto the floor of the train. Hirose then departed the train at Ochanomizu and left via Kitamura's car waiting outside the station. Hirose's clumsy release of the sarin resulted in him accidentally poisoning himself, but he was able to administer an antidote stored in Kitamura's car.\n\nAt [[Nakano-sakaue Station]], 14 stops later, two severely injured passengers were carried out of the train car, while station attendant Sumio Nishimura removed the sarin packets (one of these two passengers was the only fatality from this attack). The train continued with sarin still on the floor of the third car. Five stops later, at 8:38&nbsp;am, the train reached [[Ogikubo Station]], the end of the [[Marunouchi Line]], all while passengers continued to board the train. The train continued eastbound until it was finally taken out of service at [[Shin-K\u014denji Station]] two stops later. The entire ordeal resulted in one passenger's death with 358 being seriously injured.\n\n====Ikebukuro-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ike map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|right|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nMasato Yokoyama and his driver Kiyotaka Tonozaki were assigned to release sarin on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound Marunouchi Line. On the way to [[Shinjuku Station]], Tonozaki stopped to allow Yokoyama to buy a copy of ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'', to wrap the two sarin packets. When they arrived at the station, Yokoyama put on a wig and fake glasses and boarded the fifth car of the Ikebukuro-bound 07:39 Marunouchi Line train number B801. As the train approached [[Yotsuya Station]], Yokoyama began poking at the sarin packets. When the train reached the next station, he fled the scene with Tonozaki, leaving the sarin packets on the train car. The packets were not fully punctured. During his drop, Yokoyama left one packet fully intact, while the other packet was only punctured once (and with a small hole), resulting in the sarin being released relatively slowly.\n\nThe train reached the end of the line, Ikebukuro, at 8:30&nbsp;am where it would head back in the opposite direction. Before it departed the train was evacuated and searched, but the searchers failed to discover the sarin packets. The train departed Ikebukuro Station at 8:32&nbsp;am as the Shinjuku-bound A801. Passengers soon became ill and alerted station attendants of the sarin-soaked newspapers at [[K\u014drakuen Station]]. One station later, at [[Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme Station|Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme]], staff removed the sarin packets and mopped the floor, but the train continued on to Shinjuku. After arriving at 9:09&nbsp;am, the train once again began to make its way back to Ikebukuro as the B901. The train was finally put out of service at [[Kokkai-gijid\u014d-mae Station]] in Chiyoda at 9:27&nbsp;am, one hour and forty minutes after Yokoyama punctured the sarin packet. The attack resulted in no fatalities, but over 200 people were left in serious condition.\n\n===Hibiya Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine ne bound sarin attack.png|thumb|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den Station|T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nToru Toyoda and his driver Katsuya Takahashi were assigned to release sarin on the northeast-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]].\n\nThe pair, with Takahashi driving, left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 6:30&nbsp;am. After purchasing a copy of ''[[Hochi Shimbun]]'' and wrapping his two sarin packets, Toyoda arrived at [[Naka-Meguro Station]] where he boarded the first car of northeast-bound 07:59 Hibiya Line train number B711T. Sitting close to the door, he set the sarin packets on the floor. When the train arrived at the next station, [[Ebisu Station (Tokyo)|Ebisu]], Toyoda punctured both packets and got off the train. He was on the train for a total of two minutes, by far the quickest sarin drop out of the five attacks that day.\n\nTwo stops later, at [[Roppongi Station]], passengers in the train's first car began to feel the effects of the sarin and began to open the windows. By [[Kamiyacho Station]], the next stop, the passengers in the car had begun panicking. The first car was evacuated and several passengers were immediately taken to a hospital. Still, with the first car empty, the train continued down the line for one more stop until it was completely evacuated at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. This attack killed one person and seriously injured 532 others.\n\n====Naka-Meguro-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine se bound sarin attack.png|thumb|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Naka-Meguro Station|Naka-Meguro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nYasuo Hayashi and Shigeo Sugimoto were the team assigned to drop sarin on the southwest-bound Hibiya Line departing [[Kita-Senju Station]] for [[Naka-Meguro Station]]. Unlike the rest of the attackers, Hayashi carried three sarin packets onto the train instead of two. Prior to the attack, Hayashi asked to carry a flawed leftover packet in addition to the two others in an apparent bid to allay suspicions and prove his loyalty to the group.\n\nAfter Sugimoto escorted him to [[Ueno Station]], Hayashi boarded the third car of southwest-bound 07:43 Hibiya Line train number A720S and dropped his sarin packets to the floor. Two stops later, at [[Akihabara Station]], he punctured two of the three packets, left the train, and arrived back at Aum headquarters with Sugimoto by 8:30&nbsp;am. Hayashi made the most punctures of any of the perpetrators. By the next stop, passengers in the third car began to feel the effects of the sarin. Noticing the large, liquid-soaked package on the floor and assuming it was the culprit, one passenger kicked the sarin packets out of the train and onto [[Kodenmach\u014d Station]]'s subway platform. Four people in the station died as a result.\n\nA puddle of sarin remained on the floor of the passenger car as the train continued to the next station. At 8:10&nbsp;am, after the train pulled out of [[Hatch\u014dbori Station (Tokyo)|Hatch\u014dbori Station]], a passenger in the third car pressed the emergency stop button. The train was in a tunnel at the time, and was forced to proceed to [[Tsukiji Station]], where passengers stumbled out and collapsed on the station's platform and the train was taken out of service.\n\nThe attack was originally believed to be an explosion and was thus labeled as such in media reports. Eventually, station attendants realized that the attack was not an explosion, but rather a chemical attack. At 8:35&nbsp;am, the Hibiya Line was completely shut down and all commuters were evacuated.

This proved to be a very fortunate coincidence as the hospital was able to take in most of the 600+ victims at Tsukiji Station, resulting in no fatalities at that station.\n\nAs there was a severe shortage of antidotes in Tokyo, sarin antidote stored in rural hospitals as an antidote for herbicide/insecticide poisoning was delivered to nearby [[Shinkansen]] stations, where it was collected by a Ministry of Health official on a train bound for Tokyo.\n\n===Defense offered by Japanese and American scholars===\nAum had carefully cultivated the friendship of Japanese scholars of religion. After the sarin gas attack, some of them, including Shimada Hiromi, a professor at Tokyo's [[Japan Women's University]], suggested Aum may be innocent.

The Tokyo High Court postponed its decision on the appeal until results were obtained from a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which was issued to determine whether Asahara was fit to stand trial. In February 2006, the court ruled that Asahara was indeed fit to stand trial, and on 27 March 2006, rejected the appeal against his death sentence. Japan's Supreme Court upheld this decision on 15 September 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara's execution was postponed due to the further arrests of the two remaining Aum Shinrikyo members wanted in connection with the attack.
