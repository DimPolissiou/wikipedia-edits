Critics contend, however, that the technology could lead to [[political repression]] as governments could use implants to track and persecute human rights activists, labor activists, civil dissidents, and political opponents; criminals and domestic abusers could use them to stalk and harass their victims; and child abusers could use them to locate and abduct children.\n\nAnother suggested application for a tracking implant, discussed in 2008 by the legislature of [[Indonesia]]'s [[Irian Jaya]] would be to monitor the activities of persons infected with [[HIV]], aimed at reducing their chances of infecting other people.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE4AN3U620081124 \"Indonesia's Papua plans to tag AIDS sufferers\"], Mon Nov 24, 2008.</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1862347,00.html \n|title=Papua Proposal: A Microchip to Track the HIV-Positive|author=Jason Tedjasukmana |date= Nov 26, 2008|periodical =Time }}\n</ref> The microchipping section was not, however, included into the final version of the provincial ''HIV/AIDS Handling bylaw'' passed by the legislature in December 2008.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/133495.php Government Of Indonesian Province Rejects Plan To Implant Microchips In Some HIV-Positive People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225060958/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/133495.php |date=2013-12-25 }}, 2008-12-08</ref> With current technology, this would not be workable anyway, since there is no implantable device on the market with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] capability.\n\nSince modern payment methods rely upon RFID/NFC, it is thought that implantable microchips, if they were to ever become popular in use, would form a part of the cashless society.<ref>[http://www.dontchipmebro.com/the-cashless-society/ \"Cashless Society\"] This is a dead link.</ref> Verichip implants have already been used in nightclubs such as the Baja club for such a purpose, allowing patrons to purchase drinks with their implantable microchip.\n\n==Criticisms and concerns==\n\n===Cancer risks===\nIn a self-published report<ref>http://www.antichips.com/cancer/<nowiki/>{{Dead link|date=December 2019}} Microchip-Induced Tumors in Laboratory Rodents and Dogs: A Review of the Literature 1990\u20132006</ref> anti-RFID advocate [[Katherine Albrecht]], who refers to RFID devices as \"[[spy chips]]\", cites [[veterinary]] and [[toxicology|toxicological]] studies carried out from 1996 to 2006 which found lab rodents injected with microchips as an incidental part of unrelated experiments and dogs implanted with identification microchips sometimes developed cancerous tumors at the injection site ([[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[sarcoma]]s) as evidence of a human implantation risk.<ref name=WashingPost>{{citation |last=Lewan |first=Todd |title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumours |date=September 8, 2007 |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> However, the link between foreign-body tumorigenesis in lab animals and implantation in humans has been publicly refuted as erroneous and misleading<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?3609|title=VeriChip Defends the Safety of Implanted RFID Tags|author=RFID Journal|date=|work=rfidjournal.com|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> and the report's author has been criticized over the use of \"provocative\" language \"not based in scientific fact\".<ref>{{Citation|last=uownow|title=IEEE ISTAS 2010 @ UOW - Dr Katherine Albrecht|date=2011-03-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS13kFWQIYM#t=60m53s|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> Notably, none of the studies cited specifically set out to investigate the cancer risk of implanted microchips and so none of the studies had a control group of animals that did not get implanted.

Its location marked the boundary between Willesden and the then Chelsea & Paddington, on which it remains today. It formed part of one of 10 [[manor]]s, most likely Chamberlayne Wood Manor, named after Canon Richard de Camera (''of the Chambers'').<ref name=KGDir>{{cite web|url=http://www.kensalgreendirectory.com/history.php|title=History|publisher=Kensalgreendirectory.com|accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> In the 15th century the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Henry Chichele]] (1414\u20131443), acquired lands in Willesden and Kingsbury. In 1443 he founded [[All Souls' College, Oxford]] and endowed it with the same lands in his will. As a resultant, most of Willesden and Kensal Green remained largely agricultural until the mid-1800s, well into the [[Victorian era]]. In 1805, the construction of the [[Grand Junction Canal]] passed through the district to join the [[Regent's Canal]] at [[Paddington]]. As the combined [[Grand Union Canal]], this allowed passage of commercial freight traffic from the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] to [[London Docks]], and hence onwards to the [[River Thames]]. There were two [[dairy farms]] in Kensal Green by the early 1800s, which expanded greatly after the 1864 [[Act of Parliament]] which made it illegal to keep cattle within the [[City of London]]. Although by the late 1800s residential development had greatly reduced the farmland, still in the 1890s many sheep and pigs were raised in the district. One of the farms later became a [[United Dairies]] [[creamery]], supplied by [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon|milk trains]] from [[Mitre Bridge Junction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22605#n151 |title=Willesden: Economic history &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref>\nSt.John's Church was built on the corner of what is now Harrow Road/Kilburn Lane in 1844 and was extensively refurbished in 2017 and fitted with new bells in anticipation of the 175th anniversary in 2019. The church was followed by a school, now Bales College, and more inns including The Plough on the opposite corner of the junction.\nIn 1832 [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] was incorporated by Act of Parliament and opened in January 1833. This led to a revaluation of the surrounding lands, and in 1835 ecclesiastical commissioners were appointed by the Crown, who reported in 1846 that: \"the larger portion of the Prebendal Estates possess, in our opinion, a value far beyond their present agricultural value.\"<ref name=KGDir/>\n[[File:St. John the Evangelist, Kensal Green - geograph.org.uk - 998127.jpg|thumb|left|St. John the Evangelist]]\nWith enough people living locally to create a new parish, in 1844 [[St John the Evangelist Church, Kensal Green|St. John the Evangelist Church]] in Kilburn Lane was consecrated. The 1851 census records just over 800 people living in the new parish. In the 1860s, Kensal Green manor house, situated where Wakeman Road joins [[Harrow Road]], was demolished. Rapid increase in residential development followed, firstly with land west of Kilburn High Road, followed by the sale of Banister's Farm leading to the development of Bannister Road and Mortimer Road. Unfortunately at this time Kensal Green was suffering huge social problems and had a reputation of being a slum, with 55% off its residents living in poverty and squalor, despite being neighbours to thriving Queen's Park.The rapid residential development led to local commissioners reporting in 1880 that there was inadequate drainage and sewerage facilities, with most houses having only improved access to what were the old agricultural drains. In that same year, All Souls' College started to develop its lands north-west of Kilburn Lane, including All Souls' Avenue and College Road, with adjacent roads being named after leading Fellows of the college, and the installation of new sewerage facilities across the district. The college donated lands on which to build Kensal Rise Reading Room, to commemorate the [[Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], in 1897. Opened by [[United States|American]] author [[Mark Twain]] in 1901, it was later extended and renamed [[Kensal Rise Library]].<ref name=KGDir/>\n\nThe developments of the streets around [[Kensal Rise railway station]] date from the last 10 years of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. Although opened in April 1873 as Kensal Green at Chamberlayne Wood, then a remote dead end road; it was renamed Kensal Rise on 24 May 1890. Just north of the station the National Athletic Ground (one of the many early grounds of [[Queen's Park Rangers]]) opened in 1890. The ground which was later renamed the Kensal Rise Athletic Stadium also hosted cycling and athletics competitions before being turned over to housing in the 1920s. For a brief period before 1914 the Aeroplane Building and Flying Society had its headquarters at Kensal Rise and flew test gliders from the site. Kensal Rise also boasted the Electric Pavilion Cinema <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/15212 |title=Odeon Kensal Rise in London, GB |publisher=Cinema Treasures |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}</ref> which opened in November 1914 and was located on the corner of Chamberlayne Road and Bannister Road.\n\nThe construction of the [[Great Western Railway]] started in 1835, with the first {{convert|22.5|mi}} of line, from [[Paddington station]] to [[Taplow railway station|Maidenhead Bridge station]], opened on 4 June 1838. In 1901, its major carriage washing and servicing facilities and [[Old Oak Common TMD|locomotive depot]] were developed at [[Old Oak Common]], bringing further employment and more immigrants to the district. The first major immigrant population had been [[Irish people]] fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], and then post-[[World War I]]. In [[World War II]], due to the railway facilities, the district suffered greatly from German [[Luftwaffe]] bombing.<ref name=KGDir/>\n\nAfter the war, the area became a refuge for the first [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] born contingent. In the 1960s the College disposed of many freeholds, while retaining land in Willesden. Since the 1980s, the Irish-born community has reduced in size, although the legacy of their presence remains, not least in the number of Irish pubs and organisations and the many thousands with Irish ancestry who continue to populate the area.

Its location marked the boundary between Willesden and the then Chelsea & Paddington, on which it remains today. It formed part of one of 10 [[manor]]s, most likely Chamberlayne Wood Manor, named after Canon Richard de Camera (''of the Chambers'').<ref name=KGDir>{{cite web|url=http://www.kensalgreendirectory.com/history.php|title=History|publisher=Kensalgreendirectory.com|accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> In the 15th century the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Henry Chichele]] (1414\u20131443), acquired lands in Willesden and Kingsbury. In 1443 he founded [[All Souls' College, Oxford]] and endowed it with the same lands in his will. As a resultant, most of Willesden and Kensal Green remained largely agricultural until the mid-1800s, well into the [[Victorian era]]. In 1805, the construction of the [[Grand Junction Canal]] passed through the district to join the [[Regent's Canal]] at [[Paddington]]. As the combined [[Grand Union Canal]], this allowed passage of commercial freight traffic from the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] to [[London Docks]], and hence onwards to the [[River Thames]]. There were two [[dairy farms]] in Kensal Green by the early 1800s, which expanded greatly after the 1864 [[Act of Parliament]] which made it illegal to keep cattle within the [[City of London]]. Although by the late 1800s residential development had greatly reduced the farmland, still in the 1890s many sheep and pigs were raised in the district. One of the farms later became a [[United Dairies]] [[creamery]], supplied by [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon|milk trains]] from [[Mitre Bridge Junction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22605#n151 |title=Willesden: Economic history &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref>\nSt.John's Church was built on the corner of what is now Harrow Road/Kilburn Lane in 1844 and was extensively refurbished in 2017 and fitted with new bells in anticipation of the 175th anniversary in 2019. The church was followed by a school, now Bales College, and more inns including The Plough on the opposite corner of the junction.\nIn 1832 [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] was incorporated by Act of Parliament and opened in January 1833. This led to a revaluation of the surrounding lands, and in 1835 ecclesiastical commissioners were appointed by the Crown, who reported in 1846 that: \"the larger portion of the Prebendal Estates possess, in our opinion, a value far beyond their present agricultural value.\"<ref name=KGDir/>\n[[File:St. John the Evangelist, Kensal Green - geograph.org.uk - 998127.jpg|thumb|left|St. John the Evangelist]]\nWith enough people living locally to create a new parish, in 1844 [[St John the Evangelist Church, Kensal Green|St. John the Evangelist Church]] in Kilburn Lane was consecrated. The 1851 census records just over 800 people living in the new parish. In the 1860s, Kensal Green manor house, situated where Wakeman Road joins [[Harrow Road]], was demolished. Rapid increase in residential development followed, firstly with land west of Kilburn High Road, followed by the sale of Banister's Farm leading to the development of Bannister Road and Mortimer Road. Unfortunately at this time Kensal Green was suffering huge social problems and had a reputation of being a slum, with 55% off its residents living in poverty and squalor, despite being neighbours to thriving Queen's Park.The rapid residential development led to local commissioners reporting in 1880 that there was inadequate drainage and sewerage facilities, with most houses having only improved access to what were the old agricultural drains. In that same year, All Souls' College started to develop its lands north-west of Kilburn Lane, including All Souls' Avenue and College Road, with adjacent roads being named after leading Fellows of the college, and the installation of new sewerage facilities across the district. The college donated lands on which to build Kensal Rise Reading Room, to commemorate the [[Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], in 1897. Opened by [[United States|American]] author [[Mark Twain]] in 1901, it was later extended and renamed [[Kensal Rise Library]].<ref name=KGDir/>\n\nThe developments of the streets around [[Kensal Rise railway station]] date from the last 10 years of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. Although opened in April 1873 as Kensal Green at Chamberlayne Wood, then a remote dead end road; it was renamed Kensal Rise on 24 May 1890. Just north of the station the National Athletic Ground (one of the many early grounds of [[Queen's Park Rangers]]) opened in 1890. The ground which was later renamed the Kensal Rise Athletic Stadium also hosted cycling and athletics competitions before being turned over to housing in the 1920s. For a brief period before 1914 the Aeroplane Building and Flying Society had its headquarters at Kensal Rise and flew test gliders from the site. Kensal Rise also boasted the Electric Pavilion Cinema <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/15212 |title=Odeon Kensal Rise in London, GB |publisher=Cinema Treasures |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}</ref> which opened in November 1914 and was located on the corner of Chamberlayne Road and Bannister Road.\n\nThe construction of the [[Great Western Railway]] started in 1835, with the first {{convert|22.5|mi}} of line, from [[Paddington station]] to [[Taplow railway station|Maidenhead Bridge station]], opened on 4 June 1838. In 1901, its major carriage washing and servicing facilities and [[Old Oak Common TMD|locomotive depot]] were developed at [[Old Oak Common]], bringing further employment and more immigrants to the district. The first major immigrant population had been [[Irish people]] fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], and then post-[[World War I]]. In [[World War II]], due to the railway facilities, the district suffered greatly from German [[Luftwaffe]] bombing.<ref name=KGDir/>\n\nAfter the war, the area became a refuge for the first [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] born contingent. In the 1960s the College disposed of many freeholds, while retaining land in Willesden. Since the 1980s, the Irish-born community has reduced in size, although the legacy of their presence remains, not least in the number of Irish pubs and organisations and the many thousands with Irish ancestry who continue to populate the area. According to statistics from the 2001 census, the area has a very high proportion of young residents (28.4% 25\u201344 years old) and a very high educational level (30.7% hold a first degree or better).<ref>[http://archive.brent.gov.uk/demographic.nsf/Documents/Kensal%20Green%20Ward?openDocument ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070341/http://archive.brent.gov.uk/demographic.nsf/Documents/Kensal%20Green%20Ward?openDocument |date=4 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe area has seen significant gentrification over recent years as people have been priced out of surrounding areas such as Notting Hill.

National Rail [[London Overground]] services also operate to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], a journey that takes around 15 minutes. Trains also go to {{rws|Watford Junction}}.\n\nLondon Overground's [[North London Line]] services also operate out of [[Kensal Rise railway station]] (Transport for London [[Travelcard Zone 2]]) and provides regular services to [[Richmond station, London|Richmond]] in the west, [[Stratford railway station|Stratford]] in the east, and [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]] in the south.\n\nExtensive bus services also run from the area, including routes [[London Buses route 18|18]] (Sudbury - Euston), [[London Buses route 6|6]] (Willesden Bus Garage - [[Aldwych]]), [[London Buses route 52|52]] (Willesden Bus Garage - [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria station]] via [[Notting Hill]] and [[Kensington]]) and [[London Buses route 452|452]] (Kensal Rise - [[Vauxhall]]).\n\nThere is also a canal running from Kensal Rise to Paddington, and to Kings Cross via Camden which features a cycle lane and water bus.\n\nFor a time, the [[London Congestion Charge]] extended into [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]] and reached as far north as Harrow Road, the southern boundary of Kensal Green. Most vehicles travelling south-east down Ladbroke Grove were liable to pay the \u00a38 daily charge between 07.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays, although a loop was created to allow continued free access to the Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket which was technically within the zone.\n\nFollowing a public consultation in the autumn of 2008, the western extension of the congestion charging zone, which had bordered on Kensal Green, was scheduled to be removed. Charging on the western extension effectively ended on 24 December 2010. The effects of this on local trade have not yet been determined.\n\n==Schools==\n[[File:Kenmont Primary School, College Park, Kensal Green.jpg|thumb|Kenmont Primary School]]\nThe educational charity Ark, founded by venture capitalist Arpad Busson, runs three state primary schools in the area, including Ark Franklin in Harvist Road, which replaced Kensal Rise primary in September 2013.

The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back.  Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center. Phases use [[wraparound (video games)|wraparound]], meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side.\n\nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.\n\nThere are four enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into slippery ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number that must be defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal at the start of each new phase.\n\nThe \"POW\" block flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. It can be used three times before it disappears. In the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' in-game Player-Versus-Player version of this minigame, each of the three uses causes the opponent to lose a card and all the enemies to be flipped over. Another feature in this small remake is that the pipes are straight, occasionally spitting out large fireballs at the two plumbers. When any enemy type except a Slipice is defeated, a coin appears and can be picked up for bonus points; however, the phase ends as soon as the last enemy is defeated.\n\nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and icicles form under the platforms and at times on the top of the pipes and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \"POW\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.\n\n==Development==\n[[File: Shigeru Miyamoto GDC 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a middle-aged Japanese man|Shigeru Miyamoto ''(pictured)'' and Gunpei Yokoi collaborated on the design of ''Mario Bros.'']]\n''Mario Bros.'' was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. In ''Donkey Kong'', Mario dies if he falls too far. For ''Mario Bros.'', Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it \"not much of a game.\" He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario \"jumping and bouncing around\", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below.<ref name=\"wii\">{{Cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back.  Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center. Phases use [[wraparound (video games)|wraparound]], meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side.\n\nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.\n\nThere are four enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into slippery ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number that must be defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal at the start of each new phase.\n\nThe \"POW\" block flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. It can be used three times before it disappears. In the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' in-game Player-Versus-Player version of this minigame, each of the three uses causes the opponent to lose a card and all the enemies to be flipped over. Another feature in this small remake is that the pipes are straight, occasionally spitting out large fireballs at the two plumbers. When any enemy type except a Slipice is defeated, a coin appears and can be picked up for bonus points; however, the phase ends as soon as the last enemy is defeated.\n\nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and icicles form under the platforms and at times on the top of the pipes and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \"POW\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.\n\n==Development==\n[[File: Shigeru Miyamoto GDC 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a middle-aged Japanese man|Shigeru Miyamoto ''(pictured)'' and Gunpei Yokoi collaborated on the design of ''Mario Bros.'']]\n''Mario Bros.'' was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. In ''Donkey Kong'', Mario dies if he falls too far. For ''Mario Bros.'', Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it \"not much of a game.\" He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario \"jumping and bouncing around\", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below.<ref name=\"wii\">{{Cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.
