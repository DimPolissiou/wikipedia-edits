Beyond this time both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis-based metabolic systems begin to predominate.\n\nThe by-product of anaerobic glycolysis&mdash;lactate&mdash;has traditionally been thought to be detrimental to muscle function.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Westerblad|first1=H\u00e5kan|title=Muscle Fatigue: Lactic Acid or Inorganic Phosphate the Major Cause?|journal=Physiology|date=1 February 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=17\u201321|doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.2002.17.1.17|pmid=11821531}}</ref> However, this appears likely only when lactate levels are very high.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Sony Urban Music]]. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and [[ballad]]s that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among [[music journalism|music critics]] who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. ''Destiny Fulfilled'' spawned four singles\u2014the [[lead single]] \"[[Lose My Breath]]\", \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\", \"[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]\" and \"[[Cater 2 U]]\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be.

This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.<ref name=\"MossReunited\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml |title=Destiny\u2019s Child: Reunited And It Fells So Good |last=Moss |first=Corey |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"<ref name=\"Benson\"/>\n\n== Production and recording ==\nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album ''Dangerously in Love'', concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/>\n\nDiffering from ''Survivor'' in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in ''Destiny Fulfilled'', their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\"<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places&nbsp;... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"<ref name=\"MossShut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1489338/destinys-child-back-in-the-studio-so-shut-up-kelly-rowland-says/|title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\"<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by [[The Emotions]], [[Jodeci]] and [[SWV]] mixing elements of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493304/beyonce-salutes-jay-z-on-destinys-child-track-soldier/|title=Beyonce Salutes Jay-Z On Destiny\u2019s Child Track 'Soldier'|publisher=MTV News.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Sony Urban Music]]. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and [[ballad]]s that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among [[music journalism|music critics]] who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. ''Destiny Fulfilled'' spawned four singles\u2014the [[lead single]] \"[[Lose My Breath]]\", \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\", \"[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]\" and \"[[Cater 2 U]]\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be. Women can get along and be businesswomen and be smart and not be catty all the time.\"\n |align  = left\n |width  = 25%\n |source =\u2014Beyonc\u00e9<ref name=\"MossReunited\" />\n}}\n\nWhile recording their third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' in late 2000, [[Beyonc\u00e9]] announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group.<ref>{{cite news|last=VanHorn|first=Teri|title=Destiny's Child Solo CDs Won't Compete With Group, Each Other|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1375037/destinys-child-solo-cds-wont-compete-with-group-each-other/|publisher=MTV News.

This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.<ref name=\"MossReunited\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml |title=Destiny\u2019s Child: Reunited And It Fells So Good |last=Moss |first=Corey |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"<ref name=\"Benson\"/>\n\n== Production and recording ==\nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album ''Dangerously in Love'', concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/>\n\nDiffering from ''Survivor'' in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in ''Destiny Fulfilled'', their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\"<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places&nbsp;... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"<ref name=\"MossShut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1489338/destinys-child-back-in-the-studio-so-shut-up-kelly-rowland-says/|title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nDuring an interview with [[MTV]], Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\"<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by [[The Emotions]], [[Jodeci]] and [[SWV]] mixing elements of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493304/beyonce-salutes-jay-z-on-destinys-child-track-soldier/|title=Beyonce Salutes Jay-Z On Destiny\u2019s Child Track 'Soldier'|publisher=MTV News.

This ingested iodine is bound to serum proteins, especially to [[albumin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The rest of the iodine which remains unlinked and free in bloodstream, is removed from the body through urine (the [[kidney]] is essential in the removal of iodine from extracellular space).\n\nIodine uptake is a result of an [[active transport]] mechanism mediated by the NIS protein, which is found in the [[Basolateral membrane#Membrane polarity|basolateral membrane]] of thyroid follicular cells. As a result of this active transport, iodide concentration inside follicular cells of thyroid tissue is 20 to 50 times higher than in the plasma. The transport of iodide across the cell membrane is driven by the [[electrochemical gradient]] of sodium (the intracellular concentration of sodium is approximately 12 mM and extracellular concentration 140 mM). Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide diffuses to the apical membrane, where it is metabolically oxidized through the action of [[thyroid peroxidase]] to iodinium (I<sup>+</sup>) which in turn iodinates [[tyrosine]] residues of the [[thyroglobulin]] proteins in the follicle colloid. Thus, NIS is essential for the synthesis of [[thyroid hormones]] (T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>).\n[[File:Thyroid hormone synthesis.png|thumb|left|[[Thyroid hormone synthesis]], with the ''Na/I symporter'' seen at right.]]\n\nApart from thyroid cells NIS can also be found, although less expressed, in other tissues such as the [[salivary glands]], the [[gastric mucosa]], the kidney, the [[placenta]], the [[ovaries]] and the [[mammary glands]] during pregnancy and lactation. NIS expression in the mammary glands is quite a relevant fact since the regulation of iodide absorption and its presence in the breast milk is the main source of iodine for a newborn. Note that the regulation of NIS expression in thyroid is done by the [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), whereas in breast is done by a combination of three molecules: [[prolactin]], [[oxytocin]] and [[estradiol|\u03b2-estradiol]].\n\n==Inhibition by Environmental Chemicals==\nSome anions like [[perchlorate]], [[pertechnetate]] and [[thiocyanate]], can  affect iodide capture by [[competitive inhibition]] because they can use the symporter when their concentration in plasma is high, even though they have less affinity for NIS than iodide has. Many plant [[cyanogenic glycosides]], which are important pesticides, also act via inhibition of NIS in a large part of animal cells of herbivores and parasites and not in plant cells. Some evidence suggests that fluoride, such as that present in drinking water, may decrease cellular expression of the sodium/iodide symporter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waugh DT | title = Fluoride Exposure Induces Inhibition of Sodium/Iodide Symporter (NIS) Contributing to Impaired Iodine Absorption and Iodine Deficiency: Molecular Mechanisms of Inhibition and Implications for Public Health | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 1086 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30917615 | pmc = 6466022 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph16061086 }}</ref>\n\nUsing a validated ''in vitro'' radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) assay,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallinger DR, Murr AS, Buckalew AR, Simmons SO, Stoker TE, Laws SC | title = Development of a screening approach to detect thyroid disrupting chemicals that inhibit the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS) | journal = Toxicology in Vitro | volume = 40 | pages = 66\u201378 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27979590 | doi = 10.1016/j.tiv.2016.12.006 }}</ref> the Besides the traditionally known anions such as perchlorate, organic chemicals may also pose inhibition of iodide uptake via NIS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Hallinger DR, Murr AS, Buckalew AR, Simmons SO, Laws SC, Stoker TE | title = High-Throughput Screening and Quantitative Chemical Ranking for Sodium-Iodide Symporter Inhibitors in ToxCast Phase I Chemical Library | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 9 | pages = 5417\u20135426 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29611697 | doi = 10.1021/acs.est.7b06145 | bibcode = 2018EnST...52.5417W | pmc = 6697091 }}</ref>\n\n== Regulation in iodine uptake ==\nThe iodine transport mechanisms are closely submitted to the regulation of NIS expression. There are two kinds of regulation on NIS expression: positive and negative regulation. Positive regulation depends on TSH, which acts by transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. On the other hand, negative regulation depends on the plasmatic concentrations of iodide.\n\n=== Transcriptional regulation ===\nAt a transcriptional level, TSH regulates the thyroid's function through [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. TSH first binds to its receptors which are joined to G proteins, and then induces the activation of the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]], which will raise the intracellular levels of cAMP. This can activate the [[CREB]] transcription factor (cAMP Response Element-Binding) that will bind to the CRE (cAMP Responsive Element). However, this might not occur and, instead, the increase in cAMP can be followed by [[Protein kinase A|PKA]] (Protein kinase A) activation and, as a result, the activation of the transcription factor [[PAX8|Pax8]] after [[phosphorylation]].\n\nThese two transcription factors influence the activity of NUE (NIS Upstream Enhancer), which is essential for initiating transcription of NIS. NUE's activity depends on 4 relevant sites which have been identified by mutational analysis. The transcriptional factor Pax8 binds in two of these sites. Pax8 mutations lead to a decrease in the transcriptional activity of NUE.<ref name=\"pmid10022892\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohno M, Zannini M, Levy O, Carrasco N, di Lauro R | title = The paired-domain transcription factor Pax8 binds to the upstream enhancer of the rat sodium/iodide symporter gene and participates in both thyroid-specific and cyclic-AMP-dependent transcription | journal = Mol.

Therefore, the iodide uptake is reduced.\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Thyroid diseases ==\nThe lack of iodide transport inside follicular cells tends to cause [[goitre]]s. There are some mutations in the NIS [[DNA]] that cause [[hypothyroidism]] and [[thyroid dyshormonogenesis]].\n\nMoreover, antibodies anti-NIS have been found in thyroid [[autoimmune disease]]s. Using [[RT-PCR]] tests, it has been proved that there is no expression of NIS in cancer cells (which forms a [[thyroid carcinoma]]). Nevertheless, thanks to immunohistochemical techniques it is known that NIS is not functional in these cells, since it is mainly localized in the cytosol, and not in the basolateral membrane.\n\nThere is also a connection between the V600E mutation of the [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] oncogene and [[papillary thyroid cancer]] that cannot concentrate iodine into its follicular cells.\n\n== Use with radioiodine (<sup>131</sup>I) ==\nThe main goal for the treatment of non-thyroid carcinoma is the research of less aggressive procedures that could also provide less toxicity. One of these therapies is based on transferring NIS in cancer cells of different origin (breast, colon, prostate...) using adenoviruses or retroviruses ([[viral vector]]s). This genetic technique is called [[gene targeting]]. Once NIS is transferred in these cells, the patient is treated with radioiodine (<sup>131</sup>I), being the result a low cancer cell survival rate. Therefore, a lot is expected from these therapies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Symporter]]\n* [[Solute carrier family]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin | 2}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://webs.uvigo.es/endocrinologia/PDFs%202004_05/PDFS/Tiroides_PSantisteban.pdf | title = Mecanismos Moleculares Implicados en la Funci\u00f3n Tiroidea: Control de Procesos Fisiol\u00f3gicos y Alteraciones Pathol\u00f3gicas | trans-title = Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Thyroid Function: Physiological Process Control and Pathological Alterations | author = Santisteban P | publisher = Universidad de Vigo | accessdate = 2011-11-18 | language = Spanish | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406181559/http://webs.uvigo.es/endocrinologia/PDFs%202004_05/PDFS/Tiroides_PSantisteban.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-06 }}\n* {{cite book | title = Tiroides |trans-title=Thyroid | edition = 2nd | veditors = Carlos D, Rafael Y | chapter = Fisiolog\u00eda del tiroides |trans-chapter=Thyroid Physiology | year = 2007| publisher = McGRAW-HILL \u2013 INTERAMERICANA | location = Aravaca (Madrid) | isbn = | pages = 1\u201330 | url = | language = Spanish }}\n* {{cite book | editor = Jameson JL | title = Harrison's Endocrinology | vauthors = Jameson JL, Weetman AP | chapter = Disorders of the Thyroid Gland | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = | year = 2010 | pages = 62\u201398 | isbn = 978-0-07-174144-6 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}\n*{{cite journal  | vauthors=Fukushima K, Kaneko CR, Fuchs AF |title=The neuronal substrate of integration in the oculomotor system |journal=Prog.

This ingested iodine is bound to serum proteins, especially to [[albumin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The rest of the iodine which remains unlinked and free in bloodstream, is removed from the body through urine (the [[kidney]] is essential in the removal of iodine from extracellular space).\n\nIodine uptake is a result of an [[active transport]] mechanism mediated by the NIS protein, which is found in the [[Basolateral membrane#Membrane polarity|basolateral membrane]] of thyroid follicular cells. As a result of this active transport, iodide concentration inside follicular cells of thyroid tissue is 20 to 50 times higher than in the plasma. The transport of iodide across the cell membrane is driven by the [[electrochemical gradient]] of sodium (the intracellular concentration of sodium is approximately 12 mM and extracellular concentration 140 mM). Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide diffuses to the apical membrane, where it is metabolically oxidized through the action of [[thyroid peroxidase]] to iodinium (I<sup>+</sup>) which in turn iodinates [[tyrosine]] residues of the [[thyroglobulin]] proteins in the follicle colloid. Thus, NIS is essential for the synthesis of [[thyroid hormones]] (T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>).\n[[File:Thyroid hormone synthesis.png|thumb|left|[[Thyroid hormone synthesis]], with the ''Na/I symporter'' seen at right.]]\n\nApart from thyroid cells NIS can also be found, although less expressed, in other tissues such as the [[salivary glands]], the [[gastric mucosa]], the kidney, the [[placenta]], the [[ovaries]] and the [[mammary glands]] during pregnancy and lactation. NIS expression in the mammary glands is quite a relevant fact since the regulation of iodide absorption and its presence in the breast milk is the main source of iodine for a newborn. Note that the regulation of NIS expression in thyroid is done by the [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), whereas in breast is done by a combination of three molecules: [[prolactin]], [[oxytocin]] and [[estradiol|\u03b2-estradiol]].\n\n==Inhibition by Environmental Chemicals==\nSome anions like [[perchlorate]], [[pertechnetate]] and [[thiocyanate]], can  affect iodide capture by [[competitive inhibition]] because they can use the symporter when their concentration in plasma is high, even though they have less affinity for NIS than iodide has. Many plant [[cyanogenic glycosides]], which are important pesticides, also act via inhibition of NIS in a large part of animal cells of herbivores and parasites and not in plant cells. Some evidence suggests that fluoride, such as that present in drinking water, may decrease cellular expression of the sodium/iodide symporter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waugh DT | title = Fluoride Exposure Induces Inhibition of Sodium/Iodide Symporter (NIS) Contributing to Impaired Iodine Absorption and Iodine Deficiency: Molecular Mechanisms of Inhibition and Implications for Public Health | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 1086 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30917615 | pmc = 6466022 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph16061086 }}</ref>\n\nUsing a validated ''in vitro'' radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) assay,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallinger DR, Murr AS, Buckalew AR, Simmons SO, Stoker TE, Laws SC | title = Development of a screening approach to detect thyroid disrupting chemicals that inhibit the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS) | journal = Toxicology in Vitro | volume = 40 | pages = 66\u201378 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27979590 | doi = 10.1016/j.tiv.2016.12.006 }}</ref> the Besides the traditionally known anions such as perchlorate, organic chemicals may also pose inhibition of iodide uptake via NIS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Hallinger DR, Murr AS, Buckalew AR, Simmons SO, Laws SC, Stoker TE | title = High-Throughput Screening and Quantitative Chemical Ranking for Sodium-Iodide Symporter Inhibitors in ToxCast Phase I Chemical Library | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 9 | pages = 5417\u20135426 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29611697 | doi = 10.1021/acs.est.7b06145 | bibcode = 2018EnST...52.5417W | pmc = 6697091 }}</ref>\n\n== Regulation in iodine uptake ==\nThe iodine transport mechanisms are closely submitted to the regulation of NIS expression. There are two kinds of regulation on NIS expression: positive and negative regulation. Positive regulation depends on TSH, which acts by transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. On the other hand, negative regulation depends on the plasmatic concentrations of iodide.\n\n=== Transcriptional regulation ===\nAt a transcriptional level, TSH regulates the thyroid's function through [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. TSH first binds to its receptors which are joined to G proteins, and then induces the activation of the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]], which will raise the intracellular levels of cAMP. This can activate the [[CREB]] transcription factor (cAMP Response Element-Binding) that will bind to the CRE (cAMP Responsive Element). However, this might not occur and, instead, the increase in cAMP can be followed by [[Protein kinase A|PKA]] (Protein kinase A) activation and, as a result, the activation of the transcription factor [[PAX8|Pax8]] after [[phosphorylation]].\n\nThese two transcription factors influence the activity of NUE (NIS Upstream Enhancer), which is essential for initiating transcription of NIS. NUE's activity depends on 4 relevant sites which have been identified by mutational analysis. The transcriptional factor Pax8 binds in two of these sites. Pax8 mutations lead to a decrease in the transcriptional activity of NUE.<ref name=\"pmid10022892\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohno M, Zannini M, Levy O, Carrasco N, di Lauro R | title = The paired-domain transcription factor Pax8 binds to the upstream enhancer of the rat sodium/iodide symporter gene and participates in both thyroid-specific and cyclic-AMP-dependent transcription | journal = Mol.

Therefore, the iodide uptake is reduced.\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Thyroid diseases ==\nThe lack of iodide transport inside follicular cells tends to cause [[goitre]]s. There are some mutations in the NIS [[DNA]] that cause [[hypothyroidism]] and [[thyroid dyshormonogenesis]].\n\nMoreover, antibodies anti-NIS have been found in thyroid [[autoimmune disease]]s. Using [[RT-PCR]] tests, it has been proved that there is no expression of NIS in cancer cells (which forms a [[thyroid carcinoma]]). Nevertheless, thanks to immunohistochemical techniques it is known that NIS is not functional in these cells, since it is mainly localized in the cytosol, and not in the basolateral membrane.\n\nThere is also a connection between the V600E mutation of the [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] oncogene and [[papillary thyroid cancer]] that cannot concentrate iodine into its follicular cells.\n\n== Use with radioiodine (<sup>131</sup>I) ==\nThe main goal for the treatment of non-thyroid carcinoma is the research of less aggressive procedures that could also provide less toxicity. One of these therapies is based on transferring NIS in cancer cells of different origin (breast, colon, prostate...) using adenoviruses or retroviruses ([[viral vector]]s). This genetic technique is called [[gene targeting]]. Once NIS is transferred in these cells, the patient is treated with radioiodine (<sup>131</sup>I), being the result a low cancer cell survival rate. Therefore, a lot is expected from these therapies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Symporter]]\n* [[Solute carrier family]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin | 2}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://webs.uvigo.es/endocrinologia/PDFs%202004_05/PDFS/Tiroides_PSantisteban.pdf | title = Mecanismos Moleculares Implicados en la Funci\u00f3n Tiroidea: Control de Procesos Fisiol\u00f3gicos y Alteraciones Pathol\u00f3gicas | trans-title = Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Thyroid Function: Physiological Process Control and Pathological Alterations | author = Santisteban P | publisher = Universidad de Vigo | accessdate = 2011-11-18 | language = Spanish | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406181559/http://webs.uvigo.es/endocrinologia/PDFs%202004_05/PDFS/Tiroides_PSantisteban.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-06 }}\n* {{cite book | title = Tiroides |trans-title=Thyroid | edition = 2nd | veditors = Carlos D, Rafael Y | chapter = Fisiolog\u00eda del tiroides |trans-chapter=Thyroid Physiology | year = 2007| publisher = McGRAW-HILL \u2013 INTERAMERICANA | location = Aravaca (Madrid) | isbn = | pages = 1\u201330 | url = | language = Spanish }}\n* {{cite book | editor = Jameson JL | title = Harrison's Endocrinology | vauthors = Jameson JL, Weetman AP | chapter = Disorders of the Thyroid Gland | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = | year = 2010 | pages = 62\u201398 | isbn = 978-0-07-174144-6 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}\n*{{cite journal  | vauthors=Fukushima K, Kaneko CR, Fuchs AF |title=The neuronal substrate of integration in the oculomotor system |journal=Prog.

{"title_page": "Marianne Mathy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Marianne Mathy-Frisdane''' (23 June 1890 &ndash; 18 October 1978) was a coloratura soprano opera singer and distinguished teacher of opera and classical singing.\n\nBorn Marianne Helene Sara Kahn in Mannheim, Germany, in 1913 Marianne married Colonel Eric Mathy, an officer of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s Imperial German Army. Though they divorced the next year, with Eric killed in action shortly thereafter, Marianne retained Mathy's name for the remainder of her life. In 1921, she married Berlin architect, Franz (Francis) Martin Friendenstein. They later changed this name by deed poll in February 1945 from Friendenstein to Frisdane.\n\nHer musical education included piano, theory, speech training, interpretation and voice production, with a special course for the treatment of damaged vocal cords. Though her initial formal training emphasised piano, Marianne showed early promise as an opera and classical singer. In 1918 Marianne was offered her first engagement singing at a provincial opera, as Gretel in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]''. She became well known as an interpreter of Lieder and of early music. She went on to perform in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 Marianne received the State Certificate, Berlin, with Honourable Mention in recognition of her public performances and as a teacher of singing.\n\nIn October 1939, Marianne and Francis emigrated to [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. From 1959, Mathy-Frisdane taught for three years at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA), and for over 12 years at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music (now [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]]), and participated in the inaugural meeting for the New South Wales National Opera, the predecessor of the Australian Opera (now [[Opera Australia]]). In 1963, she was commissioned by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust to make a new English translation of [[Charles Gounod]]'s opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''.\n\nA highly respected teacher of opera and classical singers, Mathy taught fifteen winners of the [[Sydney Sun Aria Competition]]. In 1965 she wrote ''The Singer's Companion''.<ref>''The Singer's Companion'', Van Dyke Productions, Sydney, 1965</ref><ref>''The Singer's Companion'', [http://www.catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2788097 National Library of Australia Catalogue, Bib ID 2788097]</ref> Many of her pupils became nationally and internationally renowned opera singers and include Althea Bridges, [[June Bronhill]], [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Peter Cousens]] and [[Lyndon Terracini]].\n\nMarianne Mathy-Fridane left in her will a bequest from which the Marianne Mathy Scholarship for young opera and classical singers was established. First awarded in 1982 to New Zealand soprano Nicola Waite, the Scholarship, also known as ''The Mathy'', is one of the longest-running, recognised and respected scholarships of its type in Australia and New Zealand. The Mathy is the major award in the [[Australian Singing Competition]].
