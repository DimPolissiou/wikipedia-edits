In 1821, the rest of the present-day Northwest Territories and Nunavut south of the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic coast]] was added to the charter. Then, in 1870, the Hudson's Bay Company transferred title to its lands to Canada with its purchase of [[Rupert's Land]]. Thus, the new dominion acquired legal sovereignty over all of what is now northern Canada except for the Arctic islands. This northern mainland sovereignty has never been questioned although there have been challenges to Canada's Arctic sovereignty in the past.<ref name = \"Morrison\"/>\n\nIn 1880 the government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] transferred to Canada the rest of its possessions in the Arctic, including \"all Islands adjacent to any such Territories\" whether discovered by British or foreigners, or not yet discovered.<ref name = \"Morrison\"/>\n\nFurther historical information related to Canadian Arctic policy can be found in the sections which follow.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Arctic (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|300px|The Arctic region]]\n\n===Definition of Arctic===\nThe term \"Arctic\" varies in its usage.

Most recently, Canada's claims that the marine passageways within the Archipelago are Canadian internal waters have been actively challenged by the United States, who claims instead that these are international waters.\n\nIn 1969, the [[SS Manhattan (1962)|SS ''Manhattan'']] and, in 1985, the [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|''Polar Sea'']], both United States ships, sparked controversy in Canada by traveling through the waters of the Arctic Archipelago without the permission of Canada. Due to the remoteness of the area and a lack of capacity, Canada did not learn of the voyages until after they had occurred, a clear challenge to Canada's arctic claims. In the aftermath of both incidents, Canada strengthened its legislation covering such voyages and devoted additional attention to developing its capacity (both military and otherwise) for operating in the Arctic in support of its sovereignty claims.\n\n==Economic and social development==\nThe Inuit have been hunters for millennia.

This station will be built as an integral part of Canada's [[Northern Strategy]] and serves political purposes, such as asserting Canada's sovereignty in the high north, as much as concrete research objectives.

Most recently, Canada's claims that the marine passageways within the Archipelago are Canadian internal waters have been actively challenged by the United States, who claims instead that these are international waters.\n\nIn 1969, the [[SS Manhattan (1962)|SS ''Manhattan'']] and, in 1985, the [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|''Polar Sea'']], both United States ships, sparked controversy in Canada by traveling through the waters of the Arctic Archipelago without the permission of Canada. Due to the remoteness of the area and a lack of capacity, Canada did not learn of the voyages until after they had occurred, a clear challenge to Canada's arctic claims. In the aftermath of both incidents, Canada strengthened its legislation covering such voyages and devoted additional attention to developing its capacity (both military and otherwise) for operating in the Arctic in support of its sovereignty claims.\n\n==Economic and social development==\nThe Inuit have been hunters for millennia.

His Fifth and Sixth Forms were an improvement, but he was still described in school reports as \"[a] confident and at times helpful boy.  Sometimes irritates.  Sometimes works hard\" (1964), and \"[a] keen, pleasant, though sometimes erratic boy\" (1965).<ref>Tony Parkinson, ''Jeff: The Rise and Fall of a Political Phenomenon'', Ringwood: Penguin, 2000, p.19.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school, Kennett was persuaded by his father Ken to attend the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], but lost interest and left after one year of an economics degree. He returned to [[Melbourne]] and found work in the advertising department of the retail giant [[Myer]] \u2013 kindling an interest for advertising that would one day earn him his living.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jef'', pp.22\u201323.</ref>\n\nKennett's life in the regular workforce was cut short when, in 1968, he was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Australian Army]].<ref>Parkinson, ''Jef'', p.24.</ref>  Kennett was singled out as 'officer material' early in his career, and graduated third in his class from the [[Officer Training Unit, Scheyville]] (OTU) [[Scheyville, New South Wales|Scheyville]], near [[Windsor, New South Wales]], outside [[Sydney]]. He was posted to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] as Second Lieutenant, commander of 1st Platoon, A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR).<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', pp.25, 29.</ref> This military career (and his earlier experience in the Scotch College Cadet Corps) has been noted by many biographers as an essential formative influence on the adult Kennett's character.

Having returned to Myer, Kennett became impatient with his work, and so with Ian Fegan and Eran Nicols, he formed his own advertising company (KNF) in June 1971.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', p.36.</ref>\n\nThereafter, in December 1972, Kennett married Felicity Kellar, an old friend whom he had first met on a Number 69 tram on the long trips to school.<ref>Neales, S., \"Jeff's Friend Flicka\", ''The Good Weekend'', 2 November 1996, pp.30\u201333.</ref> Their first son, Ed, was born in 1974, followed by a daughter Amy, and two more sons, Angus and Ross.\n\n== Political career ==\nKennett was elected as a [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal]] Member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) for [[Electoral district of Burwood|Burwood]] in 1976, having had an interest in local politics since the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\">Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366.</ref> His [[preselection]] for the seat reportedly irritated then [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]] [[Rupert Hamer|Dick Hamer]], who disliked Kennett's campaigning style, and had endorsed the sitting member, [[Haddon Storey]].<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\"/> However by 1981, Kennett was promoted to Cabinet as Minister for Housing, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He was one of several younger MPs whom Hamer promoted to Cabinet in a bid to renew his government. Kennett retained his post when Hamer was replaced as Liberal leader and Premier by [[Lindsay Thompson]] in June of that year.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\"/> Following the defeat of the longstanding Liberal government in 1982, Kennett was the leading candidate to replace Thompson despite being the youngest member of the outgoing government. On 26 October, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party and hence Leader of the Opposition. He took an aggressive posture against the [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria)|Cain]] government, and was often criticised for his \"bull-in-a-china-shop\" style and his anti-government rhetoric.<ref>Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', pp.367 & Cartoon 10 between pp.146\u2013147.</ref>\n\nUnder his leadership, the Liberals were heavily defeated by Labor in [[1985 Victorian state election|1985]].  Afterwards he faced a challenge to his leadership of the party from [[Ian Smith (Australian politician)|Ian Smith]]. Kennett survived easily, but increasingly, he was seen as an erratic and unapproachable leader. He faced two more challenges to his leadership in 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368\"/> In 1987, in one notable incident Kennett referred to the Federal Liberal leader [[John Howard]] using colourful language in a mobile telephone conversation with Howard rival [[Andrew Peacock]].<ref>australianpolitics.com (1995\u20132006)</ref> The car-phone conversation damaged both Howard and Kennett politically, but aided Peacock in his push to return as Federal Liberal leader (1989).<ref>[http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/vic/87-03-23_car-phone.shtml Kennett-Peacock Car Phone Conversation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212172222/http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/vic/87-03-23_car-phone.shtml |date=12 December 2004 }}. Retrieved 5 May 2006.</ref>\n\nToward the end of its second term the Cain government had lost support and the Liberals were expected to win the [[1988 Victorian state election|1988 election]]. The Liberal vote indeed rebounded strongly \u2013 they won a majority of the two-party vote \u2013 however much of this margin was wasted on landslide majorities in their heartland. As a result, the Liberals took only one seat from Labor in the capital, and were left four seats short of a majority. Failing to become premier, Kennett was again criticised within his own party, and in 1989 he was deposed in favour of a little-known rural MLA, [[Alan Brown (Australian politician)|Alan Brown]].\n\nKennett's performance during his first stint as Liberal leader is a matter of debate. [[Nick Economou|Economou]] sees his 1985 and 1988 election campaigns as weak,<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368\">Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368.</ref> while Parkinson believes he was a significant asset in pushing the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] government of [[John Cain II|John Cain]] in several key seats. Kennett's reputation as a campaigner grew over time and by the mid 2000s was almost universally acknowledged to be perhaps a better campaigner than any of the many Liberal campaigners that had come before him. Many have described him as 'a complete campaigner'.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', pp.69\u201371.</ref>\n\n===First term as premier===\nKennett publicly pledged never to attempt a return to the Liberal leadership. However, when Brown proved unable to challenge the government effectively, he allowed his supporters to call a spill in 1991. Brown realised he didn't have enough support to keep his post and resigned, allowing Kennett to retake the leadership unopposed.\n\nWith Victoria reeling under billions of dollars of debt, Kennett was seen as \"Premier-in-waiting\" from the moment he retook the leadership. Cain had resigned a year earlier in favour of Deputy Premier [[Joan Kirner]], who was unable to regain the upper hand despite being personally more popular than Kennett. The Liberals' advantage was strengthened by an important decision taken during Brown's brief tenure as leader\u2014negotiating a [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] agreement with the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 Victoria|National Party]]. The Liberals and Nationals have historically had a strained relationship in Victoria; they had sat separately for most of the second half of the 20th century. Indeed, it had been believed that Kennett had been denied victory in 1988 due to a large number of three-cornered contests in rural seats.\n\nThe Coalition went into the [[1992 Victorian state election|October 1992 state election]] as unbeatable favourites, having been ahead in opinion polling by large margins for almost two years. They stoked the voters' anger with a series of \"Guilty Party\" ads, targeting many Labor ministers and highlighting concerns in their portfolios. In the second-largest defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria, the Coalition scored a 19-seat swing, attaining a 16-seat majority in the Legislative Assembly. The Liberals won 52 seats, enough for a majority in their own right. Although Kennett could have governed alone, he supported his coalition partner, retaining the Nationals in his cabinet.\n\n====Privatisation====\nIn office, Kennett immediately instituted a budget-cutting and privatisation program in an effort to improve the State's economy. Having assumed office, the need for such action was justified by Kennett and his new [[Treasurer of Victoria|Treasurer]], [[Alan Stockdale]] who discovered that the outgoing government had left them with $2.2 billion budget deficit, a net public sector debt of $33 billion and budget sector debt of $16 billion. To bring down the deficit and control debt, public sector would be reduced, with some 50,000 public servants being retrenched between 1992 and 1995. Critic, former Mayor of [[Brighton, Victoria]] John Locco stated in 2005 \"Kennett decided in his socially demented way that everything had to be privatised.\" <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/icebergers-taking-the-heat-of-competition/2005/12/10/1134086848680.html | title=Icebergers taking the heat of competition| date=11 December 2005}}</ref>\n\n====State school closures====\nIn the first three years of office, funding for public schools and the Department of Education was substantially reduced. 350 government schools were closed, and 7,000 teaching jobs eliminated.<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/000000771.htm Article Title ; STRUGGLE FOR A NEW PUBLIC DEMOCRACY School, Community and the State], by Tony Knight.

The sale of the [[Totalisator Agency Board]] raised $609 million. Between 1995 and 1998, $29 billion of state assets in gas and electricity alone were sold to private enterprise (for statistics, see Parkinson, ''Jeff'', 1999).<ref>http://www.dtf.vic.au/CA25713E0002EF43/WebObj/BP4Final/$File/BPFinal.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nIn the wake of these changes, investment and population growth slowly resumed, though [[unemployment]] was to remain above the national average for the duration of Kennett's premiership. While the benefits to the State budget figures were indisputable in the short term, the social and longer-term economic cost of the Kennett reforms have been questioned by many commentators, academics and those who suffered economically through the period of reform.<ref name=\"crikey.com.au\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2012/07/03/carbon-price-v-privatisation-which-is-worse-in-the-latrobe/|title=Carbon price v privatisation \u2013 which is worse in the Latrobe?|date=3 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"newsweekly.com.au\">{{Cite web | url=http://newsweekly.com.au/article.php?id=4292 |title = ECONOMIC AFFAIRS: Privatisation has failed to deliver cheaper electricity}}</ref><ref name=\"theage.com.au\">{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/1-billion-nightmare-20110121-1a026.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title= Billion Nightmare}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/on-track-for-more-of-the-same-20090627-d0ho.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=On track for more of the same}}</ref>  This campaign of privatisations and cutbacks led to governmental acts of privatisation or budget-cutting becoming popularly known as being \"Jeffed\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/1997/week06/1825.htm |title = Hansard of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/1997/week11/3569.htm |title = Hansard of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT}}</ref>\n\nThe largest public [[protest]] in Melbourne since the [[Vietnam War]] Moratorium occurred on 10 November 1992, with an estimated 100,000 people marching in opposition to the retrenchment of many workers and the large State budget cutbacks.

Other projects, made possible in monetary terms by the early cutbacks and budget restructuring, included a $160 million expansion of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]; $100 million for refurbishment of the State Library of Victoria; $65 million for a new [[Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre]] (MSAC); and $130 million for the construction of a new civic square on the site of the old [[Gas and Fuel Buildings]], to be known as [[Federation Square]].\n\nThe relocation of the [[Australian Grand Prix|Formula 1 Grand Prix]] from [[Adelaide]] in 1993 was a particular coup for Kennett, who had worked hard with his friend [[Ron Walker (Australian businessman)|Ron Walker]], the Chairman of the Melbourne Major Events Company, helped deliver Melbourne the hosting rights for the event from Adelaide in 1993.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/grand-prix-got-victoria-on-the-move-again-kennett-20100319-qm8q.html Grand prix got Victoria on the move again: Kennett], By Jason Dowling, 20 March 2010, The Age</ref>\n\nThe most controversial project of the Kennett era was the $1.85 billion [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex]], a gambling and entertainment centre on Melbourne's [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]]. Initial plans for a casino had been made under the Labor government, however the tendering process and construction occurred under Kennett. Allegations of financial inconsistencies in the tendering process (which eventually saw longtime Kennett supporters Ron Walker and [[Lloyd J. Williams|Lloyd Williams]] successful) were to dog the Kennett government for many years, despite the verdict of an enquiry which found no wrongdoing on its behalf.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nA $2 billion project to redevelop Melbourne's derelict [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] area to include a [[Docklands Stadium|new football stadium]] was also undertaken, in addition to the large [[CityLink]] project, a project resurrected from the [[1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan]], aimed at linking Melbourne's freeways, easing traffic problems in the inner city, and reducing commuting times from the outer suburbs to the CBD.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Second term as premier===\nKennett's personal popularity was mostly average to high through his first term, though that of the government as a whole went through peaks and troughs. Without a [[by-election]] in the previous four years, the [[1996 Victorian state election|1996 state election]] shaped up as the first test of the 'Kennett Revolution' with the electorate. The Coalition was expected to win a second term at the 30 March election, albeit with a somewhat reduced majority.  At the [[1996 Australian federal election|federal election]] held four weeks earlier, while Labor was heavily defeated, it actually picked up a swing in Victoria.\n\nHowever, to the surprise of most commentators, the Coalition only suffered a two-seat swing, allowing it to retain a comfortable 14-seat majority. The Coalition actually picked up modest swings in Melbourne's outer suburbs, which have traditionally decided most state elections. Several negative trends (for the Liberals) were obscured somewhat by the euphoria of victory. The government's sharp cuts to government services were particularly resented in country Victoria, where the Liberals and Nationals held almost all the seats. The loss of the [[Electoral district of Mildura|Mildura]] seat to independent [[Russell Savage]] was an indication of this disaffection, and when in February 1997 independent [[Susan Davies]] was elected to the seat of [[Electoral district of Gippsland West|Gippsland West]], this trend seemed set to continue.\n\nHowever, the verdict of many was that the 'Kennett Revolution' was far from over \u2013 indeed it was seemingly set in stone with the opening of the [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex|Crown Casino]] in May 1997. Kennett's profile continued to grow as he became a major commentator on national issues, including urging the new government of [[John Howard]] to introduce tax reform, and actively opposing the rise of the [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] Party of [[Pauline Hanson]]. In this last case, Kennett did not shy away from criticising the media, but also the decision of the Howard government to not actively oppose Hanson's agenda.<ref>George Megalogenis, ''The Longest Decade'', Carlton North: Scribe, 2006, pp.212\u2013213.</ref>\n\nKennett was influential in [[Melbourne]] bidding for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. Three cities initially expressed interest in hosting the event; Melbourne, [[Wellington]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Singapore]] dropped out before its bid was officially selected by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]], leaving only two candidate cities. In the weeks prior to the announcement of the 2006 host, [[Wellington]] withdrew its bid, citing the costs involved with matching the bid plan presented by Melbourne, which became the default host without members of the Federation going to vote.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Newsletter_volume2_No2.pdf Official Newsletter Volume 2, No 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216221409/http://commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Newsletter_volume2_No2.pdf |date=16 February 2011 }} May 1999, Commonwealth Games Australia</ref>\n\nThe government lost ground over the next few years, with high-profile disagreements with the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Bernard Bongiorno]], and [[Chief Audit Executive|Auditor-General]] [[Ches Baragwanath]] fuelling criticism of Kennett's governmental style. Kennett's perceived antipathy to Baragwanath led to 1997 legislation to restructure the office of the Auditor-General and set up Audit Victoria. While Kennett promised the independence of the office would be maintained, many saw his government's actions as an attempt to curb the Auditor-General's power to criticise government policy.<ref>John Waugh, 'The Kennett Government and the Constitution: No Change?', in Brian Costar & Nicholas Edonomou, ''The Kennett Revolution: Victorian Politics in the 1990s'', Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 1999, pp.59, 61.</ref> Widespread community debate and substantial public dissent from Liberal MPs and Party members ensued, with MLA Roger Pescott resigning from Parliament at the height of the debate; citing his disagreement with this Bill and Kennett's style in general.  The Liberal Party lost the by-election in Mitcham.\n\nFurther scandals involving the handling of contracts for the state emergency services response system damaged the credibility of Kennett in 1997\u20131998, while rural dissent continued to grow.\n\nPersonal difficulties also began to affect Kennett and his family. The strains of public life led to a trial separation between Felicity and Jeff in early 1998 (patched up by the end of the year), while earlier in Kennett's first term, public scrutiny had led to the forced sale of the KNF Advertising Company, despite all Kennett's involvement having been transferred to his wife's name. There were rumours in 1998 that Kennett might retire from politics; these were mostly centred around [[Phil Gude]], a longtime minister (as Industry and Employment Minister, 1992\u20131996, and Minister for Education, 1996\u20131999). These eventually came to nothing.\n\nIn July 1998, Liberal MP [[Peter McLellan]], Member for Frankston East, resigned from the party in protest over alleged corrupt Liberal Party [[Australian Senate|Senate]] preselection, changes to WorkCover and the auditor-general's office.  Again, Kennett failed to pick up the warning signs of declining support for his style of leadership.\n\nLabor leader [[John Brumby]] took care to capitalise on each of Kennett's mistakes over this period, though his absences in rural electorates were misunderstood by many Labor MPs, and led to his replacement by [[Steve Bracks]] in early 1999. Bracks, who came from [[Ballarat]], was popular in rural areas and was seen as a fresh alternative to Brumby, who nevertheless remained a key figure in the [[shadow Cabinet]].\n\n===1999 election loss===\nDespite Bracks' appeal, Kennett entered the [[1999 Victorian state election|1999 election]] campaign with a seemingly unassailable lead, and most commentators and opinion polls agreed that the Coalition would win a third term.\n\nHowever, in a shock result, the Coalition suffered a 13-seat swing to Labor.  While there was only a modest swing in eastern Melbourne, which has historically decided elections in Victoria, the Coalition suffered significant losses in regional centres such as [[Electoral district of Ballarat East|Ballarat]] and [[Electoral district of Bendigo East|Bendigo]].  ABC elections analyst [[Antony Green]] later said that when he first saw the results coming in, it looked so unusual that he thought \"something was wrong with the computer.\"<ref>Comment by [[Antony Green]] at pollbludger ([http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/?p=356#comments], 8 May 2006, accessed 2 February 2010.</ref>\n\nInitial counting showed Labor on 41 seats and the Coalition on 43; a supplementary election had to be held in [[Electoral district of Frankston East|Frankston East]] following the death of sitting independent [[Peter McLellan]].  The balance of power rested with three independents--[[Russell Savage]], [[Susan Davies]] and newly elected [[Craig Ingram]].  Negotiations began between the Coalition and the three independents. While Kennett acceded to all but two of their demands, his perceived poor treatment of Savage and Davies in the previous parliament meant that they would not even consider supporting a Coalition [[minority government]] headed by Kennett. On 18 October, two days after Labor won the supplementary election in Frankston East, the independents announced they would support a Labor minority government.  The agreement entailed Labor signing a Charter of Good Government, pledging to restore services to rural areas, and promising parliamentary reforms.\n\nKennett's supporters urged the Coalition to force a vote of 'no confidence' on the floor of the parliament in a last-ditch effort to force Savage, Davies and Ingram to support Kennett. However, with the Liberals divided on Kennett's future role, Kennett retired from all of his offices, saying he wished to have no further involvement in politics.  Labor won the ensuing by-election in Burwood.\n\n===Rumoured returns to politics===\nFollowing the Liberals' second defeat in [[2002 Victorian state election|2002 election]], rumours began that Kennett was planning a comeback to politics. The issue came to a head in May 2006 after the sudden resignation of Kennett's successor, [[Robert Doyle]], when Kennett announced he would contemplate standing in a by-election for Doyle's old seat of [[electoral district of Malvern|Malvern]] and offering himself as party leader. His stance was supported by Prime Minister [[John Howard]], who rated him as the party's best hope to win the [[2006 Victorian state election|November 2006 state election]]. But within 24 hours Kennett announced he would not return to Parliament rather than running against [[Ted Baillieu]], whom Kennett had been grooming for the top post since 1999.<ref>{{cite news | last=Harrison | first=Dan | title=Kennett calls it quits | date=5 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/kennett-calls-it-quits/2006/05/05/1146335899587.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Silkstone | first=Dan | title=Jeff admits: I asked Ted the wrong question | date=6 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/jeff-admits-i-asked-ted-the-wrong-question/2006/05/05/1146335926876.html | location=Melbourne}}</ref> John Howard was reported to have been \"embarrassed\" by having publicly supported Kennett before his decision not to re-enter politics.<ref>{{cite news | last=Austin and Tomazin | first=Paul and Farrah | title=Kennett backdown infuriates Howard | date=6 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/kennett-backdown-infuriates-pm/2006/05/05/1146335926867.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, it was rumoured that Kennett was planning to stand for Lord Mayor of Melbourne.

His Fifth and Sixth Forms were an improvement, but he was still described in school reports as \"[a] confident and at times helpful boy.  Sometimes irritates.  Sometimes works hard\" (1964), and \"[a] keen, pleasant, though sometimes erratic boy\" (1965).<ref>Tony Parkinson, ''Jeff: The Rise and Fall of a Political Phenomenon'', Ringwood: Penguin, 2000, p.19.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school, Kennett was persuaded by his father Ken to attend the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], but lost interest and left after one year of an economics degree. He returned to [[Melbourne]] and found work in the advertising department of the retail giant [[Myer]] \u2013 kindling an interest for advertising that would one day earn him his living.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jef'', pp.22\u201323.</ref>\n\nKennett's life in the regular workforce was cut short when, in 1968, he was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Australian Army]].<ref>Parkinson, ''Jef'', p.24.</ref>  Kennett was singled out as 'officer material' early in his career, and graduated third in his class from the [[Officer Training Unit, Scheyville]] (OTU) [[Scheyville, New South Wales|Scheyville]], near [[Windsor, New South Wales]], outside [[Sydney]]. He was posted to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] as Second Lieutenant, commander of 1st Platoon, A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR).<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', pp.25, 29.</ref> This military career (and his earlier experience in the Scotch College Cadet Corps) has been noted by many biographers as an essential formative influence on the adult Kennett's character. His sense and regard for hierarchical loyalty, punctuality, and general intolerance of dissent or disobedience may be traced to this period.<ref>Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', pp.365\u2013366.</ref>\n\nKennett returned to civilian life in 1970, reentering a divided Australian society, split by the [[Vietnam War]], of which Kennett was a firm supporter. Having returned to Myer, Kennett became impatient with his work, and so with Ian Fegan and Eran Nicols, he formed his own advertising company (KNF) in June 1971.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', p.36.</ref>\n\nThereafter, in December 1972, Kennett married Felicity Kellar, an old friend whom he had first met on a Number 69 tram on the long trips to school.<ref>Neales, S., \"Jeff's Friend Flicka\", ''The Good Weekend'', 2 November 1996, pp.30\u201333.</ref> Their first son, Ed, was born in 1974, followed by a daughter Amy, and two more sons, Angus and Ross.\n\n== Political career ==\nKennett was elected as a [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal]] Member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) for [[Electoral district of Burwood|Burwood]] in 1976, having had an interest in local politics since the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\">Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366.</ref> His [[preselection]] for the seat reportedly irritated then [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]] [[Rupert Hamer|Dick Hamer]], who disliked Kennett's campaigning style, and had endorsed the sitting member, [[Haddon Storey]].<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\"/> However by 1981, Kennett was promoted to Cabinet as Minister for Housing, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He was one of several younger MPs whom Hamer promoted to Cabinet in a bid to renew his government. Kennett retained his post when Hamer was replaced as Liberal leader and Premier by [[Lindsay Thompson]] in June of that year.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.366\"/> Following the defeat of the longstanding Liberal government in 1982, Kennett was the leading candidate to replace Thompson despite being the youngest member of the outgoing government. On 26 October, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party and hence Leader of the Opposition. He took an aggressive posture against the [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria)|Cain]] government, and was often criticised for his \"bull-in-a-china-shop\" style and his anti-government rhetoric.<ref>Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', pp.367 & Cartoon 10 between pp.146\u2013147.</ref>\n\nUnder his leadership, the Liberals were heavily defeated by Labor in [[1985 Victorian state election|1985]].  Afterwards he faced a challenge to his leadership of the party from [[Ian Smith (Australian politician)|Ian Smith]]. Kennett survived easily, but increasingly, he was seen as an erratic and unapproachable leader. He faced two more challenges to his leadership in 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368\"/> In 1987, in one notable incident Kennett referred to the Federal Liberal leader [[John Howard]] using colourful language in a mobile telephone conversation with Howard rival [[Andrew Peacock]].<ref>australianpolitics.com (1995\u20132006)</ref> The car-phone conversation damaged both Howard and Kennett politically, but aided Peacock in his push to return as Federal Liberal leader (1989).<ref>[http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/vic/87-03-23_car-phone.shtml Kennett-Peacock Car Phone Conversation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212172222/http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/vic/87-03-23_car-phone.shtml |date=12 December 2004 }}. Retrieved 5 May 2006.</ref>\n\nToward the end of its second term the Cain government had lost support and the Liberals were expected to win the [[1988 Victorian state election|1988 election]]. The Liberal vote indeed rebounded strongly \u2013 they won a majority of the two-party vote \u2013 however much of this margin was wasted on landslide majorities in their heartland. As a result, the Liberals took only one seat from Labor in the capital, and were left four seats short of a majority. Failing to become premier, Kennett was again criticised within his own party, and in 1989 he was deposed in favour of a little-known rural MLA, [[Alan Brown (Australian politician)|Alan Brown]].\n\nKennett's performance during his first stint as Liberal leader is a matter of debate. [[Nick Economou|Economou]] sees his 1985 and 1988 election campaigns as weak,<ref name=\"Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368\">Economou, 'Jeff Kennett', p.368.</ref> while Parkinson believes he was a significant asset in pushing the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] government of [[John Cain II|John Cain]] in several key seats. Kennett's reputation as a campaigner grew over time and by the mid 2000s was almost universally acknowledged to be perhaps a better campaigner than any of the many Liberal campaigners that had come before him. Many have described him as 'a complete campaigner'.<ref>Parkinson, ''Jeff'', pp.69\u201371.</ref>\n\n===First term as premier===\nKennett publicly pledged never to attempt a return to the Liberal leadership. However, when Brown proved unable to challenge the government effectively, he allowed his supporters to call a spill in 1991. Brown realised he didn't have enough support to keep his post and resigned, allowing Kennett to retake the leadership unopposed.\n\nWith Victoria reeling under billions of dollars of debt, Kennett was seen as \"Premier-in-waiting\" from the moment he retook the leadership. Cain had resigned a year earlier in favour of Deputy Premier [[Joan Kirner]], who was unable to regain the upper hand despite being personally more popular than Kennett. The Liberals' advantage was strengthened by an important decision taken during Brown's brief tenure as leader\u2014negotiating a [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] agreement with the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 Victoria|National Party]]. The Liberals and Nationals have historically had a strained relationship in Victoria; they had sat separately for most of the second half of the 20th century. Indeed, it had been believed that Kennett had been denied victory in 1988 due to a large number of three-cornered contests in rural seats.\n\nThe Coalition went into the [[1992 Victorian state election|October 1992 state election]] as unbeatable favourites, having been ahead in opinion polling by large margins for almost two years. They stoked the voters' anger with a series of \"Guilty Party\" ads, targeting many Labor ministers and highlighting concerns in their portfolios. In the second-largest defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria, the Coalition scored a 19-seat swing, attaining a 16-seat majority in the Legislative Assembly. The Liberals won 52 seats, enough for a majority in their own right. Although Kennett could have governed alone, he supported his coalition partner, retaining the Nationals in his cabinet.\n\n====Privatisation====\nIn office, Kennett immediately instituted a budget-cutting and privatisation program in an effort to improve the State's economy. Having assumed office, the need for such action was justified by Kennett and his new [[Treasurer of Victoria|Treasurer]], [[Alan Stockdale]] who discovered that the outgoing government had left them with $2.2 billion budget deficit, a net public sector debt of $33 billion and budget sector debt of $16 billion. To bring down the deficit and control debt, public sector would be reduced, with some 50,000 public servants being retrenched between 1992 and 1995. Critic, former Mayor of [[Brighton, Victoria]] John Locco stated in 2005 \"Kennett decided in his socially demented way that everything had to be privatised.\" <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/icebergers-taking-the-heat-of-competition/2005/12/10/1134086848680.html | title=Icebergers taking the heat of competition| date=11 December 2005}}</ref>\n\n====State school closures====\nIn the first three years of office, funding for public schools and the Department of Education was substantially reduced. 350 government schools were closed, and 7,000 teaching jobs eliminated.<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/000000771.htm Article Title ; STRUGGLE FOR A NEW PUBLIC DEMOCRACY School, Community and the State], by Tony Knight. Northland Secondary College era 1992 \u2013 1996.</ref>\n\n====Public transport====\nOther controversial moves included the sacking of 16,000 public transport workers in a major technological upgrade of the system, and the initiation of a major scheme for privatisation of state-owned services, including the electricity ([[State Electricity Commission of Victoria|SECV]]) and gas ([[Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria]]) utilities, the ambulance service, as well as several prisons and other minor services.  The sale of the [[Totalisator Agency Board]] raised $609 million. Between 1995 and 1998, $29 billion of state assets in gas and electricity alone were sold to private enterprise (for statistics, see Parkinson, ''Jeff'', 1999).<ref>http://www.dtf.vic.au/CA25713E0002EF43/WebObj/BP4Final/$File/BPFinal.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nIn the wake of these changes, investment and population growth slowly resumed, though [[unemployment]] was to remain above the national average for the duration of Kennett's premiership. While the benefits to the State budget figures were indisputable in the short term, the social and longer-term economic cost of the Kennett reforms have been questioned by many commentators, academics and those who suffered economically through the period of reform.<ref name=\"crikey.com.au\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2012/07/03/carbon-price-v-privatisation-which-is-worse-in-the-latrobe/|title=Carbon price v privatisation \u2013 which is worse in the Latrobe?|date=3 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"newsweekly.com.au\">{{Cite web | url=http://newsweekly.com.au/article.php?id=4292 |title = ECONOMIC AFFAIRS: Privatisation has failed to deliver cheaper electricity}}</ref><ref name=\"theage.com.au\">{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/1-billion-nightmare-20110121-1a026.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title= Billion Nightmare}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/on-track-for-more-of-the-same-20090627-d0ho.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=On track for more of the same}}</ref>  This campaign of privatisations and cutbacks led to governmental acts of privatisation or budget-cutting becoming popularly known as being \"Jeffed\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/1997/week06/1825.htm |title = Hansard of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/1997/week11/3569.htm |title = Hansard of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT}}</ref>\n\nThe largest public [[protest]] in Melbourne since the [[Vietnam War]] Moratorium occurred on 10 November 1992, with an estimated 100,000 people marching in opposition to the retrenchment of many workers and the large State budget cutbacks. Kennett was undeterred by this protest, and famously commented that though there were 100,000 outside his office at Parliament that day, there were 4.5 million who stayed at home or at work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maynereport.com/articles/2010/12/13-2218-674.html|title=The Mayne Report \u2013 The first days of Jeff Kennett|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/former-labor-leader-steve-bracks-says-the-jeff-kennett-era-was-a-dangerous-time/story-fndo4cq1-1226488529180 | work=Herald Sun | title=Former Labor leader Steve Bracks says the Jeff Kennett era was a dangerous time | date=5 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was difficult to assess the merits or otherwise of Kennett's 'Revolution' in his first term at the time.  However, as time has passed, Kennett's policies have been widely criticised and used by ideological opponents as examples of poor governmental decision making.<ref name=\"crikey.com.au\"/><ref name=\"newsweekly.com.au\"/><ref name=\"theage.com.au\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====High-profile capital works projects====\nThe Kennett government also embarked on a series of high-profile capital works projects, such as the restoration of [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]] (never completed), construction of a new $250 million [[Melbourne Museum]] (Which was widely opposed by the Victorian Community at the time) and IMAX theatre, and a new $130 million [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]] (still known colloquially as 'Jeff's Shed'). Other projects, made possible in monetary terms by the early cutbacks and budget restructuring, included a $160 million expansion of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]; $100 million for refurbishment of the State Library of Victoria; $65 million for a new [[Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre]] (MSAC); and $130 million for the construction of a new civic square on the site of the old [[Gas and Fuel Buildings]], to be known as [[Federation Square]].\n\nThe relocation of the [[Australian Grand Prix|Formula 1 Grand Prix]] from [[Adelaide]] in 1993 was a particular coup for Kennett, who had worked hard with his friend [[Ron Walker (Australian businessman)|Ron Walker]], the Chairman of the Melbourne Major Events Company, helped deliver Melbourne the hosting rights for the event from Adelaide in 1993.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/grand-prix-got-victoria-on-the-move-again-kennett-20100319-qm8q.html Grand prix got Victoria on the move again: Kennett], By Jason Dowling, 20 March 2010, The Age</ref>\n\nThe most controversial project of the Kennett era was the $1.85 billion [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex]], a gambling and entertainment centre on Melbourne's [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]]. Initial plans for a casino had been made under the Labor government, however the tendering process and construction occurred under Kennett. Allegations of financial inconsistencies in the tendering process (which eventually saw longtime Kennett supporters Ron Walker and [[Lloyd J. Williams|Lloyd Williams]] successful) were to dog the Kennett government for many years, despite the verdict of an enquiry which found no wrongdoing on its behalf.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nA $2 billion project to redevelop Melbourne's derelict [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] area to include a [[Docklands Stadium|new football stadium]] was also undertaken, in addition to the large [[CityLink]] project, a project resurrected from the [[1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan]], aimed at linking Melbourne's freeways, easing traffic problems in the inner city, and reducing commuting times from the outer suburbs to the CBD.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Second term as premier===\nKennett's personal popularity was mostly average to high through his first term, though that of the government as a whole went through peaks and troughs. Without a [[by-election]] in the previous four years, the [[1996 Victorian state election|1996 state election]] shaped up as the first test of the 'Kennett Revolution' with the electorate. The Coalition was expected to win a second term at the 30 March election, albeit with a somewhat reduced majority.  At the [[1996 Australian federal election|federal election]] held four weeks earlier, while Labor was heavily defeated, it actually picked up a swing in Victoria.\n\nHowever, to the surprise of most commentators, the Coalition only suffered a two-seat swing, allowing it to retain a comfortable 14-seat majority. The Coalition actually picked up modest swings in Melbourne's outer suburbs, which have traditionally decided most state elections. Several negative trends (for the Liberals) were obscured somewhat by the euphoria of victory. The government's sharp cuts to government services were particularly resented in country Victoria, where the Liberals and Nationals held almost all the seats. The loss of the [[Electoral district of Mildura|Mildura]] seat to independent [[Russell Savage]] was an indication of this disaffection, and when in February 1997 independent [[Susan Davies]] was elected to the seat of [[Electoral district of Gippsland West|Gippsland West]], this trend seemed set to continue.\n\nHowever, the verdict of many was that the 'Kennett Revolution' was far from over \u2013 indeed it was seemingly set in stone with the opening of the [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex|Crown Casino]] in May 1997. Kennett's profile continued to grow as he became a major commentator on national issues, including urging the new government of [[John Howard]] to introduce tax reform, and actively opposing the rise of the [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] Party of [[Pauline Hanson]]. In this last case, Kennett did not shy away from criticising the media, but also the decision of the Howard government to not actively oppose Hanson's agenda.<ref>George Megalogenis, ''The Longest Decade'', Carlton North: Scribe, 2006, pp.212\u2013213.</ref>\n\nKennett was influential in [[Melbourne]] bidding for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. Three cities initially expressed interest in hosting the event; Melbourne, [[Wellington]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Singapore]] dropped out before its bid was officially selected by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]], leaving only two candidate cities. In the weeks prior to the announcement of the 2006 host, [[Wellington]] withdrew its bid, citing the costs involved with matching the bid plan presented by Melbourne, which became the default host without members of the Federation going to vote.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Newsletter_volume2_No2.pdf Official Newsletter Volume 2, No 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216221409/http://commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Newsletter_volume2_No2.pdf |date=16 February 2011 }} May 1999, Commonwealth Games Australia</ref>\n\nThe government lost ground over the next few years, with high-profile disagreements with the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Bernard Bongiorno]], and [[Chief Audit Executive|Auditor-General]] [[Ches Baragwanath]] fuelling criticism of Kennett's governmental style. Kennett's perceived antipathy to Baragwanath led to 1997 legislation to restructure the office of the Auditor-General and set up Audit Victoria. While Kennett promised the independence of the office would be maintained, many saw his government's actions as an attempt to curb the Auditor-General's power to criticise government policy.<ref>John Waugh, 'The Kennett Government and the Constitution: No Change?', in Brian Costar & Nicholas Edonomou, ''The Kennett Revolution: Victorian Politics in the 1990s'', Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 1999, pp.59, 61.</ref> Widespread community debate and substantial public dissent from Liberal MPs and Party members ensued, with MLA Roger Pescott resigning from Parliament at the height of the debate; citing his disagreement with this Bill and Kennett's style in general.  The Liberal Party lost the by-election in Mitcham.\n\nFurther scandals involving the handling of contracts for the state emergency services response system damaged the credibility of Kennett in 1997\u20131998, while rural dissent continued to grow.\n\nPersonal difficulties also began to affect Kennett and his family. The strains of public life led to a trial separation between Felicity and Jeff in early 1998 (patched up by the end of the year), while earlier in Kennett's first term, public scrutiny had led to the forced sale of the KNF Advertising Company, despite all Kennett's involvement having been transferred to his wife's name. There were rumours in 1998 that Kennett might retire from politics; these were mostly centred around [[Phil Gude]], a longtime minister (as Industry and Employment Minister, 1992\u20131996, and Minister for Education, 1996\u20131999). These eventually came to nothing.\n\nIn July 1998, Liberal MP [[Peter McLellan]], Member for Frankston East, resigned from the party in protest over alleged corrupt Liberal Party [[Australian Senate|Senate]] preselection, changes to WorkCover and the auditor-general's office.  Again, Kennett failed to pick up the warning signs of declining support for his style of leadership.\n\nLabor leader [[John Brumby]] took care to capitalise on each of Kennett's mistakes over this period, though his absences in rural electorates were misunderstood by many Labor MPs, and led to his replacement by [[Steve Bracks]] in early 1999. Bracks, who came from [[Ballarat]], was popular in rural areas and was seen as a fresh alternative to Brumby, who nevertheless remained a key figure in the [[shadow Cabinet]].\n\n===1999 election loss===\nDespite Bracks' appeal, Kennett entered the [[1999 Victorian state election|1999 election]] campaign with a seemingly unassailable lead, and most commentators and opinion polls agreed that the Coalition would win a third term.\n\nHowever, in a shock result, the Coalition suffered a 13-seat swing to Labor.  While there was only a modest swing in eastern Melbourne, which has historically decided elections in Victoria, the Coalition suffered significant losses in regional centres such as [[Electoral district of Ballarat East|Ballarat]] and [[Electoral district of Bendigo East|Bendigo]].  ABC elections analyst [[Antony Green]] later said that when he first saw the results coming in, it looked so unusual that he thought \"something was wrong with the computer.\"<ref>Comment by [[Antony Green]] at pollbludger ([http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/?p=356#comments], 8 May 2006, accessed 2 February 2010.</ref>\n\nInitial counting showed Labor on 41 seats and the Coalition on 43; a supplementary election had to be held in [[Electoral district of Frankston East|Frankston East]] following the death of sitting independent [[Peter McLellan]].  The balance of power rested with three independents--[[Russell Savage]], [[Susan Davies]] and newly elected [[Craig Ingram]].  Negotiations began between the Coalition and the three independents. While Kennett acceded to all but two of their demands, his perceived poor treatment of Savage and Davies in the previous parliament meant that they would not even consider supporting a Coalition [[minority government]] headed by Kennett. On 18 October, two days after Labor won the supplementary election in Frankston East, the independents announced they would support a Labor minority government.  The agreement entailed Labor signing a Charter of Good Government, pledging to restore services to rural areas, and promising parliamentary reforms.\n\nKennett's supporters urged the Coalition to force a vote of 'no confidence' on the floor of the parliament in a last-ditch effort to force Savage, Davies and Ingram to support Kennett. However, with the Liberals divided on Kennett's future role, Kennett retired from all of his offices, saying he wished to have no further involvement in politics.  Labor won the ensuing by-election in Burwood.\n\n===Rumoured returns to politics===\nFollowing the Liberals' second defeat in [[2002 Victorian state election|2002 election]], rumours began that Kennett was planning a comeback to politics. The issue came to a head in May 2006 after the sudden resignation of Kennett's successor, [[Robert Doyle]], when Kennett announced he would contemplate standing in a by-election for Doyle's old seat of [[electoral district of Malvern|Malvern]] and offering himself as party leader. His stance was supported by Prime Minister [[John Howard]], who rated him as the party's best hope to win the [[2006 Victorian state election|November 2006 state election]]. But within 24 hours Kennett announced he would not return to Parliament rather than running against [[Ted Baillieu]], whom Kennett had been grooming for the top post since 1999.<ref>{{cite news | last=Harrison | first=Dan | title=Kennett calls it quits | date=5 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/kennett-calls-it-quits/2006/05/05/1146335899587.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Silkstone | first=Dan | title=Jeff admits: I asked Ted the wrong question | date=6 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/jeff-admits-i-asked-ted-the-wrong-question/2006/05/05/1146335926876.html | location=Melbourne}}</ref> John Howard was reported to have been \"embarrassed\" by having publicly supported Kennett before his decision not to re-enter politics.<ref>{{cite news | last=Austin and Tomazin | first=Paul and Farrah | title=Kennett backdown infuriates Howard | date=6 May 2006 | newspaper=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/kennett-backdown-infuriates-pm/2006/05/05/1146335926867.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, it was rumoured that Kennett was planning to stand for Lord Mayor of Melbourne.

The energy industry generates about a quarter of Canada's export revenues and employs some 650,000 people across the country.<ref name=\"Energy Policy Institute of Canada\"/>\n\n==== Geographic considerations ====\nCanada's geography, with its vast distances between many communities combined with the length and coldness of Canadian winters, contributes to Canada's high hydrocarbon consumption. As temperatures drop, fuel consumption rises and fuel efficiency drops. However, this has been largely taken into account by the structure of the Kyoto Protocol, which assigns targets depending on the given country's own emissions in 1990. Since in 1990 Canada was already vast and even colder than today, its emissions were already much higher, and, consequently, Canada's 2012 Kyoto target much more forgiving, than the targets of other countries with comparable population sizes. In fact, the 1990 emission benchmark not only implicitly accounts for objective factors, like climate and distances, but also rewards wasteful lifestyle choices\u2014the preference to live in low-density suburbs and in large, energy-inefficient, individual homes did inflate Canada's 1990 emissions, and, therefore, further increased Canada's allowable emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nOf the 162&nbsp;Mt of emissions resulting from transportation sources in 2008, over half, or about 12 percent, of Canada's total emissions can be attributed to passenger cars and light trucks. Emissions from these areas made up approximately 55 percent of Canada's total transportation emissions in 2008: light trucks (29.2%), heavy-duty trucks (27%), cars (25.4%), domestic aviation (5.3%), rail (4.4%), domestic marine (3.6%), other (5.2%).

The energy industry generates about a quarter of Canada's export revenues and employs some 650,000 people across the country.<ref name=\"Energy Policy Institute of Canada\"/>\n\n==== Geographic considerations ====\nCanada's geography, with its vast distances between many communities combined with the length and coldness of Canadian winters, contributes to Canada's high hydrocarbon consumption. As temperatures drop, fuel consumption rises and fuel efficiency drops. However, this has been largely taken into account by the structure of the Kyoto Protocol, which assigns targets depending on the given country's own emissions in 1990. Since in 1990 Canada was already vast and even colder than today, its emissions were already much higher, and, consequently, Canada's 2012 Kyoto target much more forgiving, than the targets of other countries with comparable population sizes. In fact, the 1990 emission benchmark not only implicitly accounts for objective factors, like climate and distances, but also rewards wasteful lifestyle choices\u2014the preference to live in low-density suburbs and in large, energy-inefficient, individual homes did inflate Canada's 1990 emissions, and, therefore, further increased Canada's allowable emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nOf the 162&nbsp;Mt of emissions resulting from transportation sources in 2008, over half, or about 12 percent, of Canada's total emissions can be attributed to passenger cars and light trucks. Emissions from these areas made up approximately 55 percent of Canada's total transportation emissions in 2008: light trucks (29.2%), heavy-duty trucks (27%), cars (25.4%), domestic aviation (5.3%), rail (4.4%), domestic marine (3.6%), other (5.2%).

The four games, ''.hack//Infection'', ''.hack//Mutation'', ''.hack//Outbreak'', and ''.hack//Quarantine'', all feature a \"[[story within a story|game within a game]]\", a fictional [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) called ''The World'' which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra [[DVD]] containing an episode of ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'', the accompanying [[original video animation]] (OVA) series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a [[multimedia]] [[Multimedia franchise|franchise]] called ''[[.hack#Project .hack|Project .hack]]'', which explores the mysterious origins of ''The World''. Set after the events of the anime series, ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', the games focus on a player character named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become [[coma]]tose in the real world as a result of playing ''The World''. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of the game and its effects on the stability of the [[Internet]].\n\nCritics gave the series mixed reviews. It was praised for its unique setting and its commitment to preserve the [[suspension of disbelief]], as well as the [[Character creation|character designs]]. However, it was criticized for uneven [[Pacing (narrative)|pacing]] and a lack of improvement between games in the series. The commercial success of the franchise led to the production of ''[[#.hack//fr\u00e4gment|.hack//fr\u00e4gment]]''\u2014a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the series with [[Online game|online capabilities]], solely for the Japanese PS2\u2014and ''[[.hack//G.U.]]'', another video game trilogy, which started its release in 2006 for the PS2 and concluded in 2017 with a remastered trilogy for the PS4 and Windows titled ''.hack//G.U.

Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons, and \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat.

The four games, ''.hack//Infection'', ''.hack//Mutation'', ''.hack//Outbreak'', and ''.hack//Quarantine'', all feature a \"[[story within a story|game within a game]]\", a fictional [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) called ''The World'' which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra [[DVD]] containing an episode of ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'', the accompanying [[original video animation]] (OVA) series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a [[multimedia]] [[Multimedia franchise|franchise]] called ''[[.hack#Project .hack|Project .hack]]'', which explores the mysterious origins of ''The World''. Set after the events of the anime series, ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', the games focus on a player character named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become [[coma]]tose in the real world as a result of playing ''The World''. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of the game and its effects on the stability of the [[Internet]].\n\nCritics gave the series mixed reviews. It was praised for its unique setting and its commitment to preserve the [[suspension of disbelief]], as well as the [[Character creation|character designs]]. However, it was criticized for uneven [[Pacing (narrative)|pacing]] and a lack of improvement between games in the series.

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">Flip Animation blog entry \"Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions\" http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">The Disney Project blog article \"The Making of Cranium Command\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref name=\"David\">Remain Seated Please blog entry \"Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!\" http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=rogpalmeruk>Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/</ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition.

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">Flip Animation blog entry \"Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions\" http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">The Disney Project blog article \"The Making of Cranium Command\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html</ref> Rees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\nWhile work on the animation commenced the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref name=\"David\">Remain Seated Please blog entry \"Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!\" http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=rogpalmeruk>Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/</ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition. A number of animatronic elements including Buzzy were marked by the Walt Disney archives for preservation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sonswa |first1=Matt |title=Disney Cranium Command Epcot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrOPmotqGCY&t |website=YouTube |publisher=MattSonswa |accessdate= 3 February 2019}}</ref> Cranium Command subsequently became an increasingly popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Wonders of Life pavilion, including the Cranium Command show building, will be repurposed as a new pavilion entitled [[Play!]]. What will happen to the show itself is currently unknown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/02/first-of-its-kind-play-pavilion-new-park-entrance-part-of-epcots-historic-transformation/|title=First-of-its-Kind Play Pavilion, New Park Entrance Part of Epcot's Historic Transformation|website=Disney Parks Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===Reported theft===\nIn December 2018 it was reported that the Buzzy animatronic had been stolen.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abell |first1=Bailee |title=UPDATED: Disney fans take to social media after animatronic is stolen from Epcot |url=https://insidethemagic.net/2018/12/ba1-epcot-buzzy-animatronic-stolen/ |website=Inside the Magic |accessdate=3 February 2019|date=December 23, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Retired robot's clothing stolen from Walt Disney World |url=https://www.apnews.com/6454e012658d4421a64ddbcf6ea37b02 |website=Associated Press |accessdate=3 February 2019|date=December 27, 2018 }}</ref> The theft generated a considerable amount of reactions and speculation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Josh |title=5 Reasons Why The Buzzy Animatronic Story Is Totally Bizarre |url=https://themeparkuniversity.com/disney/5-reasons-why-the-buzzy-animatronic-story-is-totally-bizarre/ |website=Theme Park University |accessdate=3 February 2019|date=December 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Who Stole Buzzy: Disney's Missing Animatronic |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WvNiRrx7YQ&t |website=YouTube |publisher=Offhand Disney |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, Disney urban explorer Dave Ensign claimed on the Cinemoddities podcast that he had contacted Disney insiders and discovered that Buzzy had never been stolen although his hat and coat were. Allegedly, urban explorers were frequently taking selfies with Buzzy who was mounted dangerously high above a mechanical pit in the stage. Ensign explained that facility operations had \"stolen\" the figure: \"They had an order to remove him so people wouldn't hurt themselves by sneaking in there and climbing on the sets. Unfortunately, nobody told operations or security who found it missing and assumed he'd been stolen.\" Disney made no official comment on the matter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kubersky |first1=Seth |title=The shadowy world of Orlando's theme park urban explorers: Are they legends or are they idiots? |url=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/the-shadowy-world-of-orlandos-theme-park-urban-explorers-are-they-legends-or-are-they-idiots/Content?oid=23422045 |website=Orlando Weekly |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Buzzy FOUND - Cranium Command |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lSXzWCIIXs |website=YouTube |publisher=RogueKnite |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the Buzzy animatronic was still missing from the closed attraction.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=David |date=17 May 2019 |title=Former employee arrested for stealing $14K in Disney costumes from Magic Kingdom, Epcot, deputies say |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/crime/os-ne-patrick-spikes-arrested-disney-buzzy-20190518-jylgndquszh2nmgzv736tc43si-story.html |work=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=11 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, two men, former Disney employee Patrick Spikes and his cousin Blaytin Taunton, were arrested in connection to the theft of the Buzzy animatronic character's belongings and selling them on the black market.<ref>{{cite news|date=2019-09-18|title=Ex-Disney employee accused of stealing costumes to sell on black market|url=https://www.wesh.com/article/ex-disney-employee-accused-of-stealing-costumes-to-sell-on-black-market/29090797|work=WESH|access-date=2019-09-18|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In February 2020, after both men made a plea deal of [[no contest]] regarding the theft and sale of the belongings and those of [[The Haunted Mansion|Haunted Mansion]] props, Spikes was sentenced to ten years probation and 250 hours of community service, while Taunton was sentenced to five years probation and 125 hours of community service.<ref name=\"WESH plea\">{{cite news|date=2020-02-05|title=Man says 'I'm going to Disney' after avoiding jail time in Magic Kingdom [''sic''] theft case|url=https://www.wesh.com/article/patrick-spikes-disney-magic-kingdom-theft-case-plea-deal/30767212|work=WESH|access-date=2020-04-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both men were also ordered to pay over $25,000 in [[restitution]] and are no longer permitted to set foot on Disney property.<ref name=\"WESH plea\"/>\n\n==Attraction facts==\n* '''Grand opening:''' October 19, 1989\n* '''Pre-show length:''' 5:00\n* '''Show length:''' 17:00\n* '''New show every:''' 18:00\n* '''Ride system:''' [[Audio-Animatronic]] theater presentation\n\n==See also==\n* [[Epcot]]\n* [[Wonders of Life]]\n* [[List of Epcot attractions]]\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' (2015), a Disney-Pixar film characterizing the emotions inside a girl.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0201546}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061213113720/http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/parks/attractionDetail?id=CraniumCommandAttractionPage Walt Disney World Resort - Cranium Command]\n\n{{Epcot}}\n\n[[Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2007]]\n[[Category:Former Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts films]]\n[[Category:Audio-Animatronic attractions]]\n[[Category:Future World (Epcot)]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:2007 disestablishments in Florida]]\n", "name_user": "JeffreyLoeber", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProduction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranium_Command"}
