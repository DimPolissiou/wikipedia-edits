He served as [[Regent]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] [[Hungary between the two world wars|between World Wars I and II]] and throughout most of [[World War II]], from 1 March 1920 to 15 October 1944.

He saw action in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] and became Commander-in-Chief of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] Navy in the last year of the [[First World War]]; he was promoted to [[Vice-Admiral]] and Commander of the Fleet when the previous Admiral was dismissed from his post by [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Karl]] following mutinies. In 1919, following [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918\u201320)|a series of revolutions and external interventions in Hungary]] from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Horthy returned to Budapest with the National Army and was subsequently invited to become Regent of the Kingdom by parliament.\n\nHorthy led a [[national conservatism|national conservative]]<ref>John Laughland: ''A History of Political Trials: From Charles I to Saddam Hussein'', Peter Lang Ltd, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1sRMIZGX9UMC&pg=PA143&dq=%22National+conservative%22+Horthy&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22National%20conservative%22%20Horthy&f=false]</ref>\ngovernment through the [[interwar period]], banning the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] as well as the [[Arrow Cross Party]], and pursuing an [[irredentism|irredentist]] foreign policy in the face of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. [[Charles IV of Hungary|King Charles IV]] unsuccessfully attempted twice to return to Hungary until, in 1921, the Hungarian Government caved in to Allied threats to renew hostilities. King Charles was escorted out of Hungary on a British warship into exile.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Horthy's foreign policy led him into a reluctant alliance with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. With the begrudging support of [[Adolf Hitler]], Horthy was able to recover certain Hungarian lands removed from them by the Allies. Under Horthy's leadership, Hungary gave support to [[Poles|Polish]] refugees in 1939 and participated in a supportive (as opposed to front-line) role in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941]], and during the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] the same year occupied and annexed former Hungarian territories which had been given to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929 [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) by the Allies after the First World War. Horthy's reluctance to contribute to the German war effort and the [[Holocaust in Hungary]], as well as refusing to hand over more than 600,000 of the 825,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] to German authorities, coupled with several attempts to strike a secret deal with the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies of World War II]] after it had become obvious that Axis would lose the war, eventually led the Germans to invade and take control of the country in March 1944 in [[Operation Margarethe]]. In October 1944, Horthy announced that Hungary had declared an armistice with the Allies and withdrawn from the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. He was forced to resign, placed under arrest by the Germans and taken to [[Bavaria]].

In 1915, he earned a reputation for boldness while commanding the new light cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}}. He planned the 1917 attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]], which resulted in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]], the largest naval engagement of the war in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. A consolidated British, French and Italian fleet met the Austro-Hungarian force. Despite the numerical superiority of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] fleet, the Austrian force emerged from the battle victorious. The Austrian fleet remained relatively unscathed, however Horthy was wounded. After the [[Cattaro mutiny]] of February 1918, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] (Charles IV as King of Hungary) selected Horthy over many more senior commanders as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Fleet in March 1918. In June, Horthy planned another attack on Otranto, and in a departure from the cautious strategy of his predecessors, he committed the empire's battleships to the mission. While sailing through the night, the dreadnought {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} met Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]] and was sunk, causing Horthy to abort the mission. He managed to preserve the rest of the empire's [[fleet in being]] until he was ordered by Emperor Charles to surrender it to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (the predecessor of Yugoslavia) on 31 October.<ref name=\"TuckerWood1996\"/>\n\nThe end of the war saw Hungary turned into a landlocked nation, and with that, the new government had little need for Horthy's services. He retired with his family to his private estate at [[Kenderes]], but his role as a Hungarian leader was far from over.\n\n===Dates of rank and assignments===\n[[File:Novaral.jpg|thumb|The damaged [[SMS Novara (1913)|SMS ''Novara'']] after the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of Otranto]]]]\n[[File:Hswoon.png|thumb|Horthy, seriously wounded, commanded the fleet at the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|battle of Otranto Strait]] until falling unconscious]]\n\n* 1896 ''[[Fregattenleutnant]]'' (Frigate Lieutenant) (''fregatthadnagy'' \u2013 Sub-Lieutenant)\n* 1900 ''Linienschiffleutnant'' (Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant) (''sorhaj\u00f3hadnagy'' \u2013 Lieutenant)\n* January 1901 SMS Sperber (commander of the vessel)\n* 1902 SMS ''Kranich'' (commander of the vessel)\n* June 1908 SMS ''Taurus'' (commander of the vessel)\n* August 1908 {{SMS|Kaiser Karl VI}} (GDO-Gesamtdetailoffizier-First Officer, temporary)\n* 1 January 1909 ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Corvette Captain) (''korvettkapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Lieutenant-Commander]])\n* 1 November 1909 aide-de-camp to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef]]\n* 1 November 1911 ''[[Fregattenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Frigate Captain) (''fregattkapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Commander]])\n* December 1912 March 1913 {{SMS|Budapest}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 20 January 1914 ''[[Linienschiffskapit\u00e4n]]'' (Ship-of-the-Line Captain) (''sorhaj\u00f3kapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Captain (naval)|Captain]])\n* August 1914 {{SMS|Habsburg}} (commander of the vessel)\n* December 1914 {{SMS|Novara|1912|6}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 1 February 1918 {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 27 February 1918 ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (''ellentengernagy'' \u2013 [[Rear Admiral]])\n* 27 February 1918 appointed (last) Commander in Chief of the fleet (over 11 admirals and 24 senior ''Linienschiffskapit\u00e4n'') by [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Karl I]]\n* 30 October 1918 ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (''altengernagy'' \u2013 [[Vice Admiral]])\n\n==Interwar period, 1919\u20131939==\n===Commander of the National Army===\n[[File:Horthy enters Budapest.webm|thumb|350px|Horthy enters Budapest, 16 November 1919 (1080p film footage)]]\nTwo national traumas that followed the First World War profoundly shaped the spirit and future of the Hungarian nation. The first was the loss, as dictated by the [[Allies of World War I]], of large portions of Hungarian territory that had bordered other countries. These were lands that had belonged to Hungary (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) but were now ceded mainly to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The excisions, eventually ratified in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, cost Hungary two-thirds of its territory and one-third of its native Hungarian speakers; this dealt the population a terrible psychological blow. The second trauma began in March 1919, when the Communist leader [[B\u00e9la Kun]] seized power in the capital, [[Budapest]], after the first proto-democratic government in Hungary faltered.<ref>L\u00e1z\u00e1r, Istv\u00e1n, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Budapest: Corvina, 1993 (English edition) Translated by Albert Tezla; Chapter 13</ref>\n\nKun and his colleagues proclaimed a [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and promised the restoration of Hungary's former grandeur. Instead, his efforts at reconquest failed, and Hungarians were treated to a Soviet-style repression in the form of [[Lenin Boys|armed gangs]] who intimidated or murdered enemies of the regime. This period of violence came to be known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]].<ref>Deak, Istvan, \"A Hungarian Admiral on Horseback\", from ''Essays on Hitler's Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2001, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nWithin weeks of his coup, Kun's popularity plummeted. On 30 May 1919, anti-Communist politicians formed a counter-revolutionary government in the southern city of [[Szeged]], which was occupied by French forces at the time. There, [[Gyula K\u00e1rolyi]], the prime minister of the counter-revolutionary government, asked former admiral Horthy, still considered a war hero, to be the Minister of War in the new government and take command of a counter-revolutionary force that would be named the National Army ({{lang-hu|Nemzeti Hadsereg}}). Horthy consented, and he arrived in Szeged on 6 June. Soon afterwards, because of orders from the Allied powers, a cabinet was reformed, and Horthy was not given a seat in it. Undaunted, Horthy managed to retain control of the National Army by detaching the army command from the War Ministry.\n\nAfter the Communist government collapsed and its leaders fled, French-supported Romanian forces entered Budapest on 6 August 1919. In retaliation for the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]], reactionary crews now exacted revenge in a two-year wave of violent repression known today as the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]]. These reprisals were organized and carried out by officers of Horthy's National Army, particularly [[P\u00e1l Pr\u00f3nay]],<ref name=\"Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469\">Patai, Raphael, ''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 468\u2013469</ref> Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Iv\u00e1n H\u00e9jjas.<ref name=\"Bodo\">Bod\u00f3, B\u00e9la: ''Paramilitary Violence in Hungary After the First World War'', East European Quarterly, No. 2, Vol. 38, 22 June 2004</ref> Their victims were primarily [[Communist]]s, [[Social Democrats]], and Jews. Most Hungarian Jews were not supporters of the Bolsheviks, but much of the leadership of the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been young Jewish intellectuals, and anger about the Communist revolution easily translated into anti-Semitic hostility.<ref name=\"Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469\"/>\n\nIn Budapest, Pr\u00f3nay installed his unit in the Hotel Britannia, where the group swelled to [[battalion]] size. Their program of vicious attacks continued; they planned a citywide [[pogrom]] against the Jews until Horthy found out and put a stop to it. In his diary, Pr\u00f3nay reported that Horthy:<blockquote>reproached me for the many Jewish corpses found in the various parts of the country, especially in the Transdanubia. This, he emphasized, gave the foreign press extra ammunitions against us. He told me that we should stop harassing small Jews; instead, we should kill some big (Kun government) Jews such as Somogyi or V\u00e1zsonyi \u2013 these people deserve punishment much more... in vain, I tried to convince him that the liberal papers would be against us anyway, and it did not matter that we killed only one Jew or we killed them all<ref>Szabo and Pamlenyi: ''A hatarban a halal kaszal'', pp.160 and 131</ref></blockquote>The degree of Horthy's responsibility for the excesses of Pr\u00f3nay is disputed. On several occasions, Horthy reached out to stop Pr\u00f3nay from a particularly excessive burst of anti-Jewish cruelty, and the Jews of Pest went on record absolving Horthy of the White Terror as early as the fall of 1919, when they released a statement disavowing the Kun revolution and blaming the terror on a few units within the National Army. Horthy has never been found to have personally engaged in White Terror atrocities.  But his American biographer [[Thomas L. Sakmyster]] concluded that he \"tacitly supported the right wing officer detachments\" who carried out the terror;<ref>{{cite book | last = Sakmyster | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = Thomas L. Sakmyster | title = Hungary's Admiral on Horseback: Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, 1918\u20131944 | publisher = Columbia University Press = date = 1993}}</ref> Horthy called them \"my best men\".{{r|gunther1940}} The admiral also had practical reasons for overlooking the terror his officers wrought, since he needed the dedicated officers to help stabilize the country. Nevertheless, it was at least another year before the terror died down. In the summer of 1920, Horthy's government took measures to rein in and eventually disperse the reactionary battalions. Pr\u00f3nay managed to undermine these measures, but only for a short time.<ref name=\"Bodo\" /> Pr\u00f3nay was put on trial for extorting a wealthy Jewish politician, and for \"insulting the President of the Parliament\" by trying to cover up the extortion. Found guilty on both charges, Pr\u00f3nay was now a liability and an embarrassment. His command was revoked, and he was denounced as a common criminal on the floor of the Hungarian parliament.<ref name=\"Bodo\" />\n\nAfter serving short jail sentences, Pr\u00f3nay tried to convince Horthy to restore his battalion command. The Pr\u00f3nay Battalion lingered for a few months more under the command of a junior officer, but the government officially dissolved the unit in January 1922 and expelled its members from the army.<ref name=\"Bodo\" /> Pr\u00f3nay entered politics as a member of the government's right-wing opposition. In the 1930s, he sought and failed to emulate the Nazis by generating a Hungarian fascist mass movement. In 1932, he was charged with incitement, sentenced to six months in prison and stripped of his rank of lieutenant colonel. Pr\u00f3nay would support the pro-Nazi [[Arrow Cross]] and lead attacks on Jews before being captured by Soviet troops sometime during or after the [[Battle of Budapest]] of 1944\u201345, dying in captivity in 1947/48.<ref name=\"Bodo\" />\n\nPrecisely how much Horthy knew about the excesses of the White Terror is not known. Horthy himself declined to apologize for the savagery of his officer detachments, writing later, \"I have no reason to gloss over deeds of injustice and atrocities committed when an iron broom alone could sweep the country clean.\"<ref name=\"horthy\">{{cite book|last=Horthy: |first=Admiral Nicholas|others=Nicholas Horthy, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Andrew L.

It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago.

It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into a fateful alliance with Adolf Hitler.<blockquote>The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, on the banks of the Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the [[Crown of St. Stephen|Holy Crown]] and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags.

Instead, with National Army officers controlling the parliament building, the assembly voted to install Horthy as [[Regent]]; he defeated Count [[Albert Apponyi]] by a vote of 131 to 7.\n\nBishop [[Ottok\u00e1r Proh\u00e1szka]] then led a small delegation to meet Horthy, announcing, \"Hungary's Parliament has elected you Regent!

That cause was, primarily, reversing the losses of the Treaty of Trianon. The humiliations of the Trianon treaty continued to occupy a central place in Hungarian foreign policy and the popular imagination. The indignant anti-Trianon slogan \"Nem, nem soha!\" (\"No, no never!\") became a ubiquitous motto of Hungarian outrage. When in 1927 the British newspaper magnate [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] denounced the partitions ratified at Trianon in the pages of his ''Daily Mail'', an official letter of gratitude was eagerly signed by 1.2 million Hungarians.<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nBut Hungary's stability was precarious, and the [[Great Depression]] derailed much of Bethlen's economic balance. Horthy replaced him with an old reactionary confederate from his Szeged days: [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s was an outspoken anti-Semite and a budding fascist. Although he agreed to Horthy's demands that he temper his anti-Jewish rhetoric and work amicably with Hungary's large Jewish professional class, G\u00f6mb\u00f6s's tenure began swinging Hungary's political mood powerfully rightward. He strengthened Hungary's ties to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italian fascist state. Fatefully, when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933, he found in G\u00f6mb\u00f6s an admiring and obliging colleague.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[John Gunther]] stated that Horthy,\n\n{{quote|though reactionary as far as social or economic ideas are concerned, is in effect the guardian of constitutionalism and what vestigial democracy remains in the country, because it is largely his influence that prevents any prime minister from abolishing parliament and setting up dictatorial rule.<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n443/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=422\u2013423}}</ref>}}\n\nG\u00f6mb\u00f6s rescued the failing economy by securing trade guarantees from Germany \u2013 a strategy that positioned Germany as Hungary's primary trading partner and tied Hungary's future even more tightly to Hitler's.

One American diplomat remarked that Horthy's anti-Communist tirades were so common and ferocious that diplomats \"discounted it as a phobia\".<ref>The comments of U.S. Minister to Hungary Nicholas Roosevelt, quoted in Frank, Tibor, ''Discussing Hitler: Advisors of U.S. Diplomacy in Central Europe'', 1934\u20131941, Central European University press, 2003, pp. 14\u201316</ref>\n\nHorthy clearly saw his country as trapped between two stronger powers, both of them dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could \u2013 not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The means by which the regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one \u2013 largely due, he said, to his unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHorthy's attitude to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state that refused to accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was the most important factor in war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin.<ref name=\"Eby, Cecil page 9\">Eby, Cecil ''Hungary at War: Civilians and Soldiers in World War II'', University Park: Penn State Press, 2007 page 9.</ref> During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went on to tell Hitler that he must be careful not to do anything that might cause an Anglo\u2013German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the ''[[Third Reich|Reich]]''.<ref name=\"Eby, Cecil page 9\"/> Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn August 1938, when Horthy, his wife, and some Hungarian politicians took a special train from Budapest to Germany, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and other [[Nazism|National Socialist]] formations ceremonially welcomed the delegation at the [[Passau]] train station. The train then continued to [[Kiel]] for the [[Ceremonial ship launching|christening]] of the [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|German cruiser ''Prinz Eugen'']].<ref>Anna Rosmus, ''Hitlers Nibelungen'', Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 166f</ref>\n\nDuring his ensuing state visit, Hitler asked Horthy for troops and mat\u00e9riel to participate in Germany's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia. In exchange, Horthy later reported, \"He gave me to understand that as a reward we should be allowed to keep the territory we had invaded.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/> Horthy said he declined, insisting to Hitler that Hungary's claims on the disputed lands should be settled by peaceful means.<ref>Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, ''Memoirs''.

American journalists began to refer to Hungary as \"the jackal of Europe\".<ref>Wohlforth, William, ''Deadly Imbalances: Tripolarity and Hitler's Strategy of World Conquest'', Columbia University Press 1998, pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\nThis combination of menace and reward drifted Hungary closer to the status of a Nazi client state.<ref>John Flournoy Montgomery, ''Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite'' Part Two: An Oasis in Hitler's Desert</ref> In March 1939, when Hitler took what remained of Czechoslovakia by force, Hungary was allowed to annex [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. After a conflict with the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|First Slovak Republic]] during the [[Slovak\u2013Hungarian War]] of 1939, Hungary gained further territories. In August 1940, Hitler intervened on Hungary's behalf once again. After the failed Hungarian-Romanian negotiations, Hungary annexed [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania by the [[Second Vienna Award]].\n\n[[File:Kom\u00e1rno november 1938 (1).jpg|thumb|Horthy during the Hungarians' entry into Kom\u00e1rom (present-day [[Kom\u00e1rno]]), following the First Vienna Award, November 1938]]\n\nBut despite their cooperation with the Nazi regime, Horthy and his government would be better described as \"conservative authoritarian\"<ref>Mikl\u00f3s Lojk\u00f3. ''Meddling in Middle Europe: Britain and the 'Lands Between, 1919\u20131925'', Central European University Press, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q-IOJWicco8C&pg=PA180 p 180]</ref> than \"fascist\". Certainly Horthy was as hostile to the home-grown fascist and ultra-nationalist movements that emerged in Hungary between the wars (particularly the [[Arrow Cross Party]]) as he was to Communism. The Arrow Cross leader, [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], was repeatedly imprisoned at Horthy's command.\n\n[[John Flournoy Montgomery|John F. Montgomery]], who served in Budapest as U.S. ambassador from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Budapest opera house]] by chanting \"Justice for Sz\u00e1lasi!\" loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went to take a closer look, he discovered that:<blockquote>two or three men were on the floor and he [Horthy] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: \"So you would betray your country, would you?\" The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.<ref>Montgomery, John F. ''Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite'', Part One: What Price Independence?</ref></blockquote>[[File:Hungary 1941-44 Administrative Map.png|left|thumb|300 px|Hungary in 1941, after recovering territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia]]\n\nAnd yet, by the time of this episode, Horthy had allowed his government to give in to Nazi demands that the Hungarians enact laws restricting the lives of the country's Jews. The first Hungarian anti-Jewish Law, in 1938, limited the number of Jews in the professions, the government and commerce to twenty percent, and the second reduced it to five percent the following year; 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their jobs as a result. A \"Third Jewish Law\" of August 1941 prohibited Jews from marrying non-Jews and defined anyone having two Jewish grandparents as \"racially Jewish\". A Jewish man who had non-marital sex with a \"decent non-Jewish woman resident in Hungary\" could be sentenced to three years in prison.<ref>Patai, Raphael. ''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, p. 548</ref>\n\nHorthy's personal views on Jews and their role in Hungarian society are the subject of some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]], Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry \u2013 success that needed to be curtailed:<blockquote>As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, one of the most important tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, for we should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.<ref>{{harvnb|Patai||p=546}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===War===\n[[File:Mikl\u00f3s Horthy and Adolf Hitler 1938.jpg|thumb|Horthy with Hitler in 1938]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1944)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was gradually drawn into the war itself.  In 1939 and 1940, [[Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War|volunteer units]] fought in Finland's [[Winter War]]. In April 1941, Hungary became, in effect, a member of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].  Hungary permitted Hitler to send troops across Hungarian territory for the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and ultimately sent its own troops to claim its share of the dismembered [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]], horrified that he had failed to prevent this collusion with the Nazis against a former ally, committed suicide.\n\nIn June 1941, the Hungarian government finally yielded to Hitler's demands that the nation contribute to the Axis war effort. On 27 June, Hungary became part of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and declared war on the [[Soviet Union]].  The Hungarians sent in troops and material only four days after Hitler began his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.\n\nEighteen months later, less well-equipped and less motivated than their German allies, 200,000 troops of the [[Hungarian Second Army]] ended up holding the front on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] west of [[Stalingrad]].<ref>Deak, Istv\u00e1n, ''Endgame in Budapest'', Hungarian Quarterly, Autumn 2005</ref>\n\nThe first massacre of Jewish people from Hungarian territory took place in August 1941, when government officials ordered the deportation of Jews without Hungarian citizenship (principally refugees from other Nazi-occupied countries) to [[Ukraine]]. Roughly 18,000\u201320,000 of these deportees were slaughtered by [[Friedrich Jeckeln]] and his [[SS]] troops; only 2,000\u20133,000 survived. These killings are known as the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre]]. This event, in which the slaughter of Jews for the first time numbered in the tens of thousands, is considered to be among the first large-scale massacre of the [[Holocaust]]. Because of the objections of Hungary's leadership, the deportations were halted.<ref name=\"Holocaust in Hungary.

That March, he dismissed the pro-German prime minister [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy]], and replaced him with [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]], a moderate whom Horthy expected to loosen Hungary's ties to Germany.<ref>Borhi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, ''Hungary in the Cold War 1945\u20131956: Between the United States and the Soviet Union'', Central European University Press, New York 2004</ref>\n\nIn September 1942, personal tragedy struck the Hungarian Regent. 37-year-old [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], Horthy's eldest son, was killed.  Istv\u00e1n Horthy was the Deputy Regent of Hungary and a Flight Lieutenant in the reserves, 1/1 Fighter Squadron of the [[Royal Hungarian Air Force]]. He was killed when his Hawk (''[[M\u00c1VAG H\u00e9ja|H\u00e9ja]]'') fighter crashed at an air field near [[Ilovskoye]].\n\nIn January 1943, Hungary's enthusiasm for the war effort, never especially high, suffered a tremendous blow. The Soviet army, in the full momentum of its triumphant turnaround after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], punched through Romanian troops at a bend in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and virtually obliterated the Second Hungarian Army in a few days' fighting. In this single action, Hungarian combat fatalities jumped by 80,000. Jew and non-Jew suffered together in this defeat, as the Hungarian troops had been accompanied by some 40,000 Jews and political prisoners in forced-labour units whose job had been to clear minefields.<ref>L\u00e1z\u00e1r, Istv\u00e1n, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Chapter 14</ref>\n\nGerman officials blamed Hungary's Jews for the nation's \"defeatist attitude.\"  In the wake of the Don bend disaster, Hitler demanded at an April 1943 meeting that Horthy punish the 800,000 Jews still living in Hungary, who according to Hitler were responsible for this defeat. In response, Horthy and his government supplied 10,000 Jewish deportees for labour battalions. With the growing awareness the Allies might well win the war, it became more expedient not to comply with further German requests. Cautiously, the Hungarian government began to explore contacts with the Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender.<ref>Deak, ''Endgame in Budapest''</ref>\n\n===Occupation===\n{{main|Operation Margarethe}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-12A, Budapest, marschierende Pfeilkreuzler und Panzer VI.jpg|thumb|A German [[Tiger II]] with a column of Arrow Cross soldiers in Budapest]]\nBy 1944, the Axis was losing the war, and the [[Red Army]] was at Hungary's borders. Fearing that the Soviets would overrun the country, K\u00e1llay, with Horthy's approval, put out numerous feelers to the Allies.  He even promised to surrender unconditionally to them once they reached Hungarian territory.  An enraged Hitler summoned Horthy to a conference in [[Schloss Klessheim|Klessheim Castle]] near [[Salzburg]]. He pressured Horthy to make greater contributions to the war effort and again commanded him to assist in the killing of more of Hungary's Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horthy now permitted the deportation of a large number of Jews (the generally accepted figure is 100,000), but would not go further.<ref>Braham, Randolph, ''The Politics of Genocide'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 59\u201362</ref>\n\nThe conference was a ruse. As Horthy was returning home on 19 March, the [[Wehrmacht]] invaded and occupied Hungary. Horthy was told he could only stay in office if he dismissed K\u00e1llay and appointed a new government that would fully cooperate with Hitler and his plenipotentiary in Budapest, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]].  Knowing the likely alternative was a [[gauleiter]] who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other countries under Nazi occupation, Horthy acquiesced and appointed his ambassador to Germany, General [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], as prime minister.  The Germans originally wanted Horthy to reappoint [[B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy]] (who had been prime minister from 1938 to 1939), but Horthy had enough influence to get Veesenmayer to accept Szt\u00f3jay instead. Contrary to Horthy's hopes, Szt\u00f3jay's government eagerly proceeded to participate in the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe chief agents of this collaboration were [[Andor Jaross]], the Minister of the Interior, and his two rabidly anti-Semitic state secretaries, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Endre]] and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky]] (later to be known as the \"Deportation Trio\"). On 9 April, Prime Minister Szt\u00f3jay and the Germans obligated Hungary to place 300,000 Jewish people at the \"disposal\" of the Reich, in effect, sentencing most of Hungary's remaining Jews to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Five days later, on 14 April, Endre, Baky, and SS Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] commenced the deportation of the remaining Hungarian Jews. The [[Yellow badge|Yellow Star]], [[Ghetto]]ization laws, and deportation were accomplished in less than 8 weeks with the help of the new Hungarian government and authorities. The deportation of Hungarian Jews to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] began on 14 May 1944 and continued at a rate of 12\u201314,000 a day until 24 July.<ref>Richard J Evans, The Third Reich at War, pg 617\u2013618.</ref>\n\nUpon learning about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:<blockquote>Dear Szt\u00f3jay: I was aware that the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is the handling of the Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. As such, I was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken out of the hands of Deputy Minister L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Endre. Further more, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.<ref name=\"horthy\" /></blockquote>Just before the deportations began, two Slovak Jewish prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfr\u00e9d Wetzler]], escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the [[Vrba-Wetzler Report]], was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials.

This development, a sign of the failing German war effort, led Horthy in Budapest to reconsolidate his political position.  He ousted Szt\u00f3jay and the other Nazi-friendly ministers installed the preceding spring, replacing them with a new government under [[G\u00e9za Lakatos]].  He stopped the mass deportations of Jews and ordered the police to use deadly force if the Germans attempted to resume them.  While some smaller groups continued to be deported by train, the Germans did not press Horthy to ramp the pace back up to pre-August levels.  Indeed, when Horthy turned down Eichmann's request to restart the deportations, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered Eichmann to return to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert J.

Himmler ordered Eichmann to leave Budapest}}</ref>\n\nHorthy also renewed peace feelers to the Allies and began considering strategies for surrendering to the Allied force he distrusted the most: the Red Army.  Although Horthy was still bitterly anti-Communist, his dealings with the Nazis led him to conclude that the Soviets were the far lesser evil.  Working through his trustworthy General [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]], who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Horthy sought to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the Hungarian government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this, and on 11 October Horthy and the Soviets finally agreed to surrender terms.  On 15 October 1944, Horthy told his government ministers that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. He said, \"It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her.\"<ref name=\"williamson\"/> Horthy \"...informed a representative of the German Reich that we were about to conclude a military armistice with our former enemies and to cease all hostilities against them.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nThe Nazis had anticipated Horthy's move. On 15 October, after Horthy announced the armistice in a nationwide radio address, Hitler initiated [[Operation Panzerfaust]], sending commando [[Otto Skorzeny]] to Budapest with instructions to remove Horthy from power.  Horthy's son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Jr.]], was meeting with Soviet representatives to finalize the surrender when Skorzeny and his troops forced their way into the meeting and kidnapped the younger Horthy at gunpoint. Trussed up in a carpet, Mikl\u00f3s Jr. was immediately driven to the airport and flown to Germany to serve as a hostage. Skorzeny then brazenly led a convoy of German troops and four [[Tiger II]] tanks to the Vienna Gates of [[Buda Castle|Castle Hill]], where the Hungarians had been ordered not to resist. Though one unit had not received the order, the Germans quickly captured Castle Hill with minimal bloodshed:seven soldiers were killed and twenty-six wounded.<ref name=\"williamson\">{{cite web|url=http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |title=War and Game: Operation Panzerfaust |last=Williamson |first=Mitch |accessdate=16 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072245/http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHorthy was captured by Veesenmayer and his staff later on the 15th and taken to the Waffen SS office, where he was held overnight.  Vessenmayer told Horthy that unless he recanted the armistice and abdicated, his son would be killed the next morning.  The fascist Arrow Cross Party swiftly took over Budapest.  With his son's life in the balance, Horthy consented to sign a document officially abdicating his office and naming [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], leader of the Arrow Cross, as both head of state and prime minister.  Horthy understood that the Germans merely wanted the stamp of his prestige on a Nazi-sponsored Arrow Cross coup, but he signed anyway. As he later explained his capitulation: \"I neither resigned nor appointed Sz\u00e1lasi Premier. I merely exchanged my signature for my son's life. A signature wrung from a man at machine-gun point can have little legality.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nHorthy met Skorzeny three days later at Pfeffer-Wildenbruch's apartment and was told he would be transported to Germany in his own special train. Skorzeny told Horthy that he would be a \"guest of honour\" in a secure Bavarian castle. On 17 October, Horthy was personally escorted by Skorzeny into captivity<ref name=\"williamson\"/> at Schloss [[Hirschberg (Bavaria)|Hirschberg]] in [[Bavaria]], where he was guarded closely, but allowed to live in comfort.<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nWith the help of the SS, the Arrow Cross leadership moved swiftly to take command of the Hungarian armed forces, and to prevent the surrender that Horthy had arranged, even though Soviet troops were now deep inside the country. Sz\u00e1lasi resumed persecution of Jews and other \"undesirables\". In the three months between November 1944 and January 1945, Arrow Cross death squads shot 10,000 to 15,000 Jews on the banks of the [[Danube]]. The Arrow Cross also welcomed Adolf Eichmann back to Budapest, where he began the deportation of the city's surviving Jews. Eichmann never successfully completed this phase of his plans, thwarted in large measure by the efforts of Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]]. Out of a pre-war Hungarian Jewish population estimated at 825,000, only 260,000 survived.\n\nBy December 1944, Budapest was under siege by Soviet forces. The Arrow Cross leadership retreated across the Danube into the hills of Buda in late January, and by February the city surrendered to the Soviet forces.\n\nHorthy remained under house arrest in Bavaria until the war in Europe ended. On 29 April, his SS guardians fled in the face of the Allied advance. On 1 May, Horthy was first liberated, and then arrested, by elements of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. 7th Army]].<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\n==Exile==\nAfter his arrest, Horthy was moved through a variety of detention locations before finally arriving at the prison facility at [[Nuremberg]] in late September 1945. There he was asked to provide evidence to the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in preparation for the trial of the Nazi leadership. Although he was interviewed repeatedly about his contacts with some of the defendants, he did not testify in person. In Nuremberg he was reunited with his son, Mikl\u00f3s.\n\nHorthy gradually came to believe that his arrest had been arranged and choreographed by the Americans in order to protect him from the Russians. Indeed, the former regent reported being told that [[Josip Broz Tito]], the new ruler of Yugoslavia, asked that Horthy be charged with complicity with the [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|1942 massacre of Serbian and Jewish civilians]] by Hungarian troops in the [[Ba\u010dka]] region of [[Vojvodina]].<ref name=\"horthy\"/> Serbian historian Zvonimir Golubovi\u0107 has claimed that not only was Horthy aware of these genocidal massacres, but had approved of them.<ref>Zvonimir Golubovi\u0107, Racija u Ju\u017enoj Ba\u010dkoj, 1942. godine, Novi Sad, 1991.

Nagy said that [[Joseph Stalin]] was more forgiving: that Stalin told Nagy during a diplomatic meeting in April 1945 not to judge Horthy, because he was old and had offered an armistice in 1944.<ref>Nagy's 1948 memoirs, ''The Struggle Behind the Iron Curtain'', are quoted in Andrew Simon's annotations to Horthy's ''Memoirs'', in this case for Chapter 22</ref>\n\nOn 17 December 1945, Horthy was released from Nuremberg prison and allowed to rejoin his family in the German town of [[Weilheim in Oberbayern|Weilheim]], [[Bavaria]]. The Horthys lived there for four years, supported financially by ambassador John Montgomery, his successor, [[Herbert Pell]], and by [[Pope Pius XII]], whom he knew personally.\n\nIn March 1948, Horthy returned to testify at the [[Ministries Trial]], the last of the twelve U.S.-run Nuremberg Trials; he testified against [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], the Nazi administrator who had controlled Hungary during the deportations to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"horthy\"/> Veesenmayer was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, but was released in 1951.\n\nFor Horthy, returning to Hungary was impossible; it was now firmly in the hands of a Soviet-sponsored Communist government. In an extraordinary twist of fate, the chief of Hungary's post-war Communist apparatus was [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], one of [[B\u00e9la Kun]]'s colleagues from the ill-fated Communist coup of 1919. Kun had been executed during Stalin's purges of the late 1930s, but R\u00e1kosi had survived in a Hungarian prison cell; in 1940 Horthy had permitted R\u00e1kosi to emigrate to the Soviet Union in exchange for a series of highly symbolic Hungarian battle-flags from the 19th century that were in Russian hands.\n\nIn 1950, the Horthy family managed to find a home in Portugal, thanks to Mikl\u00f3s Jr.'s contacts with Portuguese diplomats in Switzerland. Horthy and members of his family were relocated to the seaside town of [[Estoril]], in the house address Rua Dom Afonso Henriques, 1937 2765.573 Estoril.\nHis American supporter, John Montgomery, recruited a small group of wealthy Hungarians to raise funds for their upkeep in exile. According to Horthy's daughter-in-law, Countess Ilona Edelsheim Gyulai, Hungarian Jews also supported Horthy's family in exile,<ref name=\"Frank\"/> including industrialist Ferenc Chorin and lawyer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Pathy.<ref>From the [http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&bookid=9&post=1 ''Annotated Memoirs of Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy''] (accessed 2009 September 5).</ref>\n\nIn exile, Horthy wrote his memoirs, ''Ein Leben f\u00fcr Ungarn'' (English: ''A Life for Hungary''), published under the name of Nikolaus von Horthy, in which he narrated many personal experiences from his youth until the end of World War II. He claimed that he had distrusted Hitler for much of the time he knew him and tried to perform the best actions and appoint the best officials in his country. He also highlighted Hungary's mistreatment by many other countries since the end of World War I. Horthy was one of the few Axis heads of state to survive the war, and thus to write post-war memoirs.\n\n[[File:Kenderes Horthy csal\u00e1di s\u00edrbolt.jpg|thumb|The Horthy family crypt in Kenderes, where Horthy himself was reburied in 1993]]\nHorthy never lost his deep contempt for communism, and in his memoirs he blamed Hungary's alliance with the Axis on the threat posed by the \"Asiatic barbarians\" of the Soviet Union. He railed against the influence that the Allies' victory had given to Stalin's totalitarian state.  \"I feel no urge to say 'I told you so,' \" Horthy wrote, \"nor to express bitterness at the experiences that have been forced upon me. Rather, I feel wonder and amazement at the vagaries of humanity.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nHe died in 1957 in [[Estoril]].\n\nHorthy married [[Magdolna Purgly|Magdolna Purgly de J\u00f3sz\u00e1shely]] in 1901; they were married for just over 56 years, until his death. He had two sons, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Jr.]] (often rendered in English as \"Nicholas\" or \"Nikolaus\") and [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], who served as his political assistants; and two daughters, Magda and Paula. Of his four children, only Mikl\u00f3s outlived him.\n\nAccording to footnotes in his memoirs, Horthy was very distraught about the failure of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. In his will, Horthy asked that his body not be returned to Hungary \"until the last Russian soldier has left.\" His heirs honoured the request. In 1993, two years after the Soviet troops left Hungary, Horthy's body was returned to Hungary and he was buried in his home town of [[Kenderes]]. The reburial in Hungary was the subject of some controversy on part of the left.<ref>Perlez, Jane, '\"Reburial is Both a Ceremony and a Test for Today's Hungary,\" ''The New York Times'', 5 September

Its legacy, and that of Horthy himself, remain among the most controversial political topics in Hungary today, tied inseparably to the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and the [[Holocaust]].  According to one school of thought, Horthy was a strong, conservative, but not undemocratic leader and patriot who only entered into an alliance with Hitler's Germany in order to restore lands Hungary lost after the First World War and was reluctant, or even defiant, in the face of Germany's demands to deport the Hungarian Jewry.<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> Others see Horthy's alliance with Germany as foolhardy,<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> or think that a positive view of Horthy serves a revisionist historical agenda,<ref>{{cite web|last1=LaCouter|first1=Travis|title=Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Addressing A Troubled Past|url=http://www.paprikapolitik.com/2012/07/miklos-horthy-addressing-a-troubled-past-2/|website=Paprika Politik|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> pointing to Horthy's passage of various anti-Jewish laws \u2013 the earliest in Europe, in 1920 \u2013 as a sign of his anti-Semitism and the prelude for the collaboration in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/>\n\nThe historiography and reception of Horthy has changed throughout the course of modern Hungarian history. He was officially denounced by the state during the communist era, while during his own time and in the 21st century, his reception has been more nuanced.\n\n===During the Horthy era===\n\nDuring his own reign, Horthy's reception was fairly positive, though by no means monolithic. Opponents of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet Republic]] saw him as a \"national saviour,\" in contrast to the communist \"losers of the nation.\"<ref name=\"Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Orsz\u00e1gment\u0151 6. oldal\">Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Orsz\u00e1gment\u0151 6. oldal</ref> Because Horthy distanced himself from everyday politics, he was able to cultivate the image of the nationally governing admiral.

Scholars agree that due to political pressure, Horthy's positive achievements were unmentioned while his negative aspects were exaggerated to the point of total distortion.\n\nThe communist takeover in 1945 saw the same powers that had denounced Horthy as an \"executioner\" and a \"murdering monster\" assume control of the state. The government systematically disseminated, through propaganda and state education, the idea that the Horthy era constituted the \"lowest point in Hungarian history.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> Most of these views were supported by socialist or communist activists persecuted under the Horthy administration. Especially critical in this campaign was the 1950 publication of the textbook ''The Story of the Hungarian People'', which denounced Horthy's military as a \"genocidal band\" consisting of \"sociopathic officers, [[kulak]]s, and the dregs of society.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> It further characterized Horthy himself as a \"slave of the Habsburgs,\" a \"red-handed dictator\" who \"spoke broken Hungarian\" and was known for his \"hatred of workers and [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> ''The Story of the Hungarian People'' was required reading in middle schools throughout the 1950s.<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/>\n\nThe situation only slowly improved. While the professionalization of Hungarian history and historiography coupled with the loosening of state ideological controls inevitably led to a fairer assessment of Horthy's life, popular volumes still painted him negatively.

The government's open support of the ceremony incited protests and international attention]]\nThe transition to a [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|Western-style democracy]] allowed the privatization of media, which led to a shift in how Horthy was viewed in Hungary. In 1993, only a few years after the first democratic elections, Horthy's body was returned from Portugal to his hometown of [[Kenderes]]. Tens of thousands of people, as well as almost the entirety of [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]]'s [[Hungarian Democratic Forum|MDF]] cabinet, attended the ceremony. Antall had prefaced the burial with a series of interviews praising Horthy as a \"patriot.\"<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Perlez|first1=Jane|title=Reburial Is Both a Ceremony and a Test for Today's Hungary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/world/reburial-is-both-a-ceremony-and-a-test-for-today-s-hungary.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=The New York Times|date=5 September 1993}}</ref> The reburial was broadcast on state television and was accompanied by large-scale protests in Budapest.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/>\n\nIn contemporary Hungary, hagiography of Horthy is associated with the far-right [[Jobbik]] and its allies. Since 2012, Horthy statues, squares, or memorials have been erected in numerous villages and cities including [[Cs\u00f3kak\u0151]],<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> [[Kereki]], [[Gy\u00f6mr\u0151]], and [[Debrecen]].<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/> In November 2013, a Horthy statue's unveiling at a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church in Budapest drew international attention and criticism.<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/>\n\n''[[Der Spiegel]]'' has written about the resurgence of what its writers call \"the Horthy cult,\" claiming that Horthy's popularity indicates returning irredentist, reactionary, and ultranationalistic elements.<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/> Critics have more specifically connected Horthy's popularity to the ''[[Magyar G\u00e1rda]]'', a paramilitary group that uses [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]] imagery and to recent incidents of [[antiziganism|antiziganist]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] vandalism in Hungary.<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> The ruling [[Fidesz]] party has, according to reporters, \"hedged its bets\" on the Horthy controversy, refusing to outright condemn Horthy statues and other commemorations for fear of losing far-right voters to Jobbik, although some Fidesz politicians have labeled Horthy memorials \"provocative.\"<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/> This tension has led some to label Fidesz as \"implicitly anti-semitic\" and to accuse Prime Minister [[Viktor Orb\u00e1n]] of a \"revisionist\" agenda.<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/>\n\nLeft-wing groups such as the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] have condemned positive historiography of Horthy. [[Attila Mesterh\u00e1zy]], the socialist leader, has condemned the Orb\u00e1n government's position as \"inexcusable\", claiming that Fidesz was \"openly associating itself with the ideology of the regime that collaborated with the fascists.\"<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> Words have led to actions in some instances, for example when leftist activist P\u00e9ter D\u00e1niel vandalized a rural bust of Horthy by dousing it in red paint and hanging a sign that read \"Mass Murderer \u2013 War Criminal\" around its neck. Right-wing activists responded by vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]].<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/>\n\nIn 2017, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Hungary, made a speech in which he called Horthy an \"exceptional statesman\" and gave him the credit for the survival of Hungary. The [[U.S. Holocaust Museum]] then issued a statement denouncing Orb\u00e1n and the Hungarian government for trying to \"rehabilitate the reputation of Hungary\u2019s wartime leader, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, who was a vocal anti-Semite and complicit in the murder of the country\u2019s Jewish population during the Holocaust.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Krupkin |first=Taly |url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-1.798471 |title=U.S. Holocaust museum denounces Hungarian PM for erasing wartime crimes \u2013 U.S. News |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television portrayals==\nIn the 1985 NBC TV film ''[[Wallenberg: A Hero's Story]]'', the role of Horthy was taken by Hungarian-born actor [[Guy Deghy]], who appeared bearded although Horthy (as photographs bore out) appeared consistently clean-shaven throughout his life.\n\nIn the 2011 Spanish TV film series, ''[[El \u00e1ngel de Budapest]]'' (The angel of Budapest), also set during Wallenberg's time in Hungary in 1944, he is portrayed by actor [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ag\u00e1rdi]].

He saw action in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] and became Commander-in-Chief of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] Navy in the last year of the [[First World War]]; he was promoted to [[Vice-Admiral]] and Commander of the Fleet when the previous Admiral was dismissed from his post by [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Karl]] following mutinies. In 1919, following [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918\u201320)|a series of revolutions and external interventions in Hungary]] from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Horthy returned to Budapest with the National Army and was subsequently invited to become Regent of the Kingdom by parliament.\n\nHorthy led a [[national conservatism|national conservative]]<ref>John Laughland: ''A History of Political Trials: From Charles I to Saddam Hussein'', Peter Lang Ltd, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1sRMIZGX9UMC&pg=PA143&dq=%22National+conservative%22+Horthy&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22National%20conservative%22%20Horthy&f=false]</ref>\ngovernment through the [[interwar period]], banning the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] as well as the [[Arrow Cross Party]], and pursuing an [[irredentism|irredentist]] foreign policy in the face of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. [[Charles IV of Hungary|King Charles IV]] unsuccessfully attempted twice to return to Hungary until, in 1921, the Hungarian Government caved in to Allied threats to renew hostilities. King Charles was escorted out of Hungary on a British warship into exile.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Horthy's foreign policy led him into a reluctant alliance with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. With the begrudging support of [[Adolf Hitler]], Horthy was able to recover certain Hungarian lands removed from them by the Allies. Under Horthy's leadership, Hungary gave support to [[Poles|Polish]] refugees in 1939 and participated in a supportive (as opposed to front-line) role in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941]], and during the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] the same year occupied and annexed former Hungarian territories which had been given to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929 [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) by the Allies after the First World War. Horthy's reluctance to contribute to the German war effort and the [[Holocaust in Hungary]], as well as refusing to hand over more than 600,000 of the 825,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] to German authorities, coupled with several attempts to strike a secret deal with the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies of World War II]] after it had become obvious that Axis would lose the war, eventually led the Germans to invade and take control of the country in March 1944 in [[Operation Margarethe]]. In October 1944, Horthy announced that Hungary had declared an armistice with the Allies and withdrawn from the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. He was forced to resign, placed under arrest by the Germans and taken to [[Bavaria]]. At the end of the war, he came under the custody of American troops.<ref>von Papen, Franz, ''Memoirs'', London, 1952, pps:541-23, 546.</ref>\n\nAfter appearing as a witness at the [[Ministries Trial|Nuremberg war-crimes trials]] in 1948, Horthy settled and lived out his remaining years in exile in [[Portugal]].

Horthy married [[Magdolna Purgly]] in Arad in 1901. They had 4 children: Magdolna (1902), Paula (1903), [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy|Istv\u00e1n]] (1904) and [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Jr.|Mikl\u00f3s]] (1907).

In 1915, he earned a reputation for boldness while commanding the new light cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}}. He planned the 1917 attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]], which resulted in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]], the largest naval engagement of the war in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. A consolidated British, French and Italian fleet met the Austro-Hungarian force. Despite the numerical superiority of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] fleet, the Austrian force emerged from the battle victorious. The Austrian fleet remained relatively unscathed, however Horthy was wounded. After the [[Cattaro mutiny]] of February 1918, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] (Charles IV as King of Hungary) selected Horthy over many more senior commanders as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Fleet in March 1918. In June, Horthy planned another attack on Otranto, and in a departure from the cautious strategy of his predecessors, he committed the empire's battleships to the mission. While sailing through the night, the dreadnought {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} met Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]] and was sunk, causing Horthy to abort the mission. He managed to preserve the rest of the empire's [[fleet in being]] until he was ordered by Emperor Charles to surrender it to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (the predecessor of Yugoslavia) on 31 October.<ref name=\"TuckerWood1996\"/>\n\nThe end of the war saw Hungary turned into a landlocked nation, and with that, the new government had little need for Horthy's services. He retired with his family to his private estate at [[Kenderes]], but his role as a Hungarian leader was far from over.\n\n===Dates of rank and assignments===\n[[File:Novaral.jpg|thumb|The damaged [[SMS Novara (1913)|SMS ''Novara'']] after the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of Otranto]]]]\n[[File:Hswoon.png|thumb|Horthy, seriously wounded, commanded the fleet at the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|battle of Otranto Strait]] until falling unconscious]]\n\n* 1896 ''[[Fregattenleutnant]]'' (Frigate Lieutenant) (''fregatthadnagy'' \u2013 Sub-Lieutenant)\n* 1900 ''Linienschiffleutnant'' (Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant) (''sorhaj\u00f3hadnagy'' \u2013 Lieutenant)\n* January 1901 SMS Sperber (commander of the vessel)\n* 1902 SMS ''Kranich'' (commander of the vessel)\n* June 1908 SMS ''Taurus'' (commander of the vessel)\n* August 1908 {{SMS|Kaiser Karl VI}} (GDO-Gesamtdetailoffizier-First Officer, temporary)\n* 1 January 1909 ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Corvette Captain) (''korvettkapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Lieutenant-Commander]])\n* 1 November 1909 aide-de-camp to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef]]\n* 1 November 1911 ''[[Fregattenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Frigate Captain) (''fregattkapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Commander]])\n* December 1912 March 1913 {{SMS|Budapest}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 20 January 1914 ''[[Linienschiffskapit\u00e4n]]'' (Ship-of-the-Line Captain) (''sorhaj\u00f3kapit\u00e1ny'' \u2013 [[Captain (naval)|Captain]])\n* August 1914 {{SMS|Habsburg}} (commander of the vessel)\n* December 1914 {{SMS|Novara|1912|6}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 1 February 1918 {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912}} (commander of the vessel)\n* 27 February 1918 ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (''ellentengernagy'' \u2013 [[Rear Admiral]])\n* 27 February 1918 appointed (last) Commander in Chief of the fleet (over 11 admirals and 24 senior ''Linienschiffskapit\u00e4n'') by [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Karl I]]\n* 30 October 1918 ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (''altengernagy'' \u2013 [[Vice Admiral]])\n\n==Interwar period, 1919\u20131939==\n===Commander of the National Army===\n[[File:Horthy enters Budapest.webm|thumb|350px|Horthy enters Budapest, 16 November 1919 (1080p film footage)]]\nTwo national traumas that followed the First World War profoundly shaped the spirit and future of the Hungarian nation. The first was the loss, as dictated by the [[Allies of World War I]], of large portions of Hungarian territory that had bordered other countries. These were lands that had belonged to Hungary (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) but were now ceded mainly to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The excisions, eventually ratified in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, cost Hungary two-thirds of its territory and one-third of its native Hungarian speakers; this dealt the population a terrible psychological blow. The second trauma began in March 1919, when the Communist leader [[B\u00e9la Kun]] seized power in the capital, [[Budapest]], after the first proto-democratic government in Hungary faltered.<ref>L\u00e1z\u00e1r, Istv\u00e1n, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Budapest: Corvina, 1993 (English edition) Translated by Albert Tezla; Chapter 13</ref>\n\nKun and his colleagues proclaimed a [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and promised the restoration of Hungary's former grandeur. Instead, his efforts at reconquest failed, and Hungarians were treated to a Soviet-style repression in the form of [[Lenin Boys|armed gangs]] who intimidated or murdered enemies of the regime. This period of violence came to be known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]].<ref>Deak, Istvan, \"A Hungarian Admiral on Horseback\", from ''Essays on Hitler's Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2001, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nWithin weeks of his coup, Kun's popularity plummeted. On 30 May 1919, anti-Communist politicians formed a counter-revolutionary government in the southern city of [[Szeged]], which was occupied by French forces at the time. There, [[Gyula K\u00e1rolyi]], the prime minister of the counter-revolutionary government, asked former admiral Horthy, still considered a war hero, to be the Minister of War in the new government and take command of a counter-revolutionary force that would be named the National Army ({{lang-hu|Nemzeti Hadsereg}}). Horthy consented, and he arrived in Szeged on 6 June. Soon afterwards, because of orders from the Allied powers, a cabinet was reformed, and Horthy was not given a seat in it. Undaunted, Horthy managed to retain control of the National Army by detaching the army command from the War Ministry.\n\nAfter the Communist government collapsed and its leaders fled, French-supported Romanian forces entered Budapest on 6 August 1919. In retaliation for the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]], reactionary crews now exacted revenge in a two-year wave of violent repression known today as the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]]. These reprisals were organized and carried out by officers of Horthy's National Army, particularly [[P\u00e1l Pr\u00f3nay]],<ref name=\"Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469\">Patai, Raphael, ''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 468\u2013469</ref> Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Iv\u00e1n H\u00e9jjas.<ref name=\"Bodo\">Bod\u00f3, B\u00e9la: ''Paramilitary Violence in Hungary After the First World War'', East European Quarterly, No. 2, Vol. 38, 22 June 2004</ref> Their victims were primarily [[Communist]]s, [[Social Democrats]], and Jews. Most Hungarian Jews were not supporters of the Bolsheviks, but much of the leadership of the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been young Jewish intellectuals, and anger about the Communist revolution easily translated into anti-Semitic hostility.<ref name=\"Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469\"/>\n\nIn Budapest, Pr\u00f3nay installed his unit in the Hotel Britannia, where the group swelled to [[battalion]] size. Their program of vicious attacks continued; they planned a citywide [[pogrom]] against the Jews until Horthy found out and put a stop to it. In his diary, Pr\u00f3nay reported that Horthy:<blockquote>reproached me for the many Jewish corpses found in the various parts of the country, especially in the Transdanubia. This, he emphasized, gave the foreign press extra ammunitions against us. He told me that we should stop harassing small Jews; instead, we should kill some big (Kun government) Jews such as Somogyi or V\u00e1zsonyi \u2013 these people deserve punishment much more... in vain, I tried to convince him that the liberal papers would be against us anyway, and it did not matter that we killed only one Jew or we killed them all<ref>Szabo and Pamlenyi: ''A hatarban a halal kaszal'', pp.160 and 131</ref></blockquote>The degree of Horthy's responsibility for the excesses of Pr\u00f3nay is disputed. On several occasions, Horthy reached out to stop Pr\u00f3nay from a particularly excessive burst of anti-Jewish cruelty, and the Jews of Pest went on record absolving Horthy of the White Terror as early as the fall of 1919, when they released a statement disavowing the Kun revolution and blaming the terror on a few units within the National Army. Horthy has never been found to have personally engaged in White Terror atrocities.  But his American biographer [[Thomas L. Sakmyster]] concluded that he \"tacitly supported the right wing officer detachments\" who carried out the terror;<ref>{{cite book | last = Sakmyster | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = Thomas L. Sakmyster | title = Hungary's Admiral on Horseback: Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, 1918\u20131944 | publisher = Columbia University Press = date = 1993}}</ref> Horthy called them \"my best men\".{{r|gunther1940}} The admiral also had practical reasons for overlooking the terror his officers wrought, since he needed the dedicated officers to help stabilize the country. Nevertheless, it was at least another year before the terror died down. In the summer of 1920, Horthy's government took measures to rein in and eventually disperse the reactionary battalions. Pr\u00f3nay managed to undermine these measures, but only for a short time.<ref name=\"Bodo\" /> Pr\u00f3nay was put on trial for extorting a wealthy Jewish politician, and for \"insulting the President of the Parliament\" by trying to cover up the extortion. Found guilty on both charges, Pr\u00f3nay was now a liability and an embarrassment. His command was revoked, and he was denounced as a common criminal on the floor of the Hungarian parliament.<ref name=\"Bodo\" />\n\nAfter serving short jail sentences, Pr\u00f3nay tried to convince Horthy to restore his battalion command. The Pr\u00f3nay Battalion lingered for a few months more under the command of a junior officer, but the government officially dissolved the unit in January 1922 and expelled its members from the army.<ref name=\"Bodo\" /> Pr\u00f3nay entered politics as a member of the government's right-wing opposition. In the 1930s, he sought and failed to emulate the Nazis by generating a Hungarian fascist mass movement. In 1932, he was charged with incitement, sentenced to six months in prison and stripped of his rank of lieutenant colonel. Pr\u00f3nay would support the pro-Nazi [[Arrow Cross]] and lead attacks on Jews before being captured by Soviet troops sometime during or after the [[Battle of Budapest]] of 1944\u201345, dying in captivity in 1947/48.<ref name=\"Bodo\" />\n\nPrecisely how much Horthy knew about the excesses of the White Terror is not known. Horthy himself declined to apologize for the savagery of his officer detachments, writing later, \"I have no reason to gloss over deeds of injustice and atrocities committed when an iron broom alone could sweep the country clean.\"<ref name=\"horthy\">{{cite book|last=Horthy: |first=Admiral Nicholas|others=Nicholas Horthy, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Andrew L.

It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into a fateful alliance with Adolf Hitler.<blockquote>The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, on the banks of the Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the [[Crown of St. Stephen|Holy Crown]] and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags.

It was apparent that the Allies of World War I would not accept any return of King Charles IV (the former Austro-Hungarian emperor) from exile. Instead, with National Army officers controlling the parliament building, the assembly voted to install Horthy as [[Regent]]; he defeated Count [[Albert Apponyi]] by a vote of 131 to 7.\n\nBishop [[Ottok\u00e1r Proh\u00e1szka]] then led a small delegation to meet Horthy, announcing, \"Hungary's Parliament has elected you Regent! Would it please you to accept the office of Regent of Hungary?\" To their astonishment, Horthy declined, unless the powers of the office were expanded. As Horthy stalled, the politicians gave in to his demands and granted him \"the general prerogatives of the king, with the exception of the right to name titles of nobility and of the patronage of the Church.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/> The prerogatives he was given included the power to appoint and dismiss prime ministers, to convene and dissolve parliament, and to command the [[Royal Hungarian Army|armed forces]].

Horthy's chief partner in these efforts was his prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]].

That cause was, primarily, reversing the losses of the Treaty of Trianon. The humiliations of the Trianon treaty continued to occupy a central place in Hungarian foreign policy and the popular imagination. The indignant anti-Trianon slogan \"Nem, nem soha!\" (\"No, no never!\") became a ubiquitous motto of Hungarian outrage. When in 1927 the British newspaper magnate [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] denounced the partitions ratified at Trianon in the pages of his ''Daily Mail'', an official letter of gratitude was eagerly signed by 1.2 million Hungarians.<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nBut Hungary's stability was precarious, and the [[Great Depression]] derailed much of Bethlen's economic balance. Horthy replaced him with an old reactionary confederate from his Szeged days: [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s was an outspoken anti-Semite and a budding fascist. Although he agreed to Horthy's demands that he temper his anti-Jewish rhetoric and work amicably with Hungary's large Jewish professional class, G\u00f6mb\u00f6s's tenure began swinging Hungary's political mood powerfully rightward. He strengthened Hungary's ties to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italian fascist state. Fatefully, when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933, he found in G\u00f6mb\u00f6s an admiring and obliging colleague.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[John Gunther]] stated that Horthy,\n\n{{quote|though reactionary as far as social or economic ideas are concerned, is in effect the guardian of constitutionalism and what vestigial democracy remains in the country, because it is largely his influence that prevents any prime minister from abolishing parliament and setting up dictatorial rule.<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n443/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=422\u2013423}}</ref>}}\n\nG\u00f6mb\u00f6s rescued the failing economy by securing trade guarantees from Germany \u2013 a strategy that positioned Germany as Hungary's primary trading partner and tied Hungary's future even more tightly to Hitler's. He also assured Hitler that Hungary would quickly become a one-party state modelled on the Nazi party control of Germany. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s died in 1936, before he realized his most extreme goals, but he left his nation headed into firm partnership with the German dictator.\n\n==World War II and the Holocaust==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Uneasy alliance===\nHungary now entered into intricate political maneuvers with the regime of Adolf Hitler, and Horthy began to play a greater and more public role in navigating Hungary along this dangerous path.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-1017-526, Berlin, Reichskanzlei.jpg|thumb|German and Hungarian flags in Berlin]]\nFor Horthy, Hitler served as a bulwark against Soviet encroachment or invasion. Horthy was, in the eyes of observers,{{Who|date=August 2016}} obsessed with the Communist threat. One American diplomat remarked that Horthy's anti-Communist tirades were so common and ferocious that diplomats \"discounted it as a phobia\".<ref>The comments of U.S. Minister to Hungary Nicholas Roosevelt, quoted in Frank, Tibor, ''Discussing Hitler: Advisors of U.S. Diplomacy in Central Europe'', 1934\u20131941, Central European University press, 2003, pp. 14\u201316</ref>\n\nHorthy clearly saw his country as trapped between two stronger powers, both of them dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could \u2013 not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The means by which the regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one \u2013 largely due, he said, to his unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHorthy's attitude to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state that refused to accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was the most important factor in war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin.<ref name=\"Eby, Cecil page 9\">Eby, Cecil ''Hungary at War: Civilians and Soldiers in World War II'', University Park: Penn State Press, 2007 page 9.</ref> During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went on to tell Hitler that he must be careful not to do anything that might cause an Anglo\u2013German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the ''[[Third Reich|Reich]]''.<ref name=\"Eby, Cecil page 9\"/> Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn August 1938, when Horthy, his wife, and some Hungarian politicians took a special train from Budapest to Germany, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and other [[Nazism|National Socialist]] formations ceremonially welcomed the delegation at the [[Passau]] train station.

Certainly Horthy was as hostile to the home-grown fascist and ultra-nationalist movements that emerged in Hungary between the wars (particularly the [[Arrow Cross Party]]) as he was to Communism. The Arrow Cross leader, [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], was repeatedly imprisoned at Horthy's command.\n\n[[John Flournoy Montgomery|John F. Montgomery]], who served in Budapest as U.S. ambassador from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Budapest opera house]] by chanting \"Justice for Sz\u00e1lasi!\" loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went to take a closer look, he discovered that:<blockquote>two or three men were on the floor and he [Horthy] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: \"So you would betray your country, would you?\" The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.<ref>Montgomery, John F. ''Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite'', Part One: What Price Independence?</ref></blockquote>[[File:Hungary 1941-44 Administrative Map.png|left|thumb|300 px|Hungary in 1941, after recovering territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia]]\n\nAnd yet, by the time of this episode, Horthy had allowed his government to give in to Nazi demands that the Hungarians enact laws restricting the lives of the country's Jews. The first Hungarian anti-Jewish Law, in 1938, limited the number of Jews in the professions, the government and commerce to twenty percent, and the second reduced it to five percent the following year; 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their jobs as a result. A \"Third Jewish Law\" of August 1941 prohibited Jews from marrying non-Jews and defined anyone having two Jewish grandparents as \"racially Jewish\".

''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, p. 548</ref>\n\nHorthy's personal views on Jews and their role in Hungarian society are the subject of some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]], Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry \u2013 success that needed to be curtailed:<blockquote>As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, one of the most important tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, for we should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.<ref>{{harvnb|Patai||p=546}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===War===\n[[File:Mikl\u00f3s Horthy and Adolf Hitler 1938.jpg|thumb|Horthy with Hitler in 1938]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1944)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was gradually drawn into the war itself.  In 1939 and 1940, [[Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War|volunteer units]] fought in Finland's [[Winter War]]. In April 1941, Hungary became, in effect, a member of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].  Hungary permitted Hitler to send troops across Hungarian territory for the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and ultimately sent its own troops to claim its share of the dismembered [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]], horrified that he had failed to prevent this collusion with the Nazis against a former ally, committed suicide.\n\nIn June 1941, the Hungarian government finally yielded to Hitler's demands that the nation contribute to the Axis war effort. On 27 June, Hungary became part of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and declared war on the [[Soviet Union]].  The Hungarians sent in troops and material only four days after Hitler began his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.\n\nEighteen months later, less well-equipped and less motivated than their German allies, 200,000 troops of the [[Hungarian Second Army]] ended up holding the front on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] west of [[Stalingrad]].<ref>Deak, Istv\u00e1n, ''Endgame in Budapest'', Hungarian Quarterly, Autumn 2005</ref>\n\nThe first massacre of Jewish people from Hungarian territory took place in August 1941, when government officials ordered the deportation of Jews without Hungarian citizenship (principally refugees from other Nazi-occupied countries) to [[Ukraine]]. Roughly 18,000\u201320,000 of these deportees were slaughtered by [[Friedrich Jeckeln]] and his [[SS]] troops; only 2,000\u20133,000 survived. These killings are known as the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre]]. This event, in which the slaughter of Jews for the first time numbered in the tens of thousands, is considered the first large-scale massacre of the [[Holocaust]]. Because of the objections of Hungary's leadership, the deportations were halted.<ref name=\"Holocaust in Hungary.

That March, he dismissed the pro-German prime minister [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy]], and replaced him with [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]], a moderate whom Horthy expected to loosen Hungary's ties to Germany.<ref>Borhi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, ''Hungary in the Cold War 1945\u20131956: Between the United States and the Soviet Union'', Central European University Press, New York 2004</ref>\n\nIn September 1942, personal tragedy struck the Hungarian Regent. 37-year-old [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], Horthy's eldest son, was killed.  Istv\u00e1n Horthy was the Deputy Regent of Hungary and a Flight Lieutenant in the reserves, 1/1 Fighter Squadron of the [[Royal Hungarian Air Force]]. He was killed when his Hawk (''[[M\u00c1VAG H\u00e9ja|H\u00e9ja]]'') fighter crashed at an air field near [[Ilovskoye]].\n\nIn January 1943, Hungary's enthusiasm for the war effort, never especially high, suffered a tremendous blow. The Soviet army, in the full momentum of its triumphant turnaround after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], punched through Romanian troops at a bend in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and virtually obliterated the Second Hungarian Army in a few days' fighting. In this single action, Hungarian combat fatalities jumped by 80,000. Jew and non-Jew suffered together in this defeat, as the Hungarian troops had been accompanied by some 40,000 Jews and political prisoners in forced-labour units whose job had been to clear minefields.<ref>L\u00e1z\u00e1r, Istv\u00e1n, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Chapter 14</ref>\n\nGerman officials blamed Hungary's Jews for the nation's \"defeatist attitude.\"  In the wake of the Don bend disaster, Hitler demanded at an April 1943 meeting that Horthy punish the 800,000 Jews still living in Hungary, who according to Hitler were responsible for this defeat. In response, Horthy and his government supplied 10,000 Jewish deportees for labour battalions. With the growing awareness the Allies might well win the war, it became more expedient not to comply with further German requests. Cautiously, the Hungarian government began to explore contacts with the Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender.<ref>Deak, ''Endgame in Budapest''</ref>\n\n===Occupation===\n{{main|Operation Margarethe}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-12A, Budapest, marschierende Pfeilkreuzler und Panzer VI.jpg|thumb|A German [[Tiger II]] with a column of Arrow Cross soldiers in Budapest]]\nBy 1944, the Axis was losing the war, and the [[Red Army]] was at Hungary's borders. Fearing that the Soviets would overrun the country, K\u00e1llay, with Horthy's approval, put out numerous feelers to the Allies.  He even promised to surrender unconditionally to them once they reached Hungarian territory.  An enraged Hitler summoned Horthy to a conference in [[Schloss Klessheim|Klessheim Castle]] near [[Salzburg]]. He pressured Horthy to make greater contributions to the war effort and again commanded him to assist in the killing of more of Hungary's Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horthy now permitted the deportation of a large number of Jews (the generally accepted figure is 100,000), but would not go further.<ref>Braham, Randolph, ''The Politics of Genocide'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 59\u201362</ref>\n\nThe conference was a ruse. As Horthy was returning home on 19 March, the [[Wehrmacht]] invaded and occupied Hungary. Horthy was told he could only stay in office if he dismissed K\u00e1llay and appointed a new government that would fully cooperate with Hitler and his plenipotentiary in Budapest, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]].  Knowing the likely alternative was a [[gauleiter]] who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other countries under Nazi occupation, Horthy acquiesced and appointed his ambassador to Germany, General [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], as prime minister.  The Germans originally wanted Horthy to reappoint [[B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy]] (who had been prime minister from 1938 to 1939), but Horthy had enough influence to get Veesenmayer to accept Szt\u00f3jay instead. Contrary to Horthy's hopes, Szt\u00f3jay's government eagerly proceeded to participate in the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe chief agents of this collaboration were [[Andor Jaross]], the Minister of the Interior, and his two rabidly anti-Semitic state secretaries, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Endre]] and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky]] (later to be known as the \"Deportation Trio\"). On 9 April, Prime Minister Szt\u00f3jay and the Germans obligated Hungary to place 300,000 Jewish people at the \"disposal\" of the Reich, in effect, sentencing most of Hungary's remaining Jews to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Five days later, on 14 April, Endre, Baky, and SS Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] commenced the deportation of the remaining Hungarian Jews. The [[Yellow badge|Yellow Star]], [[Ghetto]]ization laws, and deportation were accomplished in less than 8 weeks with the help of the new Hungarian government and authorities. The deportation of Hungarian Jews to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] began on 14 May 1944 and continued at a rate of 12\u201314,000 a day until 24 July.<ref>Richard J Evans, The Third Reich at War, pg 617\u2013618.</ref>\n\nUpon learning about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:<blockquote>Dear Szt\u00f3jay: I was aware that the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is the handling of the Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. As such, I was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken out of the hands of Deputy Minister L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Endre. Further more, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.<ref name=\"horthy\" /></blockquote>Just before the deportations began, two Slovak Jewish prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfr\u00e9d Wetzler]], escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the [[Vrba-Wetzler Report]], was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials. Details from the report were broadcast by the BBC on 15 June and printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 20 June.<ref name=Rees>[[Laurence Rees|Rees, Laurence]], ''Auschwitz: A New History'', Public Affairs, 2005. {{ISBN|1-58648-357-9}}</ref> World leaders, including [[Pope Pius XII]] (25 June), President [[Franklin D.

This development, a sign of the failing German war effort, led Horthy in Budapest to reconsolidate his political position.  He ousted Szt\u00f3jay and the other Nazi-friendly ministers installed the preceding spring, replacing them with a new government under [[G\u00e9za Lakatos]].  He stopped the mass deportations of Jews and ordered the police to use deadly force if the Germans attempted to resume them.  While some smaller groups continued to be deported by train, the Germans did not press Horthy to ramp the pace back up to pre-August levels.  Indeed, when Horthy turned down Eichmann's request to restart the deportations, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered Eichmann to return to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert J.

Himmler ordered Eichmann to leave Budapest}}</ref>\n\nHorthy also renewed peace feelers to the Allies and began considering strategies for surrendering to the Allied force he distrusted the most: the Red Army.  Although Horthy was still bitterly anti-Communist, his dealings with the Nazis led him to conclude that the Soviets were the far lesser evil.  Working through his trustworthy General [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]], who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Horthy sought to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the Hungarian government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this, and on 11 October Horthy and the Soviets finally agreed to surrender terms.  On 15 October 1944, Horthy told his government ministers that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. He said, \"It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her.\"<ref name=\"williamson\"/> Horthy \"...informed a representative of the German Reich that we were about to conclude a military armistice with our former enemies and to cease all hostilities against them.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nThe Nazis had anticipated Horthy's move. On 15 October, after Horthy announced the armistice in a nationwide radio address, Hitler initiated [[Operation Panzerfaust]], sending commando [[Otto Skorzeny]] to Budapest with instructions to remove Horthy from power.  Horthy's son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Jr.]], was meeting with Soviet representatives to finalize the surrender when Skorzeny and his troops forced their way into the meeting and kidnapped the younger Horthy at gunpoint. Trussed up in a carpet, Mikl\u00f3s Jr. was immediately driven to the airport and flown to Germany to serve as a hostage. Skorzeny then brazenly led a convoy of German troops and four [[Tiger II]] tanks to the Vienna Gates of [[Buda Castle|Castle Hill]], where the Hungarians had been ordered not to resist. Though one unit had not received the order, the Germans quickly captured Castle Hill with minimal bloodshed:seven soldiers were killed and twenty-six wounded.<ref name=\"williamson\">{{cite web|url=http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |title=War and Game: Operation Panzerfaust |last=Williamson |first=Mitch |accessdate=16 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072245/http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHorthy was captured by Veesenmayer and his staff later on the 15th and taken to the Waffen SS office, where he was held overnight.  Vessenmayer told Horthy that unless he recanted the armistice and abdicated, his son would be killed the next morning.  The fascist Arrow Cross Party swiftly took over Budapest.  With his son's life in the balance, Horthy consented to sign a document officially abdicating his office and naming [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], leader of the Arrow Cross, as both head of state and prime minister.  Horthy understood that the Germans merely wanted the stamp of his prestige on a Nazi-sponsored Arrow Cross coup, but he signed anyway. As he later explained his capitulation: \"I neither resigned nor appointed Sz\u00e1lasi Premier. I merely exchanged my signature for my son's life. A signature wrung from a man at machine-gun point can have little legality.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nHorthy met Skorzeny three days later at Pfeffer-Wildenbruch's apartment and was told he would be transported to Germany in his own special train. Skorzeny told Horthy that he would be a \"guest of honour\" in a secure Bavarian castle. On 17 October, Horthy was personally escorted by Skorzeny into captivity<ref name=\"williamson\"/> at Schloss [[Hirschberg (Bavaria)|Hirschberg]] in [[Bavaria]], where he was guarded closely, but allowed to live in comfort.<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nWith the help of the SS, the Arrow Cross leadership moved swiftly to take command of the Hungarian armed forces, and to prevent the surrender that Horthy had arranged, even though Soviet troops were now deep inside the country. Sz\u00e1lasi resumed persecution of Jews and other \"undesirables\". In the three months between November 1944 and January 1945, Arrow Cross death squads shot 10,000 to 15,000 Jews on the banks of the [[Danube]]. The Arrow Cross also welcomed Adolf Eichmann back to Budapest, where he began the deportation of the city's surviving Jews. Eichmann never successfully completed this phase of his plans, thwarted in large measure by the efforts of Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]]. Out of a pre-war Hungarian Jewish population estimated at 825,000, only 260,000 survived.\n\nBy December 1944, Budapest was under siege by Soviet forces. The Arrow Cross leadership retreated across the Danube into the hills of Buda in late January, and by February the city surrendered to the Soviet forces.\n\nHorthy remained under house arrest in Bavaria until the war in Europe ended. On 29 April, his SS guardians fled in the face of the Allied advance. On 1 May, Horthy was first liberated, and then arrested, by elements of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. 7th Army]].<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\n==Exile==\nAfter his arrest, Horthy was moved through a variety of detention locations before finally arriving at the prison facility at [[Nuremberg]] in late September 1945. There he was asked to provide evidence to the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in preparation for the trial of the Nazi leadership. Although he was interviewed repeatedly about his contacts with some of the defendants, he did not testify in person. In Nuremberg he was reunited with his son, Mikl\u00f3s.\n\nHorthy gradually came to believe that his arrest had been arranged and choreographed by the Americans in order to protect him from the Russians. Indeed, the former regent reported being told that [[Josip Broz Tito]], the new ruler of Yugoslavia, asked that Horthy be charged with complicity with the [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|1942 massacre of Serbian and Jewish civilians]] by Hungarian troops in the [[Ba\u010dka]] region of [[Vojvodina]].<ref name=\"horthy\"/> Serbian historian Zvonimir Golubovi\u0107 has claimed that not only was Horthy aware of these genocidal massacres, but had approved of them.<ref>Zvonimir Golubovi\u0107, Racija u Ju\u017enoj Ba\u010dkoj, 1942. godine, Novi Sad, 1991.

Nagy said that [[Joseph Stalin]] was more forgiving: that Stalin told Nagy during a diplomatic meeting in April 1945 not to judge Horthy, because he was old and had offered an armistice in 1944.<ref>Nagy's 1948 memoirs, ''The Struggle Behind the Iron Curtain'', are quoted in Andrew Simon's annotations to Horthy's ''Memoirs'', in this case for Chapter 22</ref>\n\nOn 17 December 1945, Horthy was released from Nuremberg prison and allowed to rejoin his family in the German town of [[Weilheim in Oberbayern|Weilheim]], [[Bavaria]]. The Horthys lived there for four years, supported financially by ambassador John Montgomery, his successor, [[Herbert Pell]], and by [[Pope Pius XII]], whom he knew personally.\n\nIn March 1948, Horthy returned to testify at the [[Ministries Trial]], the last of the twelve U.S.-run Nuremberg Trials; he testified against [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], the Nazi administrator who had controlled Hungary during the deportations to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"horthy\"/> Veesenmayer was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, but was released in 1951.\n\nFor Horthy, returning to Hungary was impossible; it was now firmly in the hands of a Soviet-sponsored Communist government. In an extraordinary twist of fate, the chief of Hungary's post-war Communist apparatus was [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], one of [[B\u00e9la Kun]]'s colleagues from the ill-fated Communist coup of 1919. Kun had been executed during Stalin's purges of the late 1930s, but R\u00e1kosi had survived in a Hungarian prison cell; in 1940 Horthy had permitted R\u00e1kosi to emigrate to the Soviet Union in exchange for a series of highly symbolic Hungarian battle-flags from the 19th century that were in Russian hands.\n\nIn 1950, the Horthy family managed to find a home in Portugal, thanks to Mikl\u00f3s Jr.'s contacts with Portuguese diplomats in Switzerland. Horthy and members of his family were relocated to the seaside town of [[Estoril]], in the house address Rua Dom Afonso Henriques, 1937 2765.573 Estoril.\nHis American supporter, John Montgomery, recruited a small group of wealthy Hungarians to raise funds for their upkeep in exile. According to Horthy's daughter-in-law, Countess Ilona Edelsheim Gyulai, Hungarian Jews also supported Horthy's family in exile,<ref name=\"Frank\"/> including industrialist Ferenc Chorin and lawyer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Pathy.<ref>From the [http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&bookid=9&post=1 ''Annotated Memoirs of Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy''] (accessed 2009 September 5).</ref>\n\nIn exile, Horthy wrote his memoirs, ''Ein Leben f\u00fcr Ungarn'' (English: ''A Life for Hungary''), published under the name of Nikolaus von Horthy, in which he narrated many personal experiences from his youth until the end of World War II. He claimed that he had distrusted Hitler for much of the time he knew him and tried to perform the best actions and appoint the best officials in his country. He also highlighted Hungary's mistreatment by many other countries since the end of World War I. Horthy was one of the few Axis heads of state to survive the war, and thus to write post-war memoirs.\n\n[[File:Kenderes Horthy csal\u00e1di s\u00edrbolt.jpg|thumb|The Horthy family crypt in Kenderes, where Horthy himself was reburied in 1993]]\nHorthy never lost his deep contempt for communism, and in his memoirs he blamed Hungary's alliance with the Axis on the threat posed by the \"Asiatic barbarians\" of the Soviet Union. He railed against the influence that the Allies' victory had given to Stalin's totalitarian state.  \"I feel no urge to say 'I told you so,' \" Horthy wrote, \"nor to express bitterness at the experiences that have been forced upon me. Rather, I feel wonder and amazement at the vagaries of humanity.\"<ref name=\"horthy\"/>\n\nHe died in 1957 in [[Estoril]].\n\nHorthy married [[Magdolna Purgly|Magdolna Purgly de J\u00f3sz\u00e1shely]] in 1901; they were married for just over 56 years, until his death. He had two sons, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Jr.]] (often rendered in English as \"Nicholas\" or \"Nikolaus\") and [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], who served as his political assistants; and two daughters, Magda and Paula. Of his four children, only Mikl\u00f3s outlived him.\n\nAccording to footnotes in his memoirs, Horthy was very distraught about the failure of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. In his will, Horthy asked that his body not be returned to Hungary \"until the last Russian soldier has left.\" His heirs honoured the request. In 1993, two years after the Soviet troops left Hungary, Horthy's body was returned to Hungary and he was buried in his home town of [[Kenderes]].

He learned that the Horthy regime was restorationist, fascist, fascistoid, half-fascist, dictatorial, militaristic, nationalist, selfish, exploitative, power-hungry, servile, and so on. And primarily: counterrevolutionary. Now he hears and reads: conservative, autocratic, authoritarian, undemocratic, patriotic, self-interested, dynamic, reformist, abandoned, deceived, etc. Now I think that here and now a new, considered synthesis has not yet seen the light of day, even if it has in most of the world.

Its legacy, and that of Horthy himself, remain among the most controversial political topics in Hungary today, tied inseparably to the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and the [[Holocaust]].  According to one school of thought, Horthy was a strong, conservative, but not undemocratic leader and patriot who only entered into an alliance with Hitler's Germany in order to restore lands Hungary lost after the First World War and was reluctant, or even defiant, in the face of Germany's demands to deport the Hungarian Jewry.<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> Others see Horthy's alliance with Germany as foolhardy,<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> or think that a positive view of Horthy serves a revisionist historical agenda,<ref>{{cite web|last1=LaCouter|first1=Travis|title=Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Addressing A Troubled Past|url=http://www.paprikapolitik.com/2012/07/miklos-horthy-addressing-a-troubled-past-2/|website=Paprika Politik|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> pointing to Horthy's passage of various anti-Jewish laws \u2013 the earliest in Europe, in 1920 \u2013 as a sign of his anti-Semitism and the prelude for the collaboration in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/>\n\nThe historiography and reception of Horthy has changed throughout the course of modern Hungarian history. He was officially denounced by the state during the communist era, while during his own time and in the 21st century, his reception has been more nuanced.\n\n===During the Horthy era===\n\nDuring his own reign, Horthy's reception was fairly positive, though by no means monolithic. Opponents of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet Republic]] saw him as a \"national saviour,\" in contrast to the communist \"losers of the nation.\"<ref name=\"Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Orsz\u00e1gment\u0151 6. oldal\">Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Orsz\u00e1gment\u0151 6. oldal</ref> Because Horthy distanced himself from everyday politics, he was able to cultivate the image of the nationally governing admiral. The peaceful re-acquisition of Hungarian-majority lands lost after Trianon greatly bolstered this image.<ref name=\"Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Hongyarap\u00edt\u00f3 10. oldal\">Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin/A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai/Hongyarap\u00edt\u00f3 10. oldal</ref> The regime's efforts at economic development and modernization also improved contemporaries' opinions, and although the Great Depression initially hurt his image, Horthy's wide-ranging social programs saved face for the most part.<ref name=\"Magyarorsz\u00e1g a XX. sz\u00e1zadban.

Bourgeois liberals, among them [[S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai]], criticized Horthy's authoritarian style as much as they disdained the violent tendencies of the far-left.<ref name=\"M\u00e1rai napl\u00f3\">M\u00e1rai S\u00e1ndor: Napl\u00f3 (1943\u20131944) 292. oldal; \u201eS a v\u00e9gs\u0151 felel\u0151ss\u00e9g m\u00e9gis Horthy\u00e9 \u00e9s emberei\u00e9, akik engedt\u00e9k n\u0151ni, teny\u00e9szni a szellemet, amelyb\u0151l mindez k\u00e9rlelhetetlen v\u00e9gzettel k\u00f6vetkezett.\"</ref> He was also criticized by monarchists and elements of the aristocracy and clergy.<ref name=\"Rubicon\">Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin: A Horthy-k\u00e9p v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sai</ref> While the harshest opposition to Horthy initially came from the communist parties he had overthrown and outlawed, the later 1930s saw him come under increasing criticism from the far-right. After the [[Arrow Cross]] took control of the country in 1945, Horthy was denounced as a \"traitor\" and \"Jew-lover\".\n\n[[File:Magyarorsz\u00e1g hat\u00e1rai 1920-1944.png|thumb|330px|left|Hungary's borders (in increasing color) in 1920, 1938, 1940 and 1941]]\nHorthy's reception in the West was positive until the outbreak of the Second World War, and while Hitler initially backed Horthy, relations between the two leaders were soured by Horthy's denial of involvement in the [[1939 invasion of Poland|invasions of Poland]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].

Scholars agree that due to political pressure, Horthy's positive achievements were unmentioned while his negative aspects were exaggerated to the point of total distortion.\n\nThe communist takeover in 1945 saw the same powers that had denounced Horthy as an \"executioner\" and a \"murdering monster\" assume control of the state. The government systematically disseminated, through propaganda and state education, the idea that the Horthy era constituted the \"lowest point in Hungarian history.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> Most of these views were supported by socialist or communist activists persecuted under the Horthy administration. Especially critical in this campaign was the 1950 publication of the textbook ''The Story of the Hungarian People'', which denounced Horthy's military as a \"genocidal band\" consisting of \"sociopathic officers, [[kulak]]s, and the dregs of society.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> It further characterized Horthy himself as a \"slave of the Habsburgs,\" a \"red-handed dictator\" who \"spoke broken Hungarian\" and was known for his \"hatred of workers and [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s.\"<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/> ''The Story of the Hungarian People'' was required reading in middle schools throughout the 1950s.<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/>\n\nThe situation only slowly improved. While the professionalization of Hungarian history and historiography coupled with the loosening of state ideological controls inevitably led to a fairer assessment of Horthy's life, popular volumes still painted him negatively. Influential biographies openly leveled ''ad hominem'' attacks at Horthy, accusing him of bastardy, lechery, sadism, greed, nepotism, bloodthirst, warmongering, and cowardice, among other vices.<ref name=\"Horthy-k\u00e9peink\"/>\n\n===Reburial and contemporary politics===\n[[File:Horthy Mikl\u00f3s \u00fajratemet\u00e9se - Kenderes, 1993.09.04 (4).jpg|thumb|Horthy's 4 September 1993 reburial in [[Kenderes]]. The government's open support of the ceremony incited protests and international attention]]\nThe transition to a [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|Western-style democracy]] allowed the privatization of media, which led to a shift in how Horthy was viewed in Hungary. In 1993, only a few years after the first democratic elections, Horthy's body was returned from Portugal to his hometown of [[Kenderes]]. Tens of thousands of people, as well as almost the entirety of [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]]'s [[Hungarian Democratic Forum|MDF]] cabinet, attended the ceremony. Antall had prefaced the burial with a series of interviews praising Horthy as a \"patriot.\"<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Perlez|first1=Jane|title=Reburial Is Both a Ceremony and a Test for Today's Hungary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/world/reburial-is-both-a-ceremony-and-a-test-for-today-s-hungary.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=The New York Times|date=5 September 1993}}</ref> The reburial was broadcast on state television and was accompanied by large-scale protests in Budapest.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/>\n\nIn contemporary Hungary, hagiography of Horthy is associated with the far-right [[Jobbik]] and its allies. Since 2012, Horthy statues, squares, or memorials have been erected in numerous villages and cities including [[Cs\u00f3kak\u0151]],<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> [[Kereki]], [[Gy\u00f6mr\u0151]], and [[Debrecen]].<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/> In November 2013, a Horthy statue's unveiling at a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church in Budapest drew international attention and criticism.<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/>\n\n''[[Der Spiegel]]'' has written about the resurgence of what its writers call \"the Horthy cult,\" claiming that Horthy's popularity indicates returning irredentist, reactionary, and ultranationalistic elements.<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/> Critics have more specifically connected Horthy's popularity to the ''[[Magyar G\u00e1rda]]'', a paramilitary group that uses [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]] imagery and to recent incidents of [[antiziganism|antiziganist]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] vandalism in Hungary.<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> The ruling [[Fidesz]] party has, according to reporters, \"hedged its bets\" on the Horthy controversy, refusing to outright condemn Horthy statues and other commemorations for fear of losing far-right voters to Jobbik, although some Fidesz politicians have labeled Horthy memorials \"provocative.\"<ref name=\"His contentious legacy\"/> This tension has led some to label Fidesz as \"implicitly anti-semitic\" and to accuse Prime Minister [[Viktor Orb\u00e1n]] of a \"revisionist\" agenda.<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/>\n\nLeft-wing groups such as the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] have condemned positive historiography of Horthy. [[Attila Mesterh\u00e1zy]], the socialist leader, has condemned the Orb\u00e1n government's position as \"inexcusable\", claiming that Fidesz was \"openly associating itself with the ideology of the regime that collaborated with the fascists.\"<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> Words have led to actions in some instances, for example when leftist activist P\u00e9ter D\u00e1niel vandalized a rural bust of Horthy by dousing it in red paint and hanging a sign that read \"Mass Murderer \u2013 War Criminal\" around its neck. Right-wing activists responded by vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]].<ref name=\"spiegel.de\"/>\n\nIn 2017, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Hungary, made a speech in which he called Horthy an \"exceptional statesman\" and gave him the credit for the survival of Hungary. The [[U.S. Holocaust Museum]] then issued a statement denouncing Orb\u00e1n and the Hungarian government for trying to \"rehabilitate the reputation of Hungary\u2019s wartime leader, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, who was a vocal anti-Semite and complicit in the murder of the country\u2019s Jewish population during the Holocaust.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Krupkin |first=Taly |url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-1.798471 |title=U.S. Holocaust museum denounces Hungarian PM for erasing wartime crimes \u2013 U.S. News |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television portrayals==\nIn the 1985 NBC TV film ''[[Wallenberg: A Hero's Story]]'', the role of Horthy was taken by Hungarian-born actor [[Guy Deghy]], who appeared bearded although Horthy (as photographs bore out) appeared consistently clean-shaven throughout his life.\n\nIn the 2011 Spanish TV film series, ''[[El \u00e1ngel de Budapest]]'' (The angel of Budapest), also set during Wallenberg's time in Hungary in 1944, he is portrayed by actor [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ag\u00e1rdi]]. In the 2014 American action drama film ''[[Walking with the Enemy]]'', Regent Horthy is portrayed by [[Ben Kingsley]].

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

A 1625 order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] refers to the Great Kirk congregation, which was then meeting in St Giles', as the \"High Kirk\".

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/the-national-covenant-of-scotland/|title=The National Covenant of Scotland|website=stgilescathedral.org.uk|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Thistle Chapel==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Interior.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel showing the ceiling and knights' stalls]]\n{{see|Thistle Chapel}}\n\nLocated at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]]; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

Gordon held on to the lead for the rest of the year.\n*This was the first race with the configuration erasing turns 4\u20136. A short chute was in place where the old hills were, making speeds much faster on the speed charts.\n*At the time this race was held no driver who had won at Sears Point went on to win the championship.

He seemed fine after the wreck, but at Watkins Glen the next weekend, he suffered fainting spells and had [[Larry Gunselman]] on standby, but did not take relief during the race.\n*On lap 77, [[Ward Burton]] cut a tire and hit the wall in turn 2, but the race stayed green for the next several laps. As Burton\u2019s car came to a stop on the warmup lane inside turn 3, drivers proceeded to make pit stops under green. With the caution still not yet out, leader [[Dale Jarrett]] began running out of gas exiting turn 1. After limping slowly around into the pits, Jarrett came to a stop just past the pit lane entrance. Jarrett's crew ran quickly toward the entrance of pit road to retrieve the car. After pushing the car about 1000 feet to the pit box, the team managed to refuel it and change four tires. The misadventure cost Jarrett 4 laps, but he would eventually finish in 16th place, last car on the lead lap.\n*This was the last race attempted by [[Precision Products Racing]].\n*The race also marked the return of Steve Park to Winston Cup action for the first time since suffering injuries in a practice crash in March at Atlanta.\n* [[Jeff Gordon]] had become the first driver to win the Brickyard 400 twice, and he won the No Bull 5 Million Dollar Bonus. Mark Martin and Bobby Labonte, finishing 2nd and 3rd respectively, were also No Bull 5 contenders. Dale Jarrett and Rusty Wallace were the other two contenders for the bonus.\n* This race ended under the caution flag, as due to a multi car accident with a couple laps to go, there were not enough laps to clean up the track and restart the race.\n\n=== [[The Bud at the Glen]] ===\n\n[[The Bud at the Glen]] was run on August 9 at [[Watkins Glen International]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York]].

Spencer only briefly practiced the car before the race.  Said had practiced and qualified the car in the 5th position (Since Spencer started the car that Said had qualified, Spencer had to start at the rear of the field).  After Said got in the car at lap 10, he began a drive up through the field.  A couple of spins within 10 laps of each other slowed Said's charge on his way to a 20th-place finish.\n*[[Dick Trickle]] was relieved during the race by [[Busch North]] and [[Featherlite Modified]] driver [[Ted Christopher]].  According to the [[ESPN]] telecast, this was because of Trickle's apparent lack of skill and confidence in his road racing abilities.  Christopher ran very well in the race before the engine blew late in the race, leaving Trickle (who got the drivers' points because he started the race) with a 41st-place finish.\n*[[Tom Hubert]] was hired by [[Elliott-Marino Racing]] to drive the No. 13 [[Ford]].  Hubert qualified 20th and drove up to 11th before having a slight off-course excursion.  The big hit came on the restart after the 2nd caution when the No. 33 of [[Ken Schrader]] ran up on the left rear of Hubert.  This peeled a good chunk of the left side sheetmetal off the car and spun it out.  The No. 23 and the No. 12 of [[Jeremy Mayfield]] also spun in this incident.  Mayfield got stuck in the gravel, prompting the third full course caution of the race.\n*[[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] had his best career finish (in this case, 3rd) for the second consecutive week.  This finish was achieved through a pit strategy that resulted in him attempting to go all the way on fuel from the last full course caution, a distance of 39 laps (95.55 miles).  After all the leaders had pitted, Skinner had a 25-second lead over [[Jeff Gordon]].  Skinner had to conserve fuel in order to make the finish, so he drove much slower than he would have.  Gordon, along with [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] and [[Rusty Wallace]] ran Skinner down with 3 laps to go.  Gordon and Martin were able to pass Skinner, but Wallace was not able to.\n*This race was the 4th consecutive race that [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] finished 2nd, and 3rd straight 2nd place finish to winner [[Jeff Gordon]], losing 30 points to him in the standings over the 3 races.\n*This was the last Cup race sponsored by a beer company.\n*[[Ron Fellows]] was the first [[Road course ringer|road ringer]] to qualify on the front row since [[Dan Gurney]] in 1970 at Riverside Raceway. In honor of his achievement, as well as the Canadian fans who watched the race, NASCAR, during pre-race ceremonies, had a singer recite the Canadian National Anthem along with the Star-Spangled Banner.\n*This race was held the day after Mark Martin's father, stepmother and half-sister were killed in a plane crash in Nevada.\n\n=== [[Pepsi 400 Presented by DeVilbiss]] ===\n\nThe [[Pepsi 400 Presented by DeVilbiss]] was run on August 16 in [[Brooklyn, Michigan]].

This would be also Gordon's last win until late October.\n*This was the fourth straight year in which Jeff Gordon would win the Southern 500. Not only is Jeff Gordon the only driver in NASCAR history to win 4 straight Southern 500 races, but he also the only driver in NASCAR history to win 4 straight races in one NASCAR Crown Jewel event. The 5 crown jewel events are Daytona 500, World 600, Brickyard 400, Southern 500, and Winston 500. His future teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] however, would almost accomplish that feat in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte. He would win 3 straight in 2003, 2004, and 2005. He would come so close on winning 4 straight Coca-Cola 600 races in 2006, but he would finish 2nd to another future teammate, [[Kasey Kahne]].\n*This was the 3rd consecutive year that Jeff Gordon won 10+ races in a season, a NASCAR modern era record. Gordon passed [[Darrell Waltrip]] for this feat after Darrell won 12 races each in back to back seasons of 1981 and 1982. [[Richard Petty]] holds the record for scoring 10 or more wins in 5 consecutive seasons. He scored 27 wins in 1967, 16 wins in 1968, 10 wins in 1969, 18 wins in 1970, & 21 wins in 1971, scoring a combined total of 92 wins.\n*This would be the last time until Gordon's future teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] in 2007 that a driver would win 10 races in a season.

In Victory Lane, Rudd had to be pulled out of the car and given first aid by paramedics.  [[Dr. Jerry Punch]], who conducted the Victory Lane interview, helped out the paramedics.\n*20th career win for Ricky Rudd. With this win, Ricky Rudd's winning streak would stay alive, making this the 16th straight season that he has won at least one race, 3rd all-time. [[Richard Petty]] leads the category by winning at least one race in 18 straight seasons (1960-1977, 185 wins), the most in NASCAR history.

It was designed to convince Rick that he could run well at road courses, typically the scenes of mediocre finishes, DNF's, and most notably, a spectacular wreck at Watkins Glen in 1993.  Previously, his best road course finish was 11th at Sears Point in 1992.\n*[[Jerry Nadeau]] got anxious on the start, having never been so close to the front previously in his [[Winston Cup]] career.  Starting on the outside pole, Nadeau tried to beat polesitter [[Jeff Gordon]] to Turn 2 (the first right turn on the course).  Unfortunately, he went into Turn 1a too fast and drove off course.  By the time he had fully recovered the car, he had dropped to 5th.  The off course excursion caused problems with Nadeau's brakes and tires to develop, which resulted in Nadeau crashing in the esses on lap 15, which put him out of the race with a 43rd (last) place finish.\n*[[Jeff Burton]] became the first [[Winston Cup]] driver ever to crash on the {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} long start-finish straight after contact with [[Dale Jarrett]] on lap 64.  This resulted in a 10 lap full course caution because the impact of Burton's car causing damage to the wall.\n*[[Lake Speed]] suffered rib and sternum injuries in a practice crash in Turn 10.  The injuries were serious enough for Speed to have to sit out the race. [[Winston West]] regular [[Butch Gilliland]] drove the No. 9 [[Ford]] to a 24th-place finish from 40th on the grid in place of Speed.\n*[[Jeff Gordon]] would take over the [[Winston Cup]] point lead after [[Jeremy Mayfield]] had troubles in this race.  Gordon held on to the lead for the rest of the year.\n*This was the first race with the configuration erasing turns 4\u20136. A short chute was in place where the old hills were, making speeds much faster on the speed charts.\n*At the time this race was held no driver who had won at Sears Point went on to win the championship. Race winner [[Jeff Gordon]] was the first to win both Sears Point and the championship later that year, earning his 3rd championship in 4 years.\n\n=== [[Jiffy Lube 300]] ===\n\nThe [[Jiffy Lube 300]] was run on July 12 in [[Loudon, New Hampshire]]. The No. 50 of [[Ricky Craven]] won the pole in his return to the No. 50 after missing the previous 13 races. This race was the last career start for [[Lake Speed]], who's aggravated rib and sternum injuries during the race leading to his retirement. Speed's original injuries came from a practice crash he suffered in the previous race at Sears Point.

This forced Spencer to seek relief from [[Boris Said]] the next weekend at Watkins Glen, and to sit out Bristol completely and have [[Ted Musgrave]] drive in his place.\n*[[Jeremy Mayfield]] crashed early in the race coming out of Turn 1.  He seemed fine after the wreck, but at Watkins Glen the next weekend, he suffered fainting spells and had [[Larry Gunselman]] on standby, but did not take relief during the race.\n*On lap 77, [[Ward Burton]] cut a tire and hit the wall in turn 2, but the race stayed green for the next several laps. As Burton\u2019s car came to a stop on the warmup lane inside turn 3, drivers proceeded to make pit stops under green. With the caution still not yet out, leader [[Dale Jarrett]] began running out of gas exiting turn 1. After limping slowly around into the pits, Jarrett came to a stop just past the pit lane entrance. Jarrett's crew ran quickly toward the entrance of pit road to retrieve the car. After pushing the car about 1000 feet to the pit box, the team managed to refuel it and change four tires. The misadventure cost Jarrett 4 laps, but he would eventually finish in 16th place, last car on the lead lap.\n*This was the last race attempted by [[Precision Products Racing]].\n*The race also marked the return of Steve Park to Winston Cup action for the first time since suffering injuries in a practice crash in March at Atlanta.\n* [[Jeff Gordon]] had become the first driver to win the Brickyard 400 twice, and he won the No Bull 5 Million Dollar Bonus. Mark Martin and Bobby Labonte, finishing 2nd and 3rd respectively, were also No Bull 5 contenders. Dale Jarrett and Rusty Wallace were the other two contenders for the bonus.\n* This race ended under the caution flag, as due to a multi car accident with a couple laps to go, there were not enough laps to clean up the track and restart the race.\n\n=== [[The Bud at the Glen]] ===\n\n[[The Bud at the Glen]] was run on August 9 at [[Watkins Glen International]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York]]. [[Jeff Gordon]] won the pole.

Spencer only briefly practiced the car before the race.  Said had practiced and qualified the car in the 5th position (Since Spencer started the car that Said had qualified, Spencer had to start at the rear of the field).  After Said got in the car at lap 10, he began a drive up through the field.  A couple of spins within 10 laps of each other slowed Said's charge on his way to a 20th-place finish.\n*[[Dick Trickle]] was relieved during the race by [[Busch North]] and [[Featherlite Modified]] driver [[Ted Christopher]].  According to the [[ESPN]] telecast, this was because of Trickle's apparent lack of skill and confidence in his road racing abilities.  Christopher ran very well in the race before the engine blew late in the race, leaving Trickle (who got the drivers' points because he started the race) with a 41st-place finish.\n*[[Tom Hubert]] was hired by [[Elliott-Marino Racing]] to drive the No. 13 [[Ford]].  Hubert qualified 20th and drove up to 11th before having a slight off-course excursion.  The big hit came on the restart after the 2nd caution when the No. 33 of [[Ken Schrader]] ran up on the left rear of Hubert.  This peeled a good chunk of the left side sheetmetal off the car and spun it out.  The No. 23 and the No. 12 of [[Jeremy Mayfield]] also spun in this incident.  Mayfield got stuck in the gravel, prompting the third full course caution of the race.\n*[[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] had his best career finish (in this case, 3rd) for the second consecutive week.  This finish was achieved through a pit strategy that resulted in him attempting to go all the way on fuel from the last full course caution, a distance of 39 laps (95.55 miles).  After all the leaders had pitted, Skinner had a 25-second lead over [[Jeff Gordon]].  Skinner had to conserve fuel in order to make the finish, so he drove much slower than he would have.  Gordon, along with [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] and [[Rusty Wallace]] ran Skinner down with 3 laps to go.  Gordon and Martin were able to pass Skinner, but Wallace was not able to.\n*This race was the 4th consecutive race that [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] finished 2nd, and 3rd straight 2nd place finish to winner [[Jeff Gordon]], losing 30 points to him in the standings over the 3 races.\n*This was the last Cup race sponsored by a beer company.\n*[[Ron Fellows]] was the first [[Road course ringer|road ringer]] to qualify on the front row since [[Dan Gurney]] in 1970 at Riverside Raceway. In honor of his achievement, as well as the Canadian fans who watched the race, NASCAR, during pre-race ceremonies, had a singer recite the Canadian National Anthem along with the Star-Spangled Banner.\n*This race was held the day after Mark Martin's father, stepmother and half-sister were killed in a plane crash in Nevada.\n\n=== [[Pepsi 400 Presented by DeVilbiss]] ===\n\nThe [[Pepsi 400 Presented by DeVilbiss]] was run on August 16 in [[Brooklyn, Michigan]].

[[Jack Roush]], owner of the 6, 16, 26, 97, and 99 cars driven by Mark Martin, [[Ted Musgrave]]/[[Kevin Lepage]], [[Johnny Benson, Jr.|Johnny Benson]], [[Chad Little]], and Jeff Burton, respectively, accused Gordon and his team of cheating by applying chemical solvents to their tires. [[NASCAR]] officials began an investigation by sealing off Gordon's pit stall and confiscating several sets of tires for testing.

[[Jeff Gordon]] won the last such race, making him eligible to win a million dollars in this race if he pulled off a win.\n*This was Jeff Gordon's 7th win in the last 9 races. This would be also Gordon's last win until late October.\n*This was the fourth straight year in which Jeff Gordon would win the Southern 500. Not only is Jeff Gordon the only driver in NASCAR history to win 4 straight Southern 500 races, but he also the only driver in NASCAR history to win 4 straight races in one NASCAR Crown Jewel event. The 5 crown jewel events are Daytona 500, World 600, Brickyard 400, Southern 500, and Winston 500. His future teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] however, would almost accomplish that feat in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte. He would win 3 straight in 2003, 2004, and 2005. He would come so close on winning 4 straight Coca-Cola 600 races in 2006, but he would finish 2nd to another future teammate, [[Kasey Kahne]].\n*This was the 3rd consecutive year that Jeff Gordon won 10+ races in a season, a NASCAR modern era record. Gordon passed [[Darrell Waltrip]] for this feat after Darrell won 12 races each in back to back seasons of 1981 and 1982. [[Richard Petty]] holds the record for scoring 10 or more wins in 5 consecutive seasons. He scored 27 wins in 1967, 16 wins in 1968, 10 wins in 1969, 18 wins in 1970, & 21 wins in 1971, scoring a combined total of 92 wins.\n*This would be the last time until Gordon's future teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] in 2007 that a driver would win 10 races in a season.

This resulted in Rudd being broiled inside of the car.  [[Hut Stricklin]] was on standby to relieve Rudd, but Rudd never got out of the car.  In Victory Lane, Rudd had to be pulled out of the car and given first aid by paramedics.  [[Dr. Jerry Punch]], who conducted the Victory Lane interview, helped out the paramedics.\n*20th career win for Ricky Rudd. With this win, Ricky Rudd's winning streak would stay alive, making this the 16th straight season that he has won at least one race, 3rd all-time. [[Richard Petty]] leads the category by winning at least one race in 18 straight seasons (1960-1977, 185 wins), the most in NASCAR history.
