He lived in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] for much of his life where he was known for his love of [[Colorado]]. In 1974, Denver was named [[poet laureate]] of the state.

Because Denver's father was in the military and his family moved often, it was difficult for him to make friends and fit in with other children of his own age. Constantly being the new kid was troubling for the introverted Denver, and he grew up always feeling as though he should be somewhere else, but never knowing where that \"right\" place was.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=John Denver | date=October 14, 1997}}</ref> While the family was stationed at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Denver was a member of the [[Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus]] for two years. Denver was happy living in Tucson, but his father was then transferred to [[Maxwell AFB]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], then in the midst of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|Montgomery boycotts]]. The family later moved to [[Carswell AFB]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver was raised and graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Fort Worth was a distressing experience for Denver, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father's car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. However, his father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708100625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=John Denver |via=Find Articles |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAt the age of 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother.<ref name=\"bio\"/> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college.

In 1965, Denver joined [[The Chad Mitchell Trio|the Mitchell Trio]], replacing founder Chad Mitchell. After more personnel changes, the trio later became known as \"Denver, Boise, and Johnson\" (John Denver, David Boise, and [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]]).<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nIn 1969, Denver abandoned the band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for [[RCA Records]], ''[[Rhymes & Reasons (John Denver album)|Rhymes & Reasons]]''. Two years prior, Denver had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. He included in the demo a song he had written called \"Babe, I Hate to Go\", later renamed \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\". Denver made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas.<ref>[http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html Current Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205131958/http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html |date=December 5, 2010 }}</ref> Producer [[Milt Okun]], who produced records for the Mitchell Trio and the high-profile folk group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], had become Denver's producer as well.

When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or local coffee house to let him play, he distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref> With his foot in the door as writer of \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\", he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues let him play for the \"door\"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, however, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract. He had also built a sizable and solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://johndenver.com/about/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=johndenver.com |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDenver recorded two more albums in 1970, ''[[Take Me to Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Whose Garden Was This]]'', including a mix of songs he had written and cover versions of other artists' compositions.\n\n===Career peak===\nHis next album, ''[[Poems, Prayers, and Promises]]'' (released in 1971), was a breakthrough for him in the U.S., thanks in part to the single \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\", which went to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with ''[[Rocky Mountain High (album)|Rocky Mountain High]]'', with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1973-02-17/hot-100 |title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs & The Hot 100 |work=Billboard  |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> In 1974 and 1975, Denver experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four No.&nbsp;1 songs (\"[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]\", \"[[Annie's Song]]\", \"[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]\", and \"[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]\") and three No.&nbsp;1 albums (''[[John Denver's Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Back Home Again (John Denver album)|Back Home Again]]'', and ''[[Windsong]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |title=Artist Biography \u2013 John Denver |publisher=Countrypolitan.com |date=October 12, 1997 |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221215317/http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |archivedate=February 21, 2001  }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Denver's onstage appearance included long blond hair and \"granny\" glasses. His embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer & appliqu\u00e9 artist Anna Zapp. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, \"I've had no success in Britain...I mean ''none''\".<ref>''John Denver: Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M.

He also tried acting, appearing in \"The Colorado Cattle Caper\" episode of the ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' television movie in February 1974. He starred in the 1977 film ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' opposite [[George Burns]]. Denver hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on multiple occasions.\nIn 1975, Denver was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award.

Denver's music was defended by country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who told Alanna Nash of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', \"A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way...People forget how huge he was worldwide\".\n\nIn 1977, Denver co-founded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. Denver was also appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger, writing the song \"I Want to Live\" as its theme song. In 1979, Denver performed \"Rhymes & Reasons\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song \"[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]],\" which is an ode to [[Calypso (ship)|the eponymous exploration ship]] which was used by environmental activist [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1976, he campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976, to promote [[sustainable living]]. His dismay at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.<ref name=\"bio2\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Denver was critical of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], but he remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987.<ref name=\"bio2\"/> Denver's criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad \"Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)\". In an open letter to the media, he wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Denver had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which he wrote in the midst of the 1996 presidential election, was one of the last he ever wrote.<ref name=\"bio2\"/> Denver was also on the Board of Governors of the [[National Space Society]] for many years.\n\n===Later years and humanitarian work===\nDenver had a few more U.S. Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and [[sustainability]] causes, focusing extensively on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed \"What One Man Can Do\") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. He also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). Denver had a keen interest in solutions to [[world hunger]]. He visited Africa during the 1980s to witness first-hand the suffering caused by starvation and to work with African leaders toward solutions.\n\nFrom 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the yearly fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp's annual operating budget.<ref name=\"barb1\">{{cite news |last1=Isenberg |first1=Barbara |title=Aspen Takes a Mellow Stance Towards John Denver's Gas Tank |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/493749518/? |accessdate=December 18, 2018 |work=The Record |agency=Los Angeles Times News Service |date=August 20, 1979}}</ref> During the Aspen Valley Hospital's $1.7&nbsp;million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.<ref name=\"barb1\"/>\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual [[Grammy Award]]s.

Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator, as skiing was another of his enthusiasms. He had written and composed \"The Gold and Beyond\", and he sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.<ref name=\"JD\"/>\n\nIn 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of \"[[We Are the World]],\" but he was turned down. According to [[Ken Kragen]] (who helped to produce the song), the reason Denver was turned down was that many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. \"I didn't agree\" with this assessment, Kragen said, but he reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/behind.htm |title=Harry Chapin  |publisher=Harrychapin.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:John Denver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denver at the 1995 [[National Memorial Day Concert]]]]\nFor Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental TV program, ''In Partnership With Earth,'' with then\u2013[[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[William K. Reilly]].\n\nDue to his love of flying, he was attracted to [[NASA]] and became dedicated to America's work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the \"Citizens in Space\" program.

The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The selector valve handle had been intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs. The builder instead had placed it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nBefore the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle, using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]]. However, this did not solve the problem and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nThe mechanic said he remarked to Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was \"less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank\". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nThe NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> Four witnesses stated the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four of them saying the bank was to the right (north). Twelve witnesses described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude at between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said that they heard a \"pop\" or \"backfire\", accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the airplane crashed into the sea.\n\nIn addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined there were other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to locate the fuel selector handle in a difficult-to-reach location.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating experimental aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\n[[File:JohnDenverMemorialPacificGrove.JPG|thumb|The plaque marking the location of Denver's plane crash in [[Pacific Grove, California]]]]\nUpon announcement of Denver's death, Colorado governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor.

Because Denver's father was in the military and his family moved often, it was difficult for him to make friends and fit in with other children of his own age. Constantly being the new kid was troubling for the introverted Denver, and he grew up always feeling as though he should be somewhere else, but never knowing where that \"right\" place was.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=John Denver | date=October 14, 1997}}</ref> While the family was stationed at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Denver was a member of the [[Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus]] for two years. Denver was happy living in Tucson, but his father was then transferred to [[Maxwell AFB]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], then in the midst of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|Montgomery boycotts]]. The family later moved to [[Carswell AFB]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver was raised and graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Fort Worth was a distressing experience for Denver, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father's car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. However, his father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708100625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=John Denver |via=Find Articles |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAt the age of 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother.<ref name=\"bio\"/> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college.

Two years prior, Denver had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts.

When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or local coffee house to let him play, he distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref> With his foot in the door as writer of \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\", he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues let him play for the \"door\"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, however, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract.

Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years.

His embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer & appliqu\u00e9 artist Anna Zapp. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, \"I've had no success in Britain...I mean ''none''\".<ref>''John Denver: Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M.

He also tried acting, appearing in \"The Colorado Cattle Caper\" episode of the ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' television movie in February 1974. He starred in the 1977 film ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' opposite [[George Burns]]. Denver hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on multiple occasions.\nIn 1975, Denver was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award.

Denver's music was defended by country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who told Alanna Nash of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', \"A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way...People forget how huge he was worldwide\".\n\nIn 1977, Denver co-founded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. Denver was also appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger, writing the song \"I Want to Live\" as its theme song. In 1979, Denver performed \"Rhymes & Reasons\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song \"[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]],\" which is an ode to [[Calypso (ship)|the eponymous exploration ship]] which was used by environmental activist [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1976, he campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976, to promote [[sustainable living]]. His dismay at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.<ref name=\"bio2\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Denver was critical of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], but he remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987.<ref name=\"bio2\"/> Denver's criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad \"Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)\". In an open letter to the media, he wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Denver had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which he wrote in the midst of the 1996 presidential election, was one of the last he ever wrote.<ref name=\"bio2\"/> Denver was also on the Board of Governors of the [[National Space Society]] for many years.\n\n===Later years and humanitarian work===\nDenver had a few more U.S. Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and [[sustainability]] causes, focusing extensively on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed \"What One Man Can Do\") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. He also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). Denver had a keen interest in solutions to [[world hunger]]. He visited Africa during the 1980s to witness first-hand the suffering caused by starvation and to work with African leaders toward solutions.\n\nFrom 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the yearly fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp's annual operating budget.<ref name=\"barb1\">{{cite news |last1=Isenberg |first1=Barbara |title=Aspen Takes a Mellow Stance Towards John Denver's Gas Tank |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/493749518/? |accessdate=December 18, 2018 |work=The Record |agency=Los Angeles Times News Service |date=August 20, 1979}}</ref> During the Aspen Valley Hospital's $1.7&nbsp;million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.<ref name=\"barb1\"/>\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual [[Grammy Award]]s.

Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator, as skiing was another of his enthusiasms. He had written and composed \"The Gold and Beyond\", and he sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.<ref name=\"JD\"/>\n\nIn 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of \"[[We Are the World]],\" but he was turned down. According to [[Ken Kragen]] (who helped to produce the song), the reason Denver was turned down was that many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. \"I didn't agree\" with this assessment, Kragen said, but he reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/behind.htm |title=Harry Chapin  |publisher=Harrychapin.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:John Denver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denver at the 1995 [[National Memorial Day Concert]]]]\nFor Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental TV program, ''In Partnership With Earth,'' with then\u2013[[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[William K.

He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the \"Citizens in Space\" program. Denver received the [[NASA Public Service Medal]], in 1985 for \"helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world\", an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. Also, in 1985, Denver passed NASA's rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen's trip on the Space Shuttle in 1986, but he was not chosen. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] with teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]] aboard, Denver dedicated his song \"Flying for Me\" to all astronauts, and he continued to support NASA.<ref name=\"JD\"/>\n\nDenver testified before the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee on the topic of censorship during a [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearing in 1985.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deflem |first1=Mathieu |title=Popular Culture and Social Control: The Moral Panic on Music Labeling |journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice |volume=45(1):2-24|date=2020 |doi=10.1007/s12103-019-09495-3 }}</ref> Contrary to his innocuous public image as a musician, Denver openly stood with more controversial witnesses like [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dee Snider]] of the [[Heavy Metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Twisted Sister]] in opposing the PMRC's objectives.

The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The selector valve handle had been intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs. The builder instead had placed it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nBefore the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle, using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]]. However, this did not solve the problem and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nThe mechanic said he remarked to Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was \"less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank\". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/>\n\nThe NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> Four witnesses stated the aircraft was originally heading west.

Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude at between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said that they heard a \"pop\" or \"backfire\", accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the airplane crashed into the sea.\n\nIn addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined there were other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to locate the fuel selector handle in a difficult-to-reach location.<ref name=\"AVW\"/><ref name=\"NTSB\"/> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating experimental aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\n[[File:JohnDenverMemorialPacificGrove.JPG|thumb|The plaque marking the location of Denver's plane crash in [[Pacific Grove, California]]]]\nUpon announcement of Denver's death, Colorado governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor.

The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved (by Jeffrey Pine of Colorado) with the singer's name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially, the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of the singer's family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a [[bas-relief]] of the singer's face and lines from his song \"Windsong\": \"So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers.

She approached [[soil management]] in a way designed to work naturally with the farm's environment, which was particularly important in Brazil. According to her research, the most appropriate type of agriculture there would encourage farmers to favor treating the soil so it has high levels of organic matter, avoids movement, controls pests using biological techniques, and avoids chemical inputs by substituting organic additives such as [[green manure]]. She called her methods [[agroecology]]. <ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn a 2016 interview,<ref name=\":2\" /> she explained one aspect of tropical soils:<blockquote>\"In the tropics, 80% of microorganisms found in the soil are fungi that produce enormous amounts of antibiotics and have their life inhibited below 15 centimeters. In the past, when farmers worked with an ox or donkey plow, the plow did not go below 12 or 15 cm and the land remained more or less in the superficial part. Now with the mechanical traction plow, you can reach 30 or 40 cm, put the dead part on top that is broken up by the rain, enters the ground and clogs the pores. There the land is hard, compacted. Everyone asks me what to do with compaction. In the tropics, you cannot work the land deeply at all. The work has to be superficial because the ground below is dead.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\n\n=== Life in Brazil ===\nAna and her husband were professors at the [[Federal University of Santa Maria|Federal University of Santa Mar\u00eda]], in the southern-most state of Brazil. There, she helped organize the first postgraduate course in organic agriculture. She was also the founder of the Organic Agriculture Association (AAO), one of the first associations of organic producers in Brazil.  \n\nHer book ''\"Ecological management alone: \u200b\u200bagriculture in tropical regions\"'' is still considered a [[reference work]] in [[Agricultural science|agricultural sciences]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.leisa-al.org/web/index.php/statistics/volumen-24-numero-2/1879-ana-primavesi-la-profesora-de-todos-nosotros|title=Ana Primavesi: la profesora de todos nosotros|website=www.leisa-al.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>  \n\nAfter she retired from teaching, she and her husband moved to their own property in [[Ita\u00ed]], located in the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo. After her husband's death in 1977, she stayed there to put into practice her research about organic agriculture. She lived on the farm for more than 30 years and authored multiple publications about her research and agriculture work.

She approached [[soil management]] in a way designed to work naturally with the farm's environment, which was particularly important in Brazil. According to her research, the most appropriate type of agriculture there would encourage farmers to favor treating the soil so it has high levels of organic matter, avoids movement, controls pests using biological techniques, and avoids chemical inputs by substituting organic additives such as [[green manure]]. She called her methods [[agroecology]]. <ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn a 2016 interview,<ref name=\":2\" /> she explained one aspect of tropical soils:<blockquote>\"In the tropics, 80% of microorganisms found in the soil are fungi that produce enormous amounts of antibiotics and have their life inhibited below 15 centimeters. In the past, when farmers worked with an ox or donkey plow, the plow did not go below 12 or 15 cm and the land remained more or less in the superficial part. Now with the mechanical traction plow, you can reach 30 or 40 cm, put the dead part on top that is broken up by the rain, enters the ground and clogs the pores. There the land is hard, compacted. Everyone asks me what to do with compaction. In the tropics you cannot work the land deeply at all. The work has to be superficial because the ground below is dead.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\n\n=== Life in Brazil ===\nAna and her husband were professors at the [[Federal University of Santa Maria|Federal University of Santa Mar\u00eda]], in the southern-most state of Brazil. There, she helped organize the first postgraduate course in organic agriculture. She was also the founder of the Organic Agriculture Association (AAO), one of the first associations of organic producers in Brazil.  \n\nHer book ''\"Ecological management alone: \u200b\u200bagriculture in tropical regions\"'' is still considered a [[reference work]] in [[Agricultural science|agricultural sciences]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.leisa-al.org/web/index.php/statistics/volumen-24-numero-2/1879-ana-primavesi-la-profesora-de-todos-nosotros|title=Ana Primavesi: la profesora de todos nosotros|website=www.leisa-al.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>  \n\nAfter she retired from teaching, she and her husband moved to their own property in [[Ita\u00ed]], located in the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo. After her husband's death in 1977, she stayed there to put into practice her research about organic agriculture. She lived on the farm for more than 30 years and authored multiple publications about her research and agriculture work. Under Primavesi's management, her land, which was badly eroded when bought, was rejuvenated with springs, forests and agricultural areas.

During this time, he discovered his calling as a missionary; he entered the Foreign Missions Seminary (S\u00e9minaire des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res) in Paris in 1885. He would spend only a year there before he was posted to the mission in [[Pondicherry]], India.<ref name=ME/>\n\nAfter announcing his posting, he went to say his farewells to his family members. They were filled with grief when he announced he was leaving forever; coming from Father Paillot, it was an irrevocable decision. He stayed true to his words as the 44 years between his departure from France and his death were all spent in India. The first years of his mandate were difficult, as he lost both a brother and his mother.<ref name=annales/>\n\n==Life in India==\nHe arrived in Pondicherry in 1886. He was named the vicar of the [[Our Lady of Angels Church, Puducherry|Our Lady of Angels Church]] in July 1887. He was temporarily assigned to the Colonial College in 1894 while its director returned to France due to health concerns; when the director returned in 1885, Father Paillot returned to Our Lady of Angels. However, he developed malarial fever, which put his life in danger, necessitating a change in climate.<ref name=ME/>\n \nHe was sent to the mountains of [[Ceylon]]. Working in Kandy as secretary for Mgr. Zaleski, the apostolic delegate in India, his health slowly returned. As he got better, he followed the Monsignor to his various apostolic wanderings in India for about a year. He returned to Pondicherry in 1926, again serving as vicar at Our Lady of Angels. When the parish priest retired, he took over the position; \u201cIn spite of his 71 years, he was the good shepherd, catechising, preaching, going to visit his parishioners, bringing comfort to the sick, offering himself fully to all, to win them for [[Jesus Christ]].\u201d <ref name=ME/>\n\n==Final years==\nStarting in 1929, his health began to decline.

During this time, he discovered his calling as a missionary; he entered the Foreign Missions Seminary (S\u00e9minaire des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res) in Paris in 1885. He would spend only a year there before he was posted to the mission in Pondicherry, India.<ref name=ME/>\n\nAfter announcing his posting, he went to say his farewells to his family members. They were filled with grief when he announced he was leaving forever; coming from Father Paillot, it was an irrevocable decision. He stayed true to his words as the 44 years between his departure from France and his death were all spent in India. The first years of his mandate were difficult, he lost both a brother and his mother.<ref name=annales/>\n\n==Life in India==\nHe arrived in Pondicherry in 1886. He was named the vicar of the [[Our Lady of Angels Church, Puducherry|Our Lady of Angels Church]] in July 1887. He was temporarily assigned to the Colonial College in 1894 while its director returned to France due to health concerns; when the director returned in 1885, Father Paillot returned to Our Lady of Angels. However, he developed malarial fever, which put his life in danger, necessitating a change in climate.<ref name=ME/>\n \nHe was sent to the mountains of [[Ceylon]]. Working in Kandy as secretary for Mgr. Zaleski, the apostolic delegate in India, his health slowly returned. As he got better, he followed the Monsignor to his various apostolic wanderings in India for about a year. He returned to Pondicherry in 1926, again serving as vicar at Our Lady of Angels. When the parish priest retired, he took over the position; \u201cIn spite of his 71 years, he was the good shepherd, catechising, preaching, going to visit his parishioners, bringing comfort to the sick, offering himself fully to all, to win them for [[Jesus Christ]].\u201d <ref name=ME/>\n\n==Final years==\nStarting in 1929, his health began to decline.

Today's Uppsala was then called ''\u00d6stra Aros'' (Eastern Aros, to differentiate it from [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s|Western Aros]]). (Old) Uppsala was, according to medieval writer [[Adam of Bremen]], the main [[paganism|pagan]] centre of Sweden, and the [[Temple at Uppsala]] contained magnificent idols of the [[\u00c6sir|Norse gods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm#descrip |title=Descriptio Insularum Aquilonis |page=26 |language=latin |author=Adam of Bremen |date=11th century |accessdate=15 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207105412/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm#descrip |archivedate=7 February 2005 |df=dmy-all |author-link=Adam of Bremen }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/adamafbrem/0234.htm |title=Adam af Bremen om Menigheden i Norden under Erkes\u00e6det i Bremen og Hamborg (788\u20131072) |page=194 |language=danish |author=P.

In 1160, King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric Jedvardsson]] was attacked and killed outside the church of \u00d6stra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1274, \u00d6stra Aros overtook [[Gamla Uppsala]] as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to \u00d6stra Aros, where the present-day [[Uppsala Cathedral]] was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching {{convert|118.70|m}}.\n\nThe city is the site of the oldest university in [[Scandinavia]], founded in 1477, and is where [[Carl Linnaeus]], one of the renowned scholars of [[Uppsala University]], lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century [[Uppsala Castle]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608163154/http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |archive-date=8 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> {{anchor|1702 fire}}The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702. Historical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the [[Coat of Arms of Sweden]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Buss i Stora Torget, Uppsala.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stora Torget (town square): The building in the background is the Nordbankshuset.]]\nSituated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River ([[Fyris\u00e5n]]) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the [[Esker|glacial ridge]] of Uppsala\u00e5sen at an elevation around {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the site of Uppsala's castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park ''Stadsskogen'' (literally \"City Forest\") stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.\n\nOnly some {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]] takes only 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air.\n\nThe commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct [[town and gown]] divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the [[Fj\u00e4rdingen]] neighbourhood on the river's western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed until today. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place.\n\n=== Climate ===\nUppsala lies immediately south of the [[60th parallel north]] and has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold winters and warm summers. Due to its northerly location, Uppsala experiences over 18 hours of visible sunshine during the [[summer solstice]], and under 6 hours of sunshine during the [[winter solstice]].  Despite Uppsala's northerly location, the winter is not as cold as other cities at similar latitudes, mainly due to the [[Gulf Stream]]. For example, in January Uppsala has a daily mean of \u22122.7&nbsp;\u00b0C (27.1&nbsp;\u00b0F). In [[Canada]], at the same latitude, [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] experiences a daily mean of \u221222.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u22128.3&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Climate chart\n| Uppsala, Sweden\n| \u22125.6 | -0.3 | 39\n| \u22126.2 | 0.1 | 30\n| \u22123.3 | 3.8 | 33\n| 0.4 | 10.1 | 32\n| 5.1 | 16.4 | 39\n| 9.4 | 19.8 | 61\n| 12.5 | 22.7 | 65\n| 11.5 | 21.2 | 74\n| 7.3 | 15.9 | 52\n| 3.3 | 9.7 | 53\n| \u22120.8 | 4.0 | 53\n| \u22124.4 | 0.7 | 46\n|float = left\n|clear = none\n|source = http://celsius.met.uu.se/default.aspx?pageid=24 | celsius.met.uu.se }}\n\nWith respect to record temperatures, the difference between the highest and lowest is relatively large. Uppsala\u2019s highest recorded temperature was {{convert|37.4|C|F|1}}, recorded in July 1933.<ref>http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/temperaturrekord-i-stockholm-och-uppsala-1.4735</ref> On the same day [[Ultuna]], which lies a few kilometres south of the centre of Uppsala, recorded a temperature of {{convert|38|C|F|1}}. This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], although the same temperature was recorded in [[M\u00e5lilla]], Sweden, 14 years later. Uppsala\u2019s lowest temperature was recorded in January 1875, when the temperature dropped to {{convert|-39.5|C|F|1}}. The second-lowest temperature recorded is {{convert|-33.1|C|F|1}}, which makes the record one of the hardest to beat, due to the fact that temperatures in Uppsala nowadays rarely goes below {{convert|-30|C|F|0}}. The difference between the two records is {{convert|76.9|C-change|1}}.\n\nThe warmest month ever recorded is July 2018, with a daily mean of 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (70.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since 2002 Uppsala has experienced 6 months where the daily mean was 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) or warmer, the most recent in July 2018 when the daily mean was 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (68.9&nbsp;\u00b0F). The coldest month ever recorded is January 1814, when the daily mean was \u221214.9&nbsp;\u00b0C (5.2&nbsp;\u00b0F). Between January 1814 and January 1987, Uppsala experienced 23 months that were colder than \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C (14&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since February 1987, the coldest month recorded is \u22128.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (16.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). The warmest year ever recorded was 2014, with an average temperature of 8.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The second warmest is 2018, with 8.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (46&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since 1991, Uppsala has recorded 15 years with an average temperature of 7&nbsp;\u00b0C (44.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) or warmer. The coldest year ever recorded was 1867, with an average temperature of 2.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (36.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). 1987 was the last year Uppsala recorded a year with an average temperature below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C (41&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe climate table below presents weather data from 1981\u20132010. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during  1981\u20132010 as compared with the 1951\u20131980 series. This increase is on an annual basis around 0.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Warming is most pronounced during the winter and spring. January, February, and March have had the most pronouncing increase in temperature, with each month increasing 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or more. The only month that did not get warmer is June, which got 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C colder. During the 20th century, Uppsala has warmed drastically, especially the winter. If compared to the period 1861\u20131890, the annual increase in temperature is 1.8&nbsp;\u00b0C. March is the month with the biggest increase, where the temperature has increased more than 3&nbsp;\u00b0C since the latter parts of the 19th century.\n\nWinter normally arrives in late November, and lasts until the middle of March when spring arrives. Summer usually arrives in the middle of May, and lasts until late September when autumn arrives.<ref>http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/arstider-1.1082</ref> Precipitation is most common between June and November, in all these months it falls 50&nbsp;mm (2.0&nbsp;in) or more on average. August receives most precipitation with 74&nbsp;mm (2.9&nbsp;in). Between January and May precipitation levels fall a bit, with all months receiving less than 40&nbsp;mm (1.6&nbsp;in) on average. Annual precipitation is 576&nbsp;mm (22.6&nbsp;in). Rainfall can occur all year round, although it is less common in January and February. Snowfall mainly occurs between November and March. Snowfall in October and April can happen from time to time, but not every year. During the night between 30 April and 1 May 2014 it fell approximately 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) of snow in Uppsala, the first recorded snowfall in May since 1981.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location =

Founded in 1477, under bishop [[Jakob Ulvsson]]. Originally a Catholic institution, after limited activity following the [[Reformation]] it was re-organised as a Lutheran institution in 1595, following the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593. The university has a famous [[anatomical theatre]], constructed by the scientist and [[polymath]] [[Olof Rudbeck]] (1630\u20131702), in the old university building [[Gustavianum]]. The building is now a museum. The university has 13 student fraternities, known as \"nations\", each traditionally representing a geographical region of Sweden.\n*[[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] (SLU, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, main campus).\n\n=== Other higher education ===\n* [[Johannelunds Teologiska H\u00f6gskola]]. A Lutheran theological seminary established in 1862, located in Uppsala since 1970.\n* The [[Newman Institute (Uppsala)|Newman Institute]]. A Catholic institution founded in 2001.\n* [[Pingstr\u00f6relsens teologiska seminarium]]. A Pentecostal theological seminary, which does not have [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] from the Swedish [[National Agency for Higher Education]] and cannot confer Swedish academic degrees.\n\n== Museums and sights ==\n[[File:Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, Uppsala II.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Uppsala)|The Botanical Garden]] at Uppsala Castle.]]\nThe Fyris river (Fyris\u00e5n) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.\n\nThe most outstanding building in Uppsala is the ''Domkyrka'' ([[Uppsala Cathedral]]), Scandinavia's largest church building ({{convert|118.70|m|2|abbr=on}} high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala's skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.\n\nFacing the west end of the cathedral is the ''[[Gustavianum]]'', built in 1625 to be the main building of the University, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the University's cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century [[Archbishop's Palace, Uppsala|Archbishop's Palace]], the official residence of the Lutheran [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] and the primate of the Church of Sweden.\n\nAcross the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the [[University Hall (Uppsala University)|University Hall]], erected in 1879\u201386 in Italian [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance style]]. The [[Uppsala University Coin Cabinet]] is located in the university main building.\n[[File:Uppsala slott-2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Uppsala Castle]]]]\nNot far from the University stands the [[Uppsala University Library]] (''Carolina Rediviva''), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820\u201341.\n\nOn a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands ''[[Uppsala Castle]]''. Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King [[Gustav Vasa]], founder of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa royal dynasty]]. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the [[List of Uppsala Governors|Uppsala County Governor]] (''landsh\u00f6vding'').\n\nThere are several [[botanical garden|botanical museums]] in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the [[Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Uppsala)|Botanic Garden]] next to the castle, the [[Linnaean Garden]] in the city centre, and [[Linnaeus Hammarby]], Linnaeus' summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.\n\n{{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} north of Uppsala city lies ''[[Gamla Uppsala]]'' (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old [[Temple at Uppsala|heathen temple]] (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/se_och_besoka/gamla_uppsala.html |title=Gamla Uppsala \u2013 Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet |publisher=Raa.se |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref> The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of [[Uppland]], as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.\n\n==Transportation==\nTrains depart [[Uppsala Central Station]] in three directions. There are trains to the south , [[Arlanda]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Link\u00f6ping]], to the northwest, [[Dalarna]] and [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]], and to the north [[G\u00e4vle]], [[Sundsvall]], [[\u00d6stersund]] and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to [[Narvik]] in Norway.\n\nWhile Uppsala has no airport of its own, [[Arlanda Airport]] is located about 30&nbsp;km south of Uppsala. [[\u00c4rna Airport]] north of Uppsala is a military airport.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Bandyfinal2010 hammarby celebration.jpg|thumb|Celebrations after the 2010 national [[bandy]] final at [[Studenternas IP]]]]\n\nThe largest arena in Uppsala is [[Fyrishov]] and is Sweden's fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB's business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children's pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.\n\nIn addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs T\u00e4vlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.\n\nAt Fyrishov the city's basketball team [[Uppsala Basket]] also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden's oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and [[Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap]], one of the world's oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball.

Today's Uppsala was then called ''\u00d6stra Aros'' (Eastern Aros, to differentiate it from [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s|Western Aros]]).

In 1160, King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric Jedvardsson]] was attacked and killed outside the church of \u00d6stra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. In 1274, \u00d6stra Aros overtook Gamla Uppsala as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to \u00d6stra Aros, where the present-day [[Uppsala Cathedral]] was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching {{convert|118.70|m}}.\n\nThe city is the site of the oldest university in Scandinavia, founded in 1477, and is where [[Carl Linnaeus]], one of the renowned scholars of [[Uppsala University]], lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century [[Uppsala Castle]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608163154/http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |archive-date=8 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> {{anchor|1702 fire}}The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702. Historical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the [[Coat of Arms of Sweden]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Buss i Stora Torget, Uppsala.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stora Torget (town square): The building in the background is the Nordbankshuset.]]\nSituated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River ([[Fyris\u00e5n]]) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the [[Esker|glacial ridge]] of Uppsala\u00e5sen at an elevation around {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the site of Uppsala's castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park ''Stadsskogen'' (literally \"City Forest\") stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.\n\nOnly some {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]] takes only 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air.\n\nThe commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct [[town and gown]] divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the [[Fj\u00e4rdingen]] neighbourhood on the river's western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed until today. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place.\n\n=== Climate ===\nUppsala lies immediately south of the [[60th parallel north]] and has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold winters and warm summers. Due to its northerly location, Uppsala experiences over 18 hours of visible sunshine during the [[summer solstice]], and under 6 hours of sunshine during the [[winter solstice]].  Despite Uppsala's northerly location, the winter is not as cold as other cities at similar latitudes, mainly due to the [[Gulf Stream]]. For example, in January Uppsala has a daily mean of \u22122.7&nbsp;\u00b0C (27.1&nbsp;\u00b0F). In [[Canada]], at the same latitude, [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] experiences a daily mean of \u221222.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u22128.3&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Climate chart\n| Uppsala, Sweden\n| \u22125.6 | -0.3 | 39\n| \u22126.2 | 0.1 | 30\n| \u22123.3 | 3.8 | 33\n| 0.4 | 10.1 | 32\n| 5.1 | 16.4 | 39\n| 9.4 | 19.8 | 61\n| 12.5 | 22.7 | 65\n| 11.5 | 21.2 | 74\n| 7.3 | 15.9 | 52\n| 3.3 | 9.7 | 53\n| \u22120.8 | 4.0 | 53\n| \u22124.4 | 0.7 | 46\n|float = left\n|clear = none\n|source = http://celsius.met.uu.se/default.aspx?pageid=24 | celsius.met.uu.se }}\n\nWith respect to record temperatures, the difference between the highest and lowest is relatively large. Uppsala\u2019s highest recorded temperature was {{convert|37.4|C|F|1}}, recorded in July 1933.<ref>http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/temperaturrekord-i-stockholm-och-uppsala-1.4735</ref> On the same day [[Ultuna]], which lies a few kilometres south of the centre of Uppsala, recorded a temperature of {{convert|38|C|F|1}}. This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], although the same temperature was recorded in [[M\u00e5lilla]], Sweden, 14 years later. Uppsala\u2019s lowest temperature was recorded in January 1875, when the temperature dropped to {{convert|-39.5|C|F|1}}. The second-lowest temperature recorded is {{convert|-33.1|C|F|1}}, which makes the record one of the hardest to beat, due to the fact that temperatures in Uppsala nowadays rarely goes below {{convert|-30|C|F|0}}. The difference between the two records is {{convert|76.9|C-change|1}}.\n\nThe warmest month ever recorded is July 2018, with a daily mean of 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (70.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since 2002 Uppsala has experienced 6 months where the daily mean was 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) or warmer, the most recent in July 2018 when the daily mean was 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (68.9&nbsp;\u00b0F). The coldest month ever recorded is January 1814, when the daily mean was \u221214.9&nbsp;\u00b0C (5.2&nbsp;\u00b0F). Between January 1814 and January 1987, Uppsala experienced 23 months that were colder than \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C (14&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since February 1987, the coldest month recorded is \u22128.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (16.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). The warmest year ever recorded was 2014, with an average temperature of 8.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The second warmest is 2018, with 8.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (46&nbsp;\u00b0F). Since 1991, Uppsala has recorded 15 years with an average temperature of 7&nbsp;\u00b0C (44.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) or warmer. The coldest year ever recorded was 1867, with an average temperature of 2.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (36.5&nbsp;\u00b0F). 1987 was the last year Uppsala recorded a year with an average temperature below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C (41&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe climate table below presents weather data from 1981\u20132010. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during  1981\u20132010 as compared with the 1951\u20131980 series. This increase is on an annual basis around 0.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Warming is most pronounced during the winter and spring. January, February, and March have had the most pronouncing increase in temperature, with each month increasing 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or more. The only month that did not get warmer is June, which got 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C colder. During the 20th century, Uppsala has warmed drastically, especially the winter. If compared to the period 1861\u20131890, the annual increase in temperature is 1.8&nbsp;\u00b0C. March is the month with the biggest increase, where the temperature has increased more than 3&nbsp;\u00b0C since the latter parts of the 19th century.\n\nWinter normally arrives in late November, and lasts until the middle of March when spring arrives. Summer usually arrives in the middle of May, and lasts until late September when autumn arrives.<ref>http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/arstider-1.1082</ref> Precipitation is most common between June and November, in all these months it falls 50&nbsp;mm (2.0&nbsp;in) or more on average. August receives most precipitation with 74&nbsp;mm (2.9&nbsp;in). Between January and May precipitation levels fall a bit, with all months receiving less than 40&nbsp;mm (1.6&nbsp;in) on average.

Founded in 1477, under bishop [[Jakob Ulvsson]]. Originally a Catholic institution, after limited activity following the [[Reformation]] it was re-organised as a Lutheran institution in 1595, following the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593. The university has a famous [[anatomical theatre]], constructed by the scientist and [[polymath]] [[Olof Rudbeck]] (1630\u20131702), in the old university building [[Gustavianum]]. The building is now a museum. The university has 13 student fraternities, known as \"nations\", each traditionally representing a geographical region of Sweden.\n*[[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] (SLU, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, main campus).\n\n=== Other higher education ===\n* [[Johannelunds Teologiska H\u00f6gskola]]. A Lutheran theological seminary established in 1862, located in Uppsala since 1970.\n* The [[Newman Institute (Uppsala)|Newman Institute]]. A Catholic institution founded in 2001.\n* [[Pingstr\u00f6relsens teologiska seminarium]]. A Pentecostal theological seminary, which does not have [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] from the Swedish [[National Agency for Higher Education]] and cannot confer Swedish academic degrees.\n\n== Museums and sights ==\n[[File:Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, Uppsala II.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Uppsala)|The Botanical Garden]] at Uppsala Castle.]]\nThe Fyris river (Fyris\u00e5n) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.\n\nThe most outstanding building in Uppsala is the ''Domkyrka'' ([[Uppsala Cathedral]]), Scandinavia's largest church building ({{convert|118.70|m|2|abbr=on}} high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala's skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.\n\nFacing the west end of the cathedral is the ''[[Gustavianum]]'', built in 1625 to be the main building of the University, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the University's cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century [[Archbishop's Palace, Uppsala|Archbishop's Palace]], the official residence of the Lutheran [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] and the primate of the Church of Sweden.\n\nAcross the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the [[University Hall (Uppsala University)|University Hall]], erected in 1879\u201386 in Italian [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance style]]. The [[Uppsala University Coin Cabinet]] is located in the university main building.\n[[File:Uppsala slott-2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Uppsala Castle]]]]\nNot far from the University stands the [[Uppsala University Library]] (''Carolina Rediviva''), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820\u201341.\n\nOn a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands ''[[Uppsala Castle]]''. Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King [[Gustav Vasa]], founder of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa royal dynasty]]. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the [[List of Uppsala Governors|Uppsala County Governor]] (''landsh\u00f6vding'').\n\nThere are several [[botanical garden|botanical museums]] in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the [[Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Uppsala)|Botanic Garden]] next to the castle, the [[Linnaean Garden]] in the city centre, and [[Linnaeus Hammarby]], Linnaeus' summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.\n\n{{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} north of Uppsala city lies ''[[Gamla Uppsala]]'' (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old [[Temple at Uppsala|heathen temple]] (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/se_och_besoka/gamla_uppsala.html |title=Gamla Uppsala \u2013 Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet |publisher=Raa.se |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref> The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of [[Uppland]], as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.\n\n==Transportation==\nTrains depart [[Uppsala Central Station]] in three directions. There are trains to the south , [[Arlanda]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Link\u00f6ping]], to the northwest, [[Dalarna]] and [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]], and to the north [[G\u00e4vle]], [[Sundsvall]], [[\u00d6stersund]] and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to [[Narvik]] in Norway.\n\nWhile Uppsala has no airport of its own, [[Arlanda Airport]] is located about 30&nbsp;km south of Uppsala. [[\u00c4rna Airport]] north of Uppsala is a military airport.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Bandyfinal2010 hammarby celebration.jpg|thumb|Celebrations after the 2010 national [[bandy]] final at [[Studenternas IP]]]]\n\nThe largest arena in Uppsala is [[Fyrishov]] and is Sweden's fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB's business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children's pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.\n\nIn addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs T\u00e4vlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.\n\nAt Fyrishov the city's basketball team [[Uppsala Basket]] also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden's oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and [[Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap]], one of the world's oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball.

For several years after his birth, his father altered the conclusion of \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\" to mention him by name; in 1972 his parents recorded the duet \"I Got a Boy (And His Name is John)\" about their son; and in 1975 a photograph of John Carter Cash frolicking with his father adorned the sleeve of the album ''[[Look at Them Beans]]''. John Carter Cash also dabbled in recording music, duetting with his father on two tracks recorded for the 1988 Johnny Cash album ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]''.\n\nHe began his work as a music producer with his mother June Carter Cash on her album, ''[[Press On]]'', which won a [[Grammy]] in 1999,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1732201/john-carter-cash-removes-clothes-at-canadian-airport/|title=John Carter Cash Removes Clothes at Canadian Airport|work=CMT News|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref> then went on to work under [[Rick Rubin]] as Associate Producer on his father Johnny Cash's Grammy winning records ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'', the latter receiving three [[Country Music Association]] awards.\n\nHe also produced his mother's record ''[[Wildwood Flower (album)|Wildwood Flower]]'', which won a Grammy for Best Traditional Folk album in 2003.

His newest release is titled ''We Must Believe in Magic''.\n\nHe is the author of three children's books \u2013 ''Momma Loves Her Little Son'', ''Daddy Loves His Little Girl'', and his latest release, ''The Cat in the Rhinestone Suit''. He authored a biography on his mother, ''Anchored in Love'' (which was turned into a [[Lifetime Movie Network|Lifetime]] movie titled ''Ring of Fire'') and one on his personal relationship with his father, ''House of Cash: The Legacies of My Father Johnny Cash''.
