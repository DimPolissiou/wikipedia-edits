Eastland, an engineer and clerk at the foundry, joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find. In July 1852, James applied for and received from the [[San Francisco Common Council|Common Council of the City of San Francisco]] a franchise to erect a gasworks, lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with \"brilliant gas\". The council specified that gas should be supplied to households \"at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material\".<ref name=\"Coleman_PGE_1952\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} The Donahue brothers and Eastland incorporated the San Francisco Gas Company on August 31, 1852, with $150,000 of [[authorized capital]]. The company became the first gas [[utility]] in the West. Its official seal bore the inscription \"[[Fiat Lux]]\"\u2014let there be light\u2014the same slogan later adopted by the University of California. There were 11 original stockholders, and the three Donahue brothers subscribed for 610 of the 1,500 shares.<ref name=\"Coleman_PGE_1952\" />{{rp|12}}\n\nThe original location for the gas works was bounded by First, Fremont, Howard and Natoma streets south of Market, on the then shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Work on the plant started in November 1852, and it was ready for operation only a few months later. On the night of February 11, 1854, the streets of San Francisco were for the first time lighted by gas. To celebrate the event, the company held a gala banquet at the Oriental Hotel.<ref name=\"Coleman_PGE_1952\" />{{rp|13}} Gas lighting quickly gained public favor.

It consisted of two subsidiaries\u2014PG&E, the regulated utility, and a non-regulated energy business.\n\nIn the later 1990s, under [[electricity market]] [[deregulation]] this utility sold off most of its [[natural gas]] [[power plant]]s. The utility retained all of its [[hydroelectric]] plants, the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] and a few natural gas plants, but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity. This had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices, while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost. However, the market for electricity was dominated by the [[Enron Corporation]], which, with help from other corporations, artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher. This led to the [[California electricity crisis]] that began in 2000 on [[Path 15]], a transmission corridor PG&E built.\n\nWith a critical power shortage, rolling blackouts began on January 17, 2001.\n\n===1990s fires===\nIn 1994, PG&E caused the [[Traumer Fire]] in [[Nevada County, California|Nevada County]], California through criminal negligence. The fire burned many acres of land and destroyed a schoolhouse and twelve homes near town of [[Rough and Ready, California|Rough and Ready]], California. PG&E was found guilty of causing the fire and of 739 counts of criminal negligence.<ref>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Guilty-In-1994-Sierra-Blaze-739-counts-of-2821364.php</ref>\n\nIn 1996, one of PG&E's substations in the Mission District of San Francisco caught fire.

The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) set the rates that PG&E could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the CPUC.\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states and in California reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available. Usually PG&E could buy \"cheap\" hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the [[Bonneville Dam]] and other sources. Drought and delays in approval of new power plants and [[market manipulation]] decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state. Hot weather brought on higher usage, [[rolling blackout]]s, and other problems.\n\nWith little excess generating capacity of its own PG&E was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts. Because PG&E had to buy additional electricity to meet demand, some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates, as exemplified by the [[Enron scandal]]. The CPUC refused to adjust the allowable electric rates.

Morris |date=May 1, 2019 |page=D1 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>\n\n====Liability====\nState law follows a principle of \"[[inverse condemnation]]\" for wildfire liability, which means that utilities are held responsible for damages resulting from {{em|any}} fire caused by their equipment, even if their maintenance on equipment and surrounding vegetation was done to standards.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders on Wednesday declined to embrace requests from Wall Street to change California&apos;s controversial wildfire liability law, instead throwing their support behind a proposed multibillion-dollar fund to help utilities pay for wildfire damages and legislation to more clearly define when ratepayers would pick up the bill for claims. The state leaders said they would continue to explore \u201cthe impact of strict liability\u201d on ratepayers, wildfire victims and the utilities. California uses the legal principle of \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d to determine liability and holds utilities responsible for wildfire property damages even if negligence isn&apos;t proved.}}\nThis policy resulted in $30B of liability for PG&E from the 2017 & 2018 fires and drove it to bankruptcy proceedings.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of massive legal fees resulting from wildfires linked to its electrical equipment in recent years. State law requires utilities to pay for such fires, regardless of whether a company&apos;s negligence may have caused the blaze.}}{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=Under state guidelines, a utility or its customers are responsible for paying property damages from wildfires linked to the company&apos;s equipment. With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year.}}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negligence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ... The fund, propped up by $21 billion split equally between utility customers and shareholders, is meant to act as a second insurance policy for publicly traded electricity companies and to offset concerns from Wall Street about massive monetary liabilities that have threatened to upend the energy market in California. ... The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire.}}\n\n====Undergrounding====\n\n[[Public utility|Public utilities]] in the state of California have a total of 26,000 miles of high voltage [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines, and 240,000 miles of [[Electric power distribution|distribution lines]].  Distribution lines bring electricity to directly to homes; two thirds of them statewide are above ground.{{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=California has 25,526 miles of higher voltage transmission lines, and 239,557 miles of distribution lines, two-thirds of which are overhead, according to CPUC. }}\nFor transmission lines, the cost of undergrounding is about $80 million per mile{{ r | SFC_1 | p=1 | q=Those transmission lines, typically supported by tall, steel-lattice towers, carry electricity at high voltages across long distances. They are far more expensive to place in the ground than the lower-voltage distribution lines that bring electricity directly into residential neighborhoods. \u201cIt makes undergrounding distribution look cheap \u2014 think like $80 million a mile,\u201d Wara said. \u201cYou basically dig a trench and build a building around the transmission line.\u201d PG&E has more than 18,000 miles of transmission lines. }} while for distribution lines, the cost of underground lines is about $3 million per mile, compared to overhead lines at about $800,000 per mile.{{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=It costs about $3 million per mile to convert underground electric distribution lines from overhead, while the cost to build a mile of new overhead line is less than a third of that, at approximately $800,000 per mile,... }}\n\nThe state's largest utility, PG&E, has 107,000 miles of distribution lines, 81,000 miles of which are overhead.  The cost to convert all of PG&E's overhead distribution lines to underground lines would cost a total of $240 billion, or $15,000 per PG&E customer. (This cost estimate is only for distribution lines, not the higher voltage transmission lines.){{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=PG&E, the state&apos;s largest utility, maintains approximately 81,000 miles of overhead distribution lines and approximately 26,000 miles of underground distribution lines. It also has about 18,000 miles of larger transmission lines, the majority of which are overhead lines. At a cost of $3 million per mile, undergrounding 81,000 miles of distribution lines would cost $243 billion.

In July 1852, James applied for and received from the [[San Francisco Common Council|Common Council of the City of San Francisco]] a franchise to erect a gasworks, lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with \"brilliant gas\".

To celebrate the event, the company held a gala banquet at the Oriental Hotel.<ref name=\"Coleman_PGE_1952\" />{{rp|13}} Gas lighting quickly gained public favor. In the first year of operation, there were 237 customers. That number more than doubled the next year, to 563.

It consisted of two subsidiaries\u2014PG&E, the regulated utility, and a non-regulated energy business.\n\nIn the later 1990s, under [[electricity market]] [[deregulation]] this utility sold off most of its [[natural gas]] [[power plant]]s. The utility retained all of its [[hydroelectric]] plants, the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] and a few natural gas plants, but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity. This had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices, while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost. However, the market for electricity was dominated by the [[Enron Corporation]], which, with help from other corporations, artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher. This led to the [[California electricity crisis]] that began in 2000 on [[Path 15]], a transmission corridor PG&E built.\n\nWith a critical power shortage, rolling blackouts began on January 17, 2001.\n\n===1990s fires===\nIn 1994, PG&E caused the [[Traumer Fire]] in [[Nevada County]], California through criminal negligence. The fire burned many acres of land and destroyed a schoolhouse and twelve homes near town of [[Rough and Ready]], California. PG&E was found guilty of causing the fire and of 739 counts of criminal negligence.<ref>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Guilty-In-1994-Sierra-Blaze-739-counts-of-2821364.php</ref>\n\nIn 1996, one of PG&E's substations in the Mission District of San Francisco caught fire. PG&E was eventually found legally culpable for the fire due to criminal negligence, according to an investigation in 2003.<ref>https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Fires-at-PG-E-s-SF-substations-a-recurring-11119604.php</ref>\n\nThe 1999 Pendola fire in the [[Plumas National Forest]] and [[Tahoe National Forest]] burned nearly 12,000 acres of forest was found to have been caused by poor vegetation management by PG&E.<ref>https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/pge-to-pay-close-to-15m-in-fire-settlement/</ref>\n\n===2001 bankruptcy===\n{{Main|California electricity crisis}}\nIn 1998, a change in the regulation of California's public utilities, including PG&E, began. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) set the rates that PG&E could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the CPUC.\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states and in California reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available. Usually PG&E could buy \"cheap\" hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the [[Bonneville Dam]] and other sources. Drought and delays in approval of new power plants and [[market manipulation]] decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state. Hot weather brought on higher usage, [[rolling blackout]]s, and other problems.\n\nWith little excess generating capacity of its own PG&E was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts. Because PG&E had to buy additional electricity to meet demand, some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates, as exemplified by the [[Enron scandal]]. The CPUC refused to adjust the allowable electric rates.

Morris |date=May 1, 2019 |page=D1 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>\n\n====Liability====\nState law follows a principle of \"[[inverse condemnation]]\" for wildfire liability, which means that utilities are held responsible for damages resulting from {{em|any}} fire caused by their equipment, even if their maintenance on equipment and surrounding vegetation was done to standards.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders on Wednesday declined to embrace requests from Wall Street to change California&apos;s controversial wildfire liability law, instead throwing their support behind a proposed multibillion-dollar fund to help utilities pay for wildfire damages and legislation to more clearly define when ratepayers would pick up the bill for claims. The state leaders said they would continue to explore \u201cthe impact of strict liability\u201d on ratepayers, wildfire victims and the utilities. California uses the legal principle of \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d to determine liability and holds utilities responsible for wildfire property damages even if negligence isn&apos;t proved.}}\nThis policy resulted in $30B of liability for PG&E from the 2017 & 2018 fires and drove it to bankruptcy proceedings.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of massive legal fees resulting from wildfires linked to its electrical equipment in recent years. State law requires utilities to pay for such fires, regardless of whether a company&apos;s negligence may have caused the blaze.}}{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=Under state guidelines, a utility or its customers are responsible for paying property damages from wildfires linked to the company&apos;s equipment. With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year.}}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negligence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ... The fund, propped up by $21 billion split equally between utility customers and shareholders, is meant to act as a second insurance policy for publicly traded electricity companies and to offset concerns from Wall Street about massive monetary liabilities that have threatened to upend the energy market in California. ... The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire.}}\n\n====Undergrounding====\n\n[[Public utility|Public utilities]] in the state of California have a total of 26,000 miles of high voltage [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines, and 240,000 miles of [[Electric power distribution|distribution lines]].  Distribution lines bring electricity to directly to homes; two thirds of them statewide are above ground.{{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=California has 25,526 miles of higher voltage transmission lines, and 239,557 miles of distribution lines, two-thirds of which are overhead, according to CPUC. }}\nFor transmission lines, the cost of undergrounding is about $80 million per mile{{ r | SFC_1 | p=1 | q=Those transmission lines, typically supported by tall, steel-lattice towers, carry electricity at high voltages across long distances. They are far more expensive to place in the ground than the lower-voltage distribution lines that bring electricity directly into residential neighborhoods. \u201cIt makes undergrounding distribution look cheap \u2014 think like $80 million a mile,\u201d Wara said. \u201cYou basically dig a trench and build a building around the transmission line.\u201d PG&E has more than 18,000 miles of transmission lines. }} while for distribution lines, the cost of underground lines is about $3 million per mile, compared to overhead lines at about $800,000 per mile.{{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=It costs about $3 million per mile to convert underground electric distribution lines from overhead, while the cost to build a mile of new overhead line is less than a third of that, at approximately $800,000 per mile,... }}\n\nThe state's largest utility, PG&E, has 107,000 miles of distribution lines, 81,000 miles of which are overhead.  The cost to convert all of PG&E's overhead distribution lines to underground lines would cost a total of $240 billion, or $15,000 per PG&E customer. (This cost estimate is only for distribution lines, not the higher voltage transmission lines.){{ r | USN_1| p=1 | q=PG&E, the state&apos;s largest utility, maintains approximately 81,000 miles of overhead distribution lines and approximately 26,000 miles of underground distribution lines. It also has about 18,000 miles of larger transmission lines, the majority of which are overhead lines. At a cost of $3 million per mile, undergrounding 81,000 miles of distribution lines would cost $243 billion.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It was originally published in 1992.<ref>Fantastic Fiction [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/terry-pratchett/lords-and-ladies.htm Lords and Ladies (Discworld, book 14) Terry Pratchett] Retrieved 2009-05-9</ref>  Some parts of the storyline spoof elements of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Granny Weatherwax]], [[Nanny Ogg]], and [[Magrat Garlick]]  return to [[Lancre]] after their [[Witches Abroad|recent adventure]] in [[Genua (Discworld)|Genua]]. Magrat is stunned when [[Verence II|King Verence]] proclaims their imminent marriage, having already made all the arrangements in her absence.  The sudden appearance of [[crop circles]] reveals to Nanny and Granny that it is now \"circle time\", a convergence of [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] when the Discworld is susceptible to incursions from the \"parasite universe\" of the Elves. Elves are capricious and amoral creatures that enter the minds of animals and sentient beings in a more destructive way than witches do, using \"glamour\" to alter human's perceptions of them.  They are normally kept away by a circle of [[Magnetism|magnetized]] iron [[standing stones]] known as the Dancers. When Nanny and Granny refuse to explain the situation to Magrat, she leaves the coven, disavows witchcraft, and moves into an apartment in Lancre Castle.  She soon becomes bored with the courtly lifestyle and unsure of her place.\n\n[[Mustrum Ridcully]], Archchancellor of [[Unseen University]], leads a small group of faculty to attend the wedding.  Along the way, they are joined by the Dwarfish lothario [[Casanunda]].\n\nGranny and Nanny discover that a group of local girls, led by [[Witches (Discworld)#Diamanda Tockley|Diamanda Tockley]] and including  [[Agnes Nitt]], have formed a new coven whose activities include dancing naked at the Dancers.  The two elderly witches try to convince them to stop, with Granny ultimately besting Diamanda in a public witchcraft contest and discrediting the new coven.  But a defiant Diamanda later runs through the Dancers into the land of the Elves, where she is knocked unconscious by a poisoned Elven arrow before being rescued by Granny.  Nanny subdues an Elf that pursues them back into Lancre, using an iron fireplace poker; Elves and their powers are severely weakened by iron.  The witches bring Diamanda and the Elf to Lancre Castle, where Magrat treats Diamanda and Verence agrees to imprison the Elf (though Magrat inadvertently frees it later).  Meanwhile, Granny has begun to experience memories of other paths her life has taken in parallel worlds, as well as a growing sense of her own impending death.\n\n[[Jason Ogg]] and the other Lancre Morris Men plan a play to be performed for the wedding guests.  When they rehearse near the Dancers, the Elves influence them to include Elvish elements in the play.  As a result, when the play is performed at the Dancers, it causes sufficient belief\u2014a powerful force on the Discworld\u2014that the Elves are able to make the guests dismantle the stone circle. The Elves arrive, and the Elf Queen plans to legitimize her rule of Lancre by marrying Verence.  None of the members of the Lancre coven are present at this time: Magrat has locked herself in her room due to perceived insults in a letter she has discovered, written by Granny to Verence, advising him to plan the wedding; Nanny is being romanced by Casanunda; and Granny has been magically whisked away by Ridcully, who hopes to resume a romantic connection they had when much younger.  The women only become aware of what has happened once the Elves begin to wreak havoc in Lancre.  Aided only by general [[Dogsbody|dogsbody]] [[Shawn Ogg]], Magrat fights her way through the infiltrated castle.  She discovers a portrait of Queen Ynci, one of the kingdom's legendary founders.  Suddenly inspired by the idea of becoming a ''warrior ''queen, Magrat finds and dons Ynci's [[armour]].  Feeling influenced by Ynci's spirit (and unaware that Ynci is a fiction, the armour constructed from cookware only a few generations previously), she rescues a captured Shawn and sets out for the Dancers.  While Granny and Ridcully make their way through the woods, resulting in Granny's capture by the Elves, Nanny and Casanunda travel through a gateway to the abode of the Elf King, who opposes the Elf Queen despite being her spouse.\n\nAt the Dancers, Magrat arrives to confront the Elf Queen at the same time as the people of Lancre, rallied by Shawn and Nanny.  But the Elf Queen quickly subdues Magrat with glamour.  The captive Granny mentally combats the Elf Queen and releases Magrat from the glamour before succumbing to the Elf Queen's attack, her prone body being covered by the bees from her hive, which have swarmed at the Dancers.  When the Elf Queen turns her powers on Magrat, attempting to stop her resistance by dismantling her identity, she exposes the unexpectedly valorous core of Magrat's being, (something which Granny had deliberately been stoking, aggravating and provoking all along for just this very outcome).  Magrat attacks and subdues the Elf Queen just in time for a projection of the Elf King to arrive and send the Elves back to their world.\n\nGranny appears to be dead, but then Nanny and Magrat learn that she has actually borrowed her bees' hive mind; a feat thought impossible.  They break open a window in the castle, where Ridcully has reverently laid Granny's body, enabling the bees to get close enough for her to regain consciousness.

It was originally published in 1992.<ref>Fantastic Fiction [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/terry-pratchett/lords-and-ladies.htm Lords and Ladies (Discworld, book 14) Terry Pratchett] Retrieved 2009-05-9</ref>  Some parts of the storyline spoof elements of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Granny Weatherwax]], [[Nanny Ogg]], and [[Magrat Garlick]]  return to [[Lancre]] after their [[Witches Abroad|recent adventure]] in [[Genua (Discworld)|Genua]]. Magrat is stunned when [[Verence II|King Verence]] proclaims their imminent marriage, having already made all the arrangements in her absence.  The sudden appearance of [[crop circles]] reveals to Nanny and Granny that it is now \"circle time\", a convergence of [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] when the Discworld is susceptible to incursions from the \"parasite universe\" of the Elves. Elves are capricious and amoral creatures that enter the minds of animals and sentient beings in a more destructive way than witches do, using \"glamour\" to alter human's perceptions of them.  They are normally kept away by a circle of [[Magnetism|magnetized]] iron [[standing stones]] known as the Dancers. When Nanny and Granny refuse to explain the situation to Magrat, she leaves the coven, disavows witchcraft, and moves into an apartment in Lancre Castle.  She soon becomes bored with the courtly lifestyle and unsure of her place.\n\n[[Mustrum Ridcully]], Archchancellor of [[Unseen University]], leads a small group of faculty to attend the wedding.  Along the way, they are joined by the Dwarfish lothario [[Casanunda]].\n\nGranny and Nanny discover that a group of local girls, led by [[Witches (Discworld)#Diamanda Tockley|Diamanda Tockley]] and including  [[Agnes Nitt]], have formed a new coven whose activities include dancing naked at the Dancers.  The two elderly witches try to convince them to stop, with Granny ultimately besting Diamanda in a public witchcraft contest and discrediting the new coven.  But a defiant Diamanda later runs through the Dancers into the land of the Elves, where she is knocked unconscious by a poisoned Elven arrow before being rescued by Granny.  Nanny subdues an Elf that pursues them back into Lancre, using an iron fireplace poker; Elves and their powers are severely weakened by iron.  The witches bring Diamanda and the Elf to Lancre Castle, where Magrat treats Diamanda and Verence agrees to imprison the Elf (though Magrat inadvertently frees it later).  Meanwhile, Granny has begun to experience memories of other paths her life has taken in parallel worlds, as well as a growing sense of her own impending death.\n\n[[Jason Ogg]] and the other Lancre Morris Men plan a play to be performed for the wedding guests.  When they rehearse near the Dancers, the Elves influence them to include Elvish elements in the play.  As a result, when the play is performed at the Dancers, it causes sufficient belief\u2014a powerful force on the Discworld\u2014that the Elves are able to make the guests dismantle the stone circle. The Elves arrive, and the Elf Queen plans to legitimize her rule of Lancre by marrying Verence.  None of the members of the Lancre coven are present at this time: Magrat has locked herself in her room due to perceived insults in a letter she has discovered, written by Granny to Verence, advising him to plan the wedding; Nanny is being romanced by Casanunda; and Granny has been magically whisked away by Ridcully, who hopes to resume a romantic connection they had when much younger.  The women only become aware of what has happened once the Elves begin to wreak havoc in Lancre.  Aided only by general [[Dogsbody|dogsbody]] [[Shawn Ogg]], Magrat fights her way though the infiltrated castle.  She discovers a portrait of Queen Ynci, one of the kingdom's legendary founders.  Suddenly inspired by the idea of becoming a ''warrior ''queen, Magrat finds and dons Ynci's [[armour]].  Feeling influenced by Ynci's spirit (and unaware that Ynci is a fiction, the armour constructed from cookware only a few generations previously), she rescues a captured Shawn and sets out for the Dancers.  While Granny and Ridcully make their way through the woods, resulting in Granny's capture by the Elves, Nanny and Casanunda travel through a gateway to the abode of the Elf King, who opposes the Elf Queen despite being her spouse.\n\nAt the Dancers, Magrat arrives to confront the Elf Queen at the same time as the people of Lancre, rallied by Shawn and Nanny.  But the Elf Queen quickly subdues Magrat with glamour.  The captive Granny mentally combats the Elf Queen and releases Magrat from the glamour before succumbing to the Elf Queen's attack, her prone body being covered by the bees from her hive, which have swarmed at the Dancers.  When the Elf Queen turns her powers on Magrat, attempting to stop her resistance by dismantling her identity, she exposes the unexpectedly valorous core of Magrat's being, (something which Granny had deliberately been stoking, aggravating and provoking all along for just this very outcome).  Magrat attacks and subdues the Elf Queen just in time for a projection of the Elf King to arrive and send the Elves back to their world.\n\nGranny appears to be dead, but then Nanny and Magrat learn that she has actually borrowed her bees' hive mind; a feat thought impossible.  They break open a window in the castle, where Ridcully has reverently laid Granny's body, enabling the bees to get close enough for her to regain consciousness.  Nanny points out to Magrat that Granny's letter to Verence has had a great positive impact on Magrat's life, as well as giving her the strength to fight the Elf Queen.  Magrat and Verence are married by Ridcully.  Later, Granny and Ridcully make peace with their past and their place in the universe.  The growing sense of impending death she had been feeling had been due to the impending deaths of some of her parallel-selves.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Discworld#Lords and Ladies|Lords and Ladies}}\n* {{isfdb title|272}}\n*[http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/lords-and-ladies.html Annotations at the L-Space Web]\n*[http://www.lspace.org/books/pqf/lords-and-ladies.html Quotations]\n* [http://www.lspace.org/books/synopses/lords-and-ladies.html Synopsis]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-other|[[Discworld reading order|Reading order guide]]}}\n{{succession box | before = [[Small Gods]]| title = 14th [[Discworld#Novels|Discworld Novel]]  | years= | after = [[Men at Arms]]}}\n{{succession box | before = [[Witches Abroad]]| title = 4th [[Witches (Discworld)|Witches Story]]  | years=Published in 1992  | after = [[Maskerade]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Discworld books}}\n{{Terry Pratchett}}\n{{A Midsummer Night's Dream}}\n\n[[Category:1992 British novels]]\n[[Category:Discworld books]]\n[[Category:1992 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Elves in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Works based on A Midsummer Night's Dream]]\n[[Category:Novels based on plays]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_and_Ladies_(novel)"}

It is an important early railway complex that maintains its setting (largely through main road bypass) and which forms an important visual element in the valley viewed from both road approaches and from the level crossing. The changing view of the structure from the road is the visual focus of the town which is now a remnant of its previous importance as a centre for the production of fine wool.\nThe station building symbolises the confidence in railway construction and the transition towards a railway architecture. It is a rare example of a combined station/residence, five of which remain. All similar structures, found further west towards [[Blayney, New South Wales|Blayney]], have major alteration or extensions.\nThe other items on the site are significant as they indicate the development of the system and how early sites adapted to duplication and increased traffic followed by more recently decreased traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1239/>\n\nRydal railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1239/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThis item is assessed as historically rare.

It is an important early railway complex that maintains its setting (largely through main road bypass) and which forms an important visual element in the valley viewed from both road approaches and from the level crossing. The changing view of the structure from the road is the visual focus of the town which is now a remnant of its previous importance as a centre for the production of fine wool.\nThe station building symbolises the confidence in railway construction and the transition towards a railway architecture. It is a rare example of a combined station/residence, five of which remain. All similar structures, found further west towards [[Blayney, New South Wales|Blayney]], have major alteration or extensions.\nThe other items on the site are significant as they indicate the development of the system and how early sites adapted to duplication and increased traffic followed by more recently decreased traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1239/>\n\nRydal railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1239/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThis item is assessed as historically rare.

Park avowed that South Korea would break away from its long-pursued development model that centered around the nation, and shift the focus of government administration from the state to individual citizens. Through this process the structure of co-prosperity would be created, in which citizens became happy and national development occurred as a result. Park's administrative vision and basic principles for governing the nation were concretely outlined in her policy plans for the economy, society, welfare, diplomacy, and unification. The administration's keywords in managing state affairs were \"people\", \"happiness\", \"trust\", \"co-prosperity\" and \"principle\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.president.go.kr/government/philosophy/philosophy.php |title=THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA CHEONG WA DAE |accessdate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208001650/http://english.president.go.kr/government/philosophy/philosophy.php |archivedate= 8 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Government restructuring ====\nRight after taking office, Park restructured the Blue House and government organization to carry out her administrative vision.
