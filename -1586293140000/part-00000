She's also called '''Sophonisbe''' and '''Sophoniba'''. However, her true name might be unclear. Her story is told in [[Livy]] (30.12.11-15.11), [[Diodorus]] (27.7), [[Appian]] (Pun. 27-28), and [[Cassius Dio]] (Zonaras 9.11), but [[Polybius]], who had met Masinissa, never refers to Sophonisba by name in his allusions to her (14.4ff.).

However, the Carthaginian Senate prohibited the wedding and ordered Sophonisba to marry Syphax, chieftain of the western [[Masaesyli]], who up to that point had been allied to Rome.

The trajectory of the photon represented in space time coordinates in the mirror's reference frame would be a triangular wave.\n** since both are relativity related, Kyary is very probably dressed as Einstein in her eureka moment\n** subtractive color synthesis, the colors one minute into the video are CMYK\n** periodic functions and a triangular wave where the video repeats itself, shown when Kyary sings 'onnaji tokoro' (same place). Jun Tamukai cited the Chemical brothers' Star Guitar as an influence. The video clip can be looped as the end chains to the beginning.\n** simple mathematics, with plus signs, multiplication and numbers\n* popular and classical culture\n** [[Back to the future]], with an hoverboard and a ligthning strike\n** [[Journey to the West]], where the Monkey King confronts the Buddha and is told he will be free if he escapes his hand, the Monkey King jumps as far as possible, finds five pillars and inscribes his name, when he lands the buddha shows him his palm with the Monkey King's name written.\n** [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] a surreal fantasy literary universe where the world is resting on four elephants resting on a turtle. With a nod to science, the world is not flat and coriolis forces induce the presence of jet stream. The three elephants instead of four might be for aesthetic reasons or to avoid the number four, associated with bad luck in Japan, Korea and China.\n** Fish swimming in a pond, drawn in the style of sumi-e or Chinese ink painting.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Kyary Pamyu Pamyu}}\n\n[[Category:2014 songs]]\n[[Category:Kyary Pamyu Pamyu songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Yasutaka Nakata]]\n[[Category:2014 singles]]\n[[Category:Unborde singles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song\n| name       = Kira Kira Killer\n| cover      = Kira Kira Killer.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]]\n| album      = [[Pika Pika Fantajin]]\n| released   = June 11, 2014\n| format     = CD, Digital Download\n| recorded   = February 2014\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[J-pop]], [[technopop]]\n| length     = 4:16\n| label      = [[Unborde]]\n| writer     = [[Yasutaka Nakata]]\n| producer   = Yasutaka Nakata\n| prev_title = [[Family Party (Kyary Pamyu Pamyu song)|Family Party]]\n| prev_year  = 2014\n| next_title = [[Mondai Girl]]\n| next_year  = 2015\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|\"'''Kira Kira Killer'''\"|\u304d\u3089\u304d\u3089\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc|Kira Kira Kir\u0101|lit. \"Glitter Killer\"}} is the first limited run single <ref>http://kyary.asobisystem.com/discography/archive.php?category=2</ref> by Japanese singer [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]].

{"title_page": "Partial discharge", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=July 2013}}\nIn [[electrical engineering]],  '''partial discharge''' ('''PD''') is a localized [[dielectric breakdown]] (DB) (which does not completely bridge the space between the two conductors) of a small portion of a solid or fluid  [[electrical insulation]] (EI) system under [[high voltage]] (HV) stress. \nWhile a [[corona discharge]] (CD) is usually revealed by a relatively steady glow or [[brush discharge]] (BD) in air, partial discharges within solid insulation system are not visible.\n\nPD can occur in a gaseous, liquid or solid insulating medium. It often starts within gas voids, such as voids in solid epoxy insulation or bubbles in transformer oil. Protracted partial discharge can erode solid insulation and eventually lead to breakdown of insulation.\n\n==Discharge mechanism==\nPD usually begins within voids, cracks, or inclusions within a solid [[dielectric]], at [[Conductor (material)|conductor]]-dielectric interfaces within solid or liquid dielectrics, or in bubbles within liquid [[dielectric]]s.  Since PDs are limited to only a portion of the insulation, the discharges only partially bridge the distance between [[electrodes]]. PD can also occur along the boundary between different insulating materials.\n\n[[File:Partial discharge.svg|thumb|right| A partial discharge within solid insulation. When a spark jumps the gap within the gas-filled void, a small current flows in the conductors, attenuated by the voltage divider network Cx, Cy, Cz in parallel with the bulk capacitance Cb]]\n\nPartial discharges within an insulating material are usually initiated within gas-filled voids within the dielectric. Because the [[dielectric constant]] of the void is considerably less than the surrounding dielectric, the [[electric field]] across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric. If the voltage stress across the void is increased above the [[Corona discharge|corona]] inception voltage (CIV) for the gas within the void, PD activity will start within the void.\n\nPD can also occur along the surface of solid insulating materials if the surface tangential electric field is high enough to cause a breakdown along the insulator surface. This phenomenon commonly manifests itself on overhead line insulators, particularly on contaminated insulators during days of high humidity. Overhead lines  use air as their insulation medium.\n\n===PD equivalent circuit===\nThe equivalent circuit of a dielectric incorporating a cavity can be modeled as a capacitive [[voltage divider]] in parallel with another [[capacitor]]. The upper capacitor of the divider represents the parallel combination of the capacitances in series with the void and the lower capacitor represents the capacitance of the void. The parallel capacitor represents the remaining unvoided capacitance of the sample.\n\n===Partial discharge currents===\nWhenever partial discharge is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave goes through the [[zero crossing]]. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a \"high frequency\" [[current transducer]] which is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested.  The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval between the end of a burst and the beginning of the next burst.  As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2&nbsp;ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure.  The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded.  It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring [[resistor]] in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an [[oscilloscope]] via a matched [[coaxial]] cable.\n\nWhen PD, [[arcing]] or sparking occurs, electromagnetic waves propagate away from the fault site in all directions which contact the transformer tank and travel to earth (ground cable) where the HFCT is located to capture any EMI or EMP within the transformer, breaker, PT, CT, HV Cable, MCSG, LTC, LA, generator, large hv motors, etc. Detection of the high-frequency pulses will identify the existence of partial discharge, arcing or sparking. After PD or arcing is detected, the next step is to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time. Bandpass filtering is used to eliminate interference from system noises.\n\n==Discharge detection and measuring systems==\nWith the partial discharge measurement, the dielectric condition of high voltage equipment can be evaluated, and [[electrical treeing]] in the insulation can be detected and located. Partial discharge measurement can localize the damaged part of an insulated system.\n\nData collected during partial discharge testing is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test or to factory quality control standards. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition (new, strongly aged, faulty) of the device under test and appropriate maintenance and repair measures may be planned and organized in advance.\n\nPartial discharge measurement is applicable  to cables and accessories with various insulation materials, such as [[polyethylene]] or paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable. Partial discharge measurement is routinely carried out to assess the condition of the insulation system of rotating machines (motors and generators), [[transformer]]s, and gas-insulated [[switchgear]].\n\n=== Partial discharge measurement system ===\n\nA partial discharge measurement system basically consists of:\n\n* a cable or other object being tested\n* a coupling capacitor of low inductance design\n* a high-voltage supply with low background noise\n* high-voltage connections\n* a high voltage filter to reduce background noise from the power supply\n* a partial discharge detector\n* PC software for analysis\n\nA partial discharge detection system for in-service, energized electric power equipment:\n* a cable, transformer, or any MV/HV power equipment\n* Ultra High Frequency Sensor (UHF) Detection Bandwidth 300&nbsp;MHz-1.5GHz\n* High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) Bandwidth 500&nbsp;kHz-50&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Ultrasonic transducer|Ultrasonic microphone]] with center frequency 40&nbsp;kHz\n* Acoustic Contact Sensor with detection bandwidth 20&nbsp;kHz - 300&nbsp;kHz\n* TEV sensor or coupling capacitor  3&nbsp;MHz-100&nbsp;MHz\n* Phase-resolved analysis system to compare pulse timing to AC frequency\n\n=== The principle of partial discharge measurement ===\nA number of discharge detection schemes and partial discharge measurement methods have been invented since the importance of PD was realised early in the last century. Partial discharge currents tend to be of short duration and have rise times in the [[nanosecond]] realm. On an [[oscilloscope]], the discharges appear as evenly spaced burst events that occur at the peak of the sinewave. Random events are arcing or sparking.\nThe usual way of quantifying partial discharge magnitude is in pico[[coulomb]]s. The intensity of partial discharge is displayed versus time.\n\nAn automatic analysis of the reflectograms collected during the partial discharge measurement \u2013 using a method referred to as [[time domain reflectometry]] (TDR) \u2013 allows the location of insulation irregularities. They are displayed in a partial discharge mapping format.\n\nA phase-related depiction of the partial discharges provides additional information, useful for the evaluation of the device under test.\n\n===Calibration setup===\nThe actual charge change that occurs due to a PD event is not directly measurable, therefore, ''apparent charge'' is used instead. The apparent charge (q) of a PD event is the charge that, if injected between the terminals of the [[device under test]], would change the voltage across the terminals by an amount equivalent to the PD event. This can be modeled by the equation:\n\n:<math>q= C_b \\Delta(V_c)</math>\n\nApparent charge is not equal to the actual amount of changing charge at the PD site, but can be directly measured and calibrated.  'Apparent charge' is usually expressed in pico[[coulomb]]s.\n\nThis is measured by calibrating the voltage of the spikes against the voltages obtained from a calibration unit discharged into the measuring instrument. The calibration unit is quite simple in operation and merely comprises a square wave generator in series with a capacitor connected across the sample. Usually these are triggered optically to enable calibration without entering a dangerous high voltage area. Calibrators are usually disconnected during the discharge testing.\n\n===Laboratory methods===\n* Wideband PD detection circuits\n*:In [[wideband]] [[detection]], the  impedance usually comprises a low [[Q factor|Q]] parallel-resonant [[RLC circuit]]. This circuit tends to attenuate the exciting voltage (usually between 50 and 60 [[hertz|Hz]]) and amplify the voltage generated due to the discharges.\n* Tuned (narrow band) detection circuits\n* Differential discharge bridge methods\n* Acoustic and Ultrasonic methods\n\n===Field testing methods===\nField measurements preclude the use of a [[Faraday cage]] and the energising supply can also be a compromise from the ideal. Field measurements are therefore prone to noise and may be consequently less sensitive.<ref>D. F. Warne ''Advances in high voltage engineering'',  [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|Institution of Electrical Engineers]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-85296-158-8}},  page 166</ref><ref name=\"IEEE\">{{cite book|chapter=Testing Distribution Switchgear for Partial Discharge in the Laboratory and the Field|publisher=[[IEEE]]|date=2008-06-12|doi=10.1109/ELINSL.2008.4570430|isbn=978-1-4244-2091-9|title=Conference Record of the 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation|last1=Davies|first1=N.|last2=Jones|first2=D.|pages=716\u2013719}}</ref>\n\nFactory quality PD tests in the field require equipment that may not be readily available, therefore other methods have been developed for field measurement which, while not as sensitive or accurate as standardized measurements, are substantially more convenient. By necessity field measurements have to be quick, safe and simple if they are to be widely applied by owners and operators of MV and HV assets.\n\n'''Transient Earth Voltages (TEVs)''' are induced voltage spikes on the surface of the surrounding metalwork. TEVs were first discovered in 1974 by Dr John Reeves<ref>Davies, N., Tang, J.C.Y., Shiel, P., (2007), Benefits and Experiences of Non-Intrusive Partial Discharge Measurements on MV Switchgear, CIRED 2007, Paper 0475.</ref> of [http://www.eatechnology.com/ EA Technology]. TEVs occur because the partial discharge creates current spikes in the conductor and hence also in the earthed metal surrounding the conductor. Dr John Reeves established that TEV signals are directly proportional to the condition of the insulation for all switchgear of the same type measured at the same point. TEV readings are measured in dBmV. TEV pulses are full of high frequency components and hence the earthed metalwork presents a considerable impedance to ground. Therefore, voltage spikes are generated. These will stay on the inner surface of surrounding metalwork (to a depth of approximately 0.5&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] in [[mild steel]] at 100&nbsp;MHz) and loop around to the outer surface wherever there is an electrical discontinuity in the metalwork. There is a secondary effect whereby electromagnetic waves generated by the partial discharge also generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork \u2013 the surrounding metalwork acting like an antenna. TEVs are a very convenient phenomenon for measuring and detecting partial discharges as they can be detected without making an electrical connection or removing any panels. While this method may be useful to detect some issues in switchgear and surface tracking on internal components, the sensitivity is not likely to be sufficient to detect issues within solid dielectric cable systems.\n\n'''Ultrasonic''' measurement  relies on fact that the partial discharge will emit sound waves. The frequency for emissions is \"white\" noise in nature and therefore produces ultrasonic structure waves through the solid or liquid filled electrical component. Using a structure borne ultrasonic sensor on the exterior of the item under examination, internal partial discharge can be detected and located when the sensor is placed closest to the source.\n\n'''HFCT Method''' This method is ideal for detecting and determining the severity of the PD by burst interval measurement.  The closer the bursts get to \"zero voltage crossing\" the more severe and critical the PD fault is.  Location of the fault area is accomplished using AE described above.\n\n'''Electro Magnetic Field''' detection picks up the radio waves generated by the partial discharge. As noted before the radio waves can generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork. More sensitive measurement, particularly at higher voltages, can be achieved using in built UHF antennas or external antenna mounted on insulating spacers in the surrounding metalwork.\n\n'''Directional Coupler''' detection picks up the signals emanating from a partial discharge. This method is ideal for joints and accessories, with the sensors being located on the semicon layers at the joint or accessory.<ref>Craatz P., Plath R., Heinrich R., Kalkner W.: Sensitive On-Site PD Measurement and Location using Directional Coupler Sensors in 110kV Prefabricated Joints, 11th ISH99, London, paper 5.317 P5</ref>\n\n==Effects of partial discharge in insulation systems==\nOnce begun, PD causes progressive deterioration of insulating materials, ultimately leading to [[electrical breakdown]]. The effects of PD within [[high voltage]] cables and equipment can be very serious, ultimately leading to complete failure. The cumulative effect of partial discharges within solid dielectrics is the formation of numerous, branching partially conducting discharge channels, a process called [[Electrical treeing|treeing]]. Repetitive discharge events cause irreversible mechanical and chemical deterioration of the insulating material. Damage is caused by the energy dissipated by high energy [[electrons]] or [[ions]], [[ultraviolet light]] from the discharges, ozone attacking the void walls, and cracking as the chemical breakdown processes liberate gases at high pressure. The chemical transformation of the dielectric also tends to increase the electrical conductivity of the dielectric material surrounding the voids. This increases the electrical stress in the (thus far) unaffected gap region, accelerating the breakdown process. A number of inorganic dielectrics, including [[glass]], [[porcelain]], and [[mica]], are significantly more resistant to PD damage than organic and [[polymer]] dielectrics.\n\nIn paper-insulated high-voltage cables, partial discharges begin as small pinholes penetrating the paper windings that are adjacent to the electrical conductor or outer sheath. As PD activity progresses, the repetitive discharges eventually cause permanent chemical changes within the affected paper layers and impregnating dielectric fluid. Over time, partially conducting carbonized trees are formed. This places greater stress on the remaining insulation, leading to further growth of the damaged region, resistive heating along the tree, and further charring (sometimes called ''tracking''). This eventually culminates in the complete dielectric failure of the cable and, typically, an electrical [[explosion]].\n\nPartial discharges dissipate energy in the form of heat, sound, and light. Localized heating from PD may cause thermal degradation of the insulation. Although the level of PD heating is generally low for DC and power line frequencies, it can accelerate failures within high voltage high-frequency equipment. The integrity of insulation in high voltage equipment can be confirmed by monitoring the PD activities that occur through the equipment's life. To ensure supply reliability and long-term operational sustainability, PD in high-voltage electrical equipment should be monitored closely with early warning signals for inspection and maintenance.\n\nPD can usually be prevented through careful design and material selection. In critical high voltage equipment, the integrity of the insulation is confirmed using PD detection equipment during the manufacturing stage as well as periodically through the equipment's useful life. PD prevention and detection are essential to ensure reliable, long-term operation of high voltage equipment used by [[Electrical power industry|electric power utilities]].\n\n==Monitoring partial discharge events in transformers and reactors==\nUtilizing UHF couplers and sensors, partial discharge signals are detected and carried to a master control unit where a filtering process is applied to reject interference. The amplitude and frequency of the UHF partial discharge pulses are digitized, analyzed and processed in order to generate an appropriate partial discharge data output, supervisory control and data acquisition ([[SCADA]]) alarm. Depending on the provider of the system, the partial discharge outputs are accessible through either a local area network, via modem or even a via web-based viewer.\n\n==International standards and informative guides==\n* IEC 60060-2 : 1989 High-voltage test techniques \u2014 Part 2: Measuring systems\n* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60270:2000/[[British Standard|BS]] EN 60270:2001 \"High-Voltage Test Techniques \u2013 Partial Discharge Measurements\"\n* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61934:2006 \"Electrical insulating materials and systems - Electrical measurement of PD under short rise time and repetitive voltage impulses\"\n* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60664-4:2007 \"Insulation coordination for equipment within low-voltage systems \u2013  Part 4: Consideration of high-frequency voltage stress\"\n* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60034-27:2007 \"Rotating electrical machines \u2013 Off-line partial discharge measurements on the stator winding insulation of rotating electrical machines\"\n* [[IEEE]] Std 436\u2122-1991 (R2007) \"IEEE Guide for Making Corona (Partial Discharge) Measurements on Electronics Transformers\"\n* [[IEEE]] 1434\u20132000 \"IEEE Trial-Use Guide to the Measurement of Partial Discharges in Rotating Machinery\"\n* [[IEEE]] 400-2001 \"IEEE Guide for Field Testing and Evaluation of the Insulation of Shielded Power Cable Systems\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[Condition-based maintenance]]\n*[[Condition monitoring]]\n*[[Dissolved gas analysis]]\n*[[Electric generator]]\n*[[Electric motor]]\n*[[Electric power distribution]]\n*[[Electric power transmission]]\n*[[Electrical substation]]\n*[[Electrical treeing]]\n*[[Switchgear]]\n*[[Transformer]]\n* [[Electrostatic discharge]]\n* [[Electrical measurements]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* High Voltage Engineering Fundamentals, E.Kuffel, W.S.

It often starts within gas voids, such as voids in solid epoxy insulation or bubbles in transformer oil. Protracted partial discharge can erode solid insulation and eventually lead to breakdown of insulation.\n\n==Discharge mechanism==\nPD usually begins within voids, cracks, or inclusions within a solid [[dielectric]], at [[Conductor (material)|conductor]]-dielectric interfaces within solid or liquid dielectrics, or in bubbles within liquid [[dielectric]]s.  Since PDs are limited to only a portion of the insulation, the discharges only partially bridge the distance between [[electrodes]]. PD can also occur along the boundary between different insulating materials.\n\n[[File:Partial discharge.svg|thumb|right| A partial discharge within solid insulation. When a spark jumps the gap within the gas-filled void, a small current flows in the conductors, attenuated by the voltage divider network Cx, Cy, Cz in parallel with the bulk capacitance Cb]]\n\nPartial discharges within an insulating material are usually initiated within gas-filled voids within the dielectric. Because the [[dielectric constant]] of the void is considerably less than the surrounding dielectric, the [[electric field]] across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric. If the voltage stress across the void is increased above the [[Corona discharge|corona]] inception voltage (CIV) for the gas within the void, PD activity will start within the void.\n\nPD can also occur along the surface of solid insulating materials if the surface tangential electric field is high enough to cause a breakdown along the insulator surface. This phenomenon commonly manifests itself on overhead line insulators, particularly on contaminated insulators during days of high humidity. Overhead lines  use air as their insulation medium.\n\n===PD equivalent circuit===\nThe equivalent circuit of a dielectric incorporating a cavity can be modeled as a capacitive [[voltage divider]] in parallel with another [[capacitor]]. The upper capacitor of the divider represents the parallel combination of the capacitances in series with the void and the lower capacitor represents the capacitance of the void. The parallel capacitor represents the remaining unvoided capacitance of the sample.\n\n===Partial discharge currents===\nWhenever partial discharge is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave goes through the [[zero crossing]]. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a \"high frequency\" [[current transducer]] which is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested.  The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval between the end of a burst and the beginning of the next burst.  As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2&nbsp;ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure.  The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded.  It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring [[resistor]] in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an [[oscilloscope]] via a matched [[coaxial]] cable.\n\nWhen PD, [[arcing]] or sparking occurs, electromagnetic waves propagate away from the fault site in all directions which contact the transformer tank and travel to earth (ground cable) where the HFCT is located to capture any EMI or EMP within the transformer, breaker, PT, CT, HV Cable, MCSG, LTC, LA, generator, large hv motors, etc. Detection of the high-frequency pulses will identify the existence of partial discharge, arcing or sparking. After PD or arcing is detected, the next step is to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time. Bandpass filtering is used to eliminate interference from system noises.\n\n==Discharge detection and measuring systems==\nWith the partial discharge measurement, the dielectric condition of high voltage equipment can be evaluated, and [[electrical treeing]] in the insulation can be detected and located. Partial discharge measurement can localize the damaged part of an insulated system.\n\nData collected during partial discharge testing is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test or to factory quality control standards. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition (new, strongly aged, faulty) of the device under test and appropriate maintenance and repair measures may be planned and organized in advance.\n\nPartial discharge measurement is applicable  to cables and accessories with various insulation materials, such as [[polyethylene]] or paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable. Partial discharge measurement is routinely carried out to assess the condition of the insulation system of rotating machines (motors and generators), [[transformer]]s, and gas-insulated [[switchgear]].\n\n=== Partial discharge measurement system ===\n\nA partial discharge measurement system basically consists of:\n\n* a cable or other object being tested\n* a coupling capacitor of low inductance design\n* a high-voltage supply with low background noise\n* high-voltage connections\n* a high voltage filter to reduce background noise from the power supply\n* a partial discharge detector\n* PC software for analysis\n\nA partial discharge detection system for in-service, energized electric power equipment:\n* a cable, transformer, or any MV/HV power equipment\n* Ultra High Frequency Sensor (UHF) Detection Bandwidth 300&nbsp;MHz-1.5Ghz\n* High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) Bandwidth 500&nbsp;kHz-50&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Ultrasonic transducer|Ultrasonic microphone]] with center frequency 40&nbsp;kHz\n* Acoustic Contact Sensor with detection bandwidth 20&nbsp;kHz - 300&nbsp;kHz\n* TEV sensor or coupling capacitor  3&nbsp;MHz-100&nbsp;MHz\n* Phase-resolved analysis system to compare pulse timing to AC frequency\n\n=== The principle of partial discharge measurement ===\nA number of discharge detection schemes and partial discharge measurement methods have been invented since the importance of PD was realised early in the last century. Partial discharge currents tend to be of short duration and have rise times in the [[nanosecond]] realm. On an [[oscilloscope]], the discharges appear as evenly spaced burst events that occur at the peak of the sinewave. Random events are arcing or sparking.\nThe usual way of quantifying partial discharge magnitude is in pico[[coulomb]]s. The intensity of partial discharge is displayed versus time.\n\nAn automatic analysis of the reflectograms collected during the partial discharge measurement \u2013 using a method referred to as [[time domain reflectometry]] (TDR) \u2013 allows the location of insulation irregularities. They are displayed in a partial discharge mapping format.\n\nA phase-related depiction of the partial discharges provides additional information, useful for the evaluation of the device under test.\n\n===Calibration setup===\nThe actual charge change that occurs due to a PD event is not directly measurable, therefore, ''apparent charge'' is used instead. The apparent charge (q) of a PD event is the charge that, if injected between the terminals of the [[device under test]], would change the voltage across the terminals by an amount equivalent to the PD event. This can be modeled by the equation:\n\n:<math>q= C_b \\Delta(V_c)</math>\n\nApparent charge is not equal to the actual amount of changing charge at the PD site, but can be directly measured and calibrated.  'Apparent charge' is usually expressed in pico[[coulomb]]s.\n\nThis is measured by calibrating the voltage of the spikes against the voltages obtained from a calibration unit discharged into the measuring instrument. The calibration unit is quite simple in operation and merely comprises a square wave generator in series with a capacitor connected across the sample. Usually these are triggered optically to enable calibration without entering a dangerous high voltage area. Calibrators are usually disconnected during the discharge testing.\n\n===Laboratory methods===\n* Wideband PD detection circuits\n*:In [[wideband]] [[detection]], the  impedance usually comprises a low [[Q factor|Q]] parallel-resonant [[RLC circuit]]. This circuit tends to attenuate the exciting voltage (usually between 50 and 60 [[hertz|Hz]]) and amplify the voltage generated due to the discharges.\n* Tuned (narrow band) detection circuits\n* Differential discharge bridge methods\n* Acoustic and Ultrasonic methods\n\n===Field testing methods===\nField measurements preclude the use of a [[Faraday cage]] and the energising supply can also be a compromise from the ideal. Field measurements are therefore prone to noise and may be consequently less sensitive.<ref>D. F.

By necessity field measurements have to be quick, safe and simple if they are to be widely applied by owners and operators of MV and HV assets.\n\n'''Transient Earth Voltages (TEVs)''' are induced voltage spikes on the surface of the surrounding metalwork. TEVs were first discovered in 1974 by Dr John Reeves<ref>Davies, N., Tang, J.C.Y., Shiel, P., (2007), Benefits and Experiences of Non-Intrusive Partial Discharge Measurements on MV Switchgear, CIRED 2007, Paper 0475.</ref> of [http://www.eatechnology.com/ EA Technology]. TEVs occur because the partial discharge creates current spikes in the conductor and hence also in the earthed metal surrounding the conductor. Dr John Reeves established that TEV signals are directly proportional to the condition of the insulation for all switchgear of the same type measured at the same point. TEV readings are measured in dBmV. TEV pulses are full of high frequency components and hence the earthed metalwork presents a considerable impedance to ground. Therefore, voltage spikes are generated. These will stay on the inner surface of surrounding metalwork (to a depth of approximately 0.5&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] in [[mild steel]] at 100&nbsp;MHz) and loop around to the outer surface wherever there is an electrical discontinuity in the metalwork. There is a secondary effect whereby electromagnetic waves generated by the partial discharge also generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork \u2013 the surrounding metalwork acting like an antenna. TEVs are a very convenient phenomenon for measuring and detecting partial discharges as they can be detected without making an electrical connection or removing any panels. While this method may be useful to detect some issues in switchgear and surface tracking on internal components, the sensitivity is not likely to be sufficient to detect issues within solid dielectric cable systems.\n\n'''Ultrasonic''' measurement  relies on fact that the partial discharge will emit sound waves. The frequency for emissions is \"white\" noise in nature and therefore produces ultrasonic structure waves through the solid or liquid filled electrical component. Using a structure borne ultrasonic sensor on the exterior of the item under examination, internal partial discharge can be detected and located when the sensor is placed closest to the source.\n\n'''HFCT Method''' This method is ideal for detecting and determining the severity of the PD by burst interval measurement.  The closer the bursts get to \"zero voltage crossing\" the more severe and critical the PD fault is.  Location of the fault area is accomplished using AE described above.\n\n'''Electro Magnetic Field''' detection picks up the radio waves generated by the partial discharge. As noted before the radio waves can generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork. More sensitive measurement, particularly at higher voltages, can be achieved using in built UHF antennas or external antenna mounted on insulating spacers in the surrounding metalwork.\n\n'''Directional Coupler''' detection picks up the signals emanating from a partial discharge.

The machines in the Color Computer line are not compatible with software made for the earlier TRS-80.{{r|byte198103}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TRS-80 Videotex terminal retouched.jpg|thumb|250px|The TRS-80 VideoTex Terminal, circa 1980]]\n\n[[Tandy Corporation]] announced the TRS-80 Color Computer in July 1980 to compete with the inexpensive and popular [[Commodore VIC-20]].<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: It all started 10 years ago in a converted used-car showroom... |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n51 |magazine=80 Micro |pages=50\u201364 |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It began as a joint venture between Tandy and [[Motorola]] Semiconductor, Inc. of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], to develop a low-cost home computer in 1977.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe initial goal of this project, called \"Green Thumb\", was to create a low cost [[Videotex]] terminal for farmers, ranchers, and others in the agricultural industry.<ref name=\"GreenThumb\">{{Cite book|last1=G.

Unfortunately, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola solved this problem by integrating all the functions of the many smaller chips into one chip, the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM). By that time in late 1979, the new and powerful Motorola [[Motorola 6809|MC6809]] processor was released. The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were combined and the AgVision terminal was born.\n\nThe AgVision terminal was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980. Internal differences, if any, are unclear, as not many AgVision terminals survive to this day.<ref name=\"ElencoAgVision\">{{cite news | url=https://vintagecomputer.ca/agvision-videotex-terminal/ | title=AgVision Videotex terminal | work=Vintage Computer | date=2016-12-22 | accessdate=16 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nWith its proven design, the VideoTex terminal contains all the basic components for a general-purpose home computer. The internal [[modem]] was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and [[ROM cartridge|program cartridges]] (\"Program Paks\"), and a RAM button (a sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine) covers the hole where the Modem's LED \"DATA\" indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer. Sharing the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals, at first glance it would be hard to tell the TRS-80 Color Computer from its predecessors.\n\nTandy viewed businesses as its primary market for computers. Although the company's Ed Juge said in 1981 that the Color Computer was \"our entry into the home-computer market\", he described it as \"for serious professionals\", stating that a word processor and spreadsheet would soon be available.<ref name=\"freibergerfuture19810831\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Radio Shack Prepares for the Future | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-08-31 | accessdate=26 October 2016 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=51, 53\u201354}}</ref> In 1987 Tandy CEO John Roach refused to describe it as a home computer.{{r|white198708}} The initial model (catalog number 26-3001) shipped with 4 KB of [[Dynamic Random Access Memory]] (DRAM) and an {{nowrap|8 kB [[Microsoft BASIC]]}} interpreter in [[Read-only memory|ROM]].

For a time, the CoCo was referred to internally as the TRS-90 in reference to the \"9\" in \"6809\".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, this was dropped and all CoCos sold as Radio Shack computers were called TRS-80 in spite of the processor change.\n\nThe CoCo is incompatible with all software for other Tandy computers.{{r|green198212}} Like its Z80-based predecessors, the CoCo shipped with a version of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]. Tandy licensed [[Microsoft BASIC]]; as with the Z80 systems, there are multiple levels of BASIC. The original CoCo offered standard [[Color BASIC]] and Extended Color BASIC. This was further extended by a Disk Extended Color BASIC ROM included in the floppy controller. The CoCo 3 included Super Extended Color BASIC as standard, deploying extensions added by [[Microware]]. Third-party floppy controller ROMs, such as J&M System JDOS, and DSS Peripherals Disk Controller, enabled the use of double-sided disk drives.\n\nThe CoCo BASIC offered a number of advanced sound, graphics, and program control features many of which would also appear in IBM PC-compatible versions of Microsoft BASIC, these included statements for playing musical notes and drawing graphics primitives. These advanced features were possible on the 8-bit CoCo because 6809 machine language was more code-dense than Z80 or 6502 machine language, thus more features could be packed into a relatively small BASIC ROM.\n\nThe CoCo is designed to be attached to a color television set, whereas the Z80 machines use monochrome [[computer monitor]]s, often built into the case. The CoCo also features an expansion connector for program cartridges (mostly games, although the EDTASM assembler is a cartridge) and other expansion devices, such as floppy-disk controllers and modems. Tandy released a Multi-Pak Interface which allowed switching quickly among four cartridges. This is similar in concept to the Model I's Expansion Interface.\n\nThe CoCo did not have internally-mounted disk drives and instead reverted to the TRS-80 Model I setup with separate external drives in a daisy chain, each unit requiring a separate wall outlet for power. The original drives offered with the CoCo were 35-track TEC units instead of the more expensive 40 track Tandon drives in the Model III\u2014they had a formatted capacity of 160K.\n\nThe floppy controller consisted of a cartridge that plugged into the side cartridge slot which contained the controller circuitry (based on the WD1791) and a ROM with Disk Extended Color BASIC. It was similar to [[Commodore International|Commodore]] disk drives in that the DOS was ROM-based and not a distinct entity from BASIC, however, unlike Commodore DOS, it occupied the main CPU's address space. The disk controller required Extended Color BASIC to work, so it was not compatible with original CoCo 1s that had Color BASIC.\n\nEven with the add-on floppy drive, the CoCo did not have a true DOS until third-party operating systems such as TSC [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX9]] (distributed for the CoCo by Frank Hogg Laboratories) and [[Microware]]'s multi-user, multi-tasking [[OS-9]] were available. However, a disk-based CoCo does contain Disk Extended Color BASIC on an internal ROM in the controller cartridge that gives the BASIC user the ability to save and load programs from the disk and store and retrieve data from disk in various ways.\n\nWhile Z80-based TRS-80s had industry-standard Centronics and RS-232 interfaces, the CoCo instead had a proprietary serial interface with a round DIN connector similar to the Commodore IEC interface for connecting a printer or modem (as there was only one serial port, it was not possible to have both connected at the same time and the user would have to switch between the printer or modem). Most of Radio Shack's printer line sported a connector for the CoCo's serial port in addition to a normal Centronics port.\n\nFor users without disk drives, the CoCo retained the same audio cassette interface as the Model I/III, using a DIN plug with audio in/out and motor control jacks, any standard portable cassette recorder and audio cassettes could be used with it (hi-fi tape decks and metal cassettes were not recommended).\n\nThe CoCo also had two joystick ports, the joysticks are analog devices with potentiometers similar to the Apple II's joysticks rather than the digital-style Atari sticks. The same ports also found their way onto the IBM-compatible Tandy 1000 line.\n\nSome non-program expansion cartridges include a sound/voice synthesizer (which led to the CoCo being used as an accessibility device for the disabled),<ref>{{cite news | title=Speaking Up for the Handicapped | work=Hot CoCo | date=December 1985 | author=Vassilopoulous, Charles A. | pages=51}}</ref> 300-baud modem pack, an RS232 pack (the internal serial port was merely one bit of a parallel port), a hard-drive controller, stereo-music adapter, floppy-disk controller, input tablet, and other accessories. Some of this hardware was designed and marketed by third-party mail-order houses, including a \"Disto Super Controller\" (a floppy controller, with space for an optional serial port or SCSI interface in the same enclosure). The CoCo was the first Tandy computer to have a [[computer mouse|mouse]] available for it; instead of following the IBM PC/Microsoft standard, this mouse was electrically the equivalent of an analogue joystick.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Versions==\nThere were three versions of the Color Computer:\n\n===Color Computer 1 (1980\u20131983) {{anchor|coco1}}===\n[[Image:TRS-80 Color Computer 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|4K TRS-80 Color Computer from 1981, 26-3001]]\n\nThe original version of the Color Computer sported a large silver-gray case with a calculator-like \"[[chiclet keyboard]]\", and was available with memory sizes of 4K (26-3001), 16K (26-3002), or 32K (26-3003). Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard [[Microsoft]] Color [[Microsoft BASIC|Basic]] or (optionally) Extended Color Basic. It used a regular TV for display, and TV out was the only available connection to a display device.\n\nThe early versions of the CoCo 1 had a black keyboard surround, the TRS-80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side, and a RAM badge (\"button\") affixed on the top and right side of the case. Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button, and moved the TRS-80 nameplate to the mid-line of the case.\n\nThe computer was based on a single [[printed-circuit board]], with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consisted of 2104 (4Kx1) chips (4K models) or 4116 (16Kx1) chips (16K models).{{r|byte198103}} The early CoCos only had eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32K requiring piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few jumper wires. A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with \"half-bad\" 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good, in addition, they removed the -5V and -12V power lines used by the older DRAM types. This was transparent to the BASIC programmer since in either configuration 32K of memory was available. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s were shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips; many utilities and programs began to take advantage of the \"hidden\" 32K.\n\nUsers opening the case risked invalidating the warranty.{{r|byte198103}} Radio Shack could upgrade all versions that shipped with standard Color BASIC to Extended Color BASIC, developed by Microsoft, for $99. ''BYTE'' wrote in 1981 that through Extended Color BASIC, Radio Shack \"has released the first ''truly'' easy-to-use and inexpensive system that generates full-color graphics\".<ref name=\"miastkowski198105\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-05/1981_05_BYTE_06-05_Software_Piracy#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Extended Color BASIC for the TRS-80 Color Computer | work=BYTE | date=May 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Miastkowski, Stan | pages=37}}</ref> Eventually the 32K memory option was dropped entirely and only 16K or 64K versions were offered.\n\nIn late 1982, a version of the Color Computer with a white case, called the TDP System 100, was distributed by [[RCA]] and sold through non-Tandy stores. Except for the nameplate and case, it was identical to the Color Computer.<ref name=\"rainbow198209\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/rainbowmagazine-1982-09/The_Rainbow_Magazine_09_1982#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Pipeline | work=The Rainbow | date=September 1982 | accessdate=17 October 2013 | pages=56}}</ref>\n\nAt some point after this, both the Coco and the TDP System 100 shipped with a white case which had ventilation slots that ran the entire length of the case, rather than only on the sides. This ventilation scheme was carried over to the CoCo 2. Some late versions of the CoCo also shipped with a modified keyboard, often referred to as the \"melted\" keyboard, which had bigger keycaps but a similar rubbery feel.\n\nA number of peripherals were available: tape cassette storage, serial printers, a 5.25&nbsp;inch floppy disk drive, a pen and graphics tablet called the \"X-Pad\", speech and sound generators, and joysticks.\n\n{{Gallery\n|width=250\n|lines=2\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1 4x3.jpg|16K TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1 ports.jpg|I/O ports and cartridge slot on the TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1-white case.jpg|Late \"white\" model TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TDP-100 wb.jpg|Tandy Data Products TDP-100 (64K badge was added by user)\n}}\n\n===Color Computer 2 (1983\u20131986) {{anchor|coco2}}===\n[[Image:TRS-80 Color Computer 2-64K.jpg|thumb|250px|Final production 64K Tandy Color Computer 2, showing full-travel keyboard (26-3127B)]]\n\nDuring the initial CoCo 1 production run, much of the discrete support circuitry had been re-engineered into a handful of custom integrated circuits, leaving much of the circuit board area of the CoCo 1 as empty space. To cut production costs, the case was shortened by about 25% and a new, smaller power supply and motherboard were designed. The \"melted\" keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP-100 style ventilation slots were carried over. Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector, the computer was essentially 100% compatible with the previous generation. The deletion of the 12V power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller, which then needed to be upgraded, installed in a Multi-Pak interface, or supplied with external power.\n\nThe CoCo 2 was offered in either 16K or 64K models (there was no 32K CoCo 2).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} 16K models use 16Kx1 DRAMs, but the chips are not the common 4116; they are instead 6665 chips (Radio Shack P/N 8040517), which uses only +5V power rather than the triple voltages used by the 4116. 64K models use standard 4164 chips.\n\n64K models of the CoCo 2 have a control register at $FFDE/$FFDF used to switch between the second 32K of RAM and the OS ROMs. If the ROMs were banked out, the entire 64K of system RAM could be accessed.\n\nProduction was also partially moved to Korea during the CoCo 2's life-span, and many owners of the Korean-built systems referred to them as \"KoKos\". Production in the US and Korea happened in parallel using the same part numbers; very few, if any, differences exist between the USA built and Korean built CoCo 2 machines.\n\nUpgraded BASIC ROMs were also produced, adding a few minor features and correcting some bugs. A redesigned 5-volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM (v1.1). The new controller also added a new command, \"DOS\", which allowed software to be auto-booted from disk (this required a disk that had a specially set up boot sector). It facilitated the use of software on copy protected disks or third-party operating systems, chiefly OS-9.\n\nLater in the production run, the \"melted\" keyboard was replaced with a new, full-travel, typewriter-style keyboard.\n\nThe final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 was made for the models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B (16 KB standard, 16 KB extended, and 64 KB extended respectively). Internally this model was redesigned to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1. This enhanced VDG allowed the use of lower case characters and the ability to change the text screen border color. For compatibility reasons neither of these features were used and were not enabled in BASIC, however the resourceful user could enable them by setting certain memory registers. Midway during the production run of these final CoCo 2s, the nameplate was changed from \"Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2\" to \"Tandy Color Computer 2\". The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.\n\n''[[Creative Computing]]'' wrote in December 1984 that the Color Computer was the best educational computer under $1000.

It came with {{nowrap|128\nKB of RAM,}} which could be upgraded to 512 KB. The keyboard surround and cartridge door plastic were changed from black to grey. The keyboard layout was revised, putting the arrow keys in a diamond configuration and adding CTRL, ALT, F1 and F2 keys. It sold in Radio Shack stores and Tandy Computer Centers for $219.95 (199 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in Canada later that year).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sims|first1=Calvin|title=5 Models Introduced By Tandy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/31/business/5-models-introduced-by-tandy.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|date=31 July 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe CoCo 3 was compatible with most older software and CoCo 2 peripherals. Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware in the CoCo 1 and 2 was an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] called the \"GIME\" (Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancement) chip. The GIME also provided additional features:\n* Output to a composite video monitor or analog RGB monitor, in addition to the CoCo 1 and 2's TV output. This did much to improve the clarity of its output.\n* A paged [[memory management unit]] broke up the 6809's 64 KB address space into {{nowrap|8 \u00d7 8 KB}} chunks.

Instead, [[Microware]] provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes. In order to not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy, Microsoft's unmodified BASIC software was loaded in the CoCo 3's ROM. Upon startup, the ROM is copied to RAM and then patched by Microware's code. The composite basic produced was not without some flaws: the patched code had several bugs, and support for many of the new hardware features was incomplete.\n\nMicroware also provided a version of the [[OS-9]] Level 2 operating system shortly after launch. This OS featured memory-mapping (so each process had its own memory space up to 64K), windowed display, and a more extensive development environment that included a bundled copy of [[BASIC09]]. [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compilers were available. Various members of the CoCo OS-9 community enhanced OS-9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy's request, but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released. Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS-9, a major rewrite of OS-9/6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the added features and speed of the [[Hitachi 6309]] (if the unit has the Hitachi CPU installed).<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nitros9.org\n  |title = NitrOS-9 operating system for the Tandy/Radio Shack Color Computer\n  |accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  |date =\n  |work =\n  |publisher =\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:CoCo3system.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical CoCo 3 system]]\nThe 6809 in the CoCo 1 and 2 ran at 0.895&nbsp;MHz; the CoCo 3 runs at that frequency by default, but is software controllable to run at twice that rate; [[OS-9]] takes advantage of that capability.\n\nA popular accessory was a high-resolution joystick adapter designed by CoCo enthusiast [[Steve Bjork]]. While it did increase the resolution of the joystick/mouse interface by a factor of ten, it did so at the expense of CPU time. A modified version of this interface was included with a software package by Colorware called CoCo-Max 3, by Dave Stamp. This was a [[MacPaint]] work-alike but added support for color graphics. This was a very desirable product for CoCo owners and combined with a MacWrite-like word processor called MAX-10 (also by Dave Stamp and internally named \"MaxWrite\"), provided some of the functionality of an [[Apple Macintosh]], but with color graphics and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhile the CoCo 3 featured many enhancements and was well received, it was not without problems and disappointments. As initially conceived, the CoCo 3 had much hardware acceleration and enhanced sound; these capabilities were scaled back due to aggressive cost-cutting and internal politics crippled the design so it would not be perceived as a threat to the Tandy 1000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This again limited the platform's potential as a game console. Early versions of the GIME had DRAM timing issues which caused random freezes. Due to bugs in the GIME some features that were problematic were marked as \"reserved\" or \"do not use\" in the programming and service manuals.\n\nThe power supply was marginal, and some would overheat if the system memory was expanded to the full {{nowrap|512 KB}} capacity due to the considerable heat generated by the additional RAM on the optional daughterboard. Some CoCo 3 owners opted to add a small fan inside the case to keep it cool.\n\n==Hardware design and integrated circuits==\nInternally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical. The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] chips:\n* MC6809E Microprocessor Unit (MPU)\n* MC6883/SN74LS783/SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor (SAM)\n* [[Motorola 6847|MC6847]] [[Video Display Generator]] (VDG)\n* Two [[Peripheral Interface Adapter]]s (PIA), either MC6821 or MC6822 chips\n\n===SAM===\nThe SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions:\n* Clock generation and synchronization for the 6809E MPU and 6847 VDG\n* Up to 64K Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) control and refresh\n* Device selection based on MPU memory address to determine if the MPU access is to DRAM, ROM, PIA, etc.\n* Duplication of the VDG address counter to \"feed\" the VDG the data it is expecting\n\nThe SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS/TTL chips into one integrated package. Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but, as outlined above, it integrates several other functions as well. It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency (14.31818&nbsp;MHz for NTSC countries). This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing (3.579545&nbsp;MHz for NTSC). The SAM also divides the master clock by 16 (or 8 in certain cases) for the [[two-phase clock|two phase MPU clock]]; in NTSC this is .89&nbsp;MHz (or 1.8&nbsp;MHz if divided by 8).\n\nSwitching the SAM into 1.8&nbsp;MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh. As such, the display shows garbage; this mode was seldom used. However, an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode, where ROM reads (since they do not use the DRAM) occur at 1.8&nbsp;MHz but regular RAM access occurs at .89&nbsp;MHz. In effect, since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM, putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh. Of course, this would throw off the software timing loops and I/O operations would be affected. Despite this, however, the \"high speed [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]\" was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it [[overclocking|overclocked]] the hardware in the CoCo, which was only rated for 1&nbsp;MHz operation.\n\nThe SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, Writing to odd bytes sets it to 1.\n\nDue to limitations in 40 pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG's internal 12-bit address counter. Normally this counter's settings are set to duplicate the VDG's display mode. However, this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is \"fed\" data by the SAM's internal copy of the VDG address counter. This process is called \"Interleaved Direct Memory Access\" (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.\n\nThere are two versions of the SAM. The early one is labeled MC6883 and/or SN74LS783; the later version is labeled SN74LS785. There are some minor timing differences, but the major difference is the support of an 8-bit refresh counter in the 785 version. This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4-bit and certain 64K by 1-bit DRAMs. Some third-party bank-switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8-bit refresh counter to work.\n\n===VDG===\n[[Image:Coco2boot.png|thumb|320px|Power-on screen of a CoCo 2]]\nThe MC6847 is display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high. It can display 9 colors: black, green, yellow, blue, red, buff (almost-but-not-quite white), cyan, magenta, and orange.\n\n====Alphanumeric/Semigraphics display====\n[[Image:Cocobvdg.png|thumb|320px|Sample character set display of 6847 VDG]]\nThe CoCo is physically wired such that its default alphanumeric display is actually \"Semigraphics 4\" mode.\n\nIn alphanumeric mode, each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high. This display mode occupies 512 bytes of memory from $400-$5FF and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines. The internal ROM character generator only holds 64 characters, so no lower case characters are provided. Lower case characters were rendered as upper case characters with inverted color. Although simulated screen shots would show this as green on black, on most CoCo generations it was actually green on very dark green.\n\nSemigraphics is a hybrid display mode where alphanumerics and chunky block graphics can be mixed together on the same screen. If the 8th bit of the character is set, it is a semigraphics character. If cleared, it is an alphanumeric. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits determine which \"quadrant\" of the character box is either the selected color or black. This is the only mode where it is possible (without sneaky tricks) to display all 9 colors on the screen simultaneously. If used to only display semigraphics, the screen becomes a 64\u00d732 nine color graphics mode. The CoCo features several BASIC commands to manage this screen as a low-res graphics display.\n\nThe alphanumeric display has two colorsets. The one used by default on the CoCo has black characters on a green background. The alternate has black characters on an orange background. The colorset selection does not affect semigraphics characters. The border in this mode is always black.\n\nThe 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1/6 of the character box is lit. In this mode only 4 colors are possible but the Colorset bit of the VDG can select two different groups of the 4 colors. Due to a peculiarity of its hardware, only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.<ref>[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/semigraphics.html Semi-graphics-6 display mode], By Bill Yakowenko, 25-Mar-1996, Color Computer stuff - Classic Computers, Cs.unc.edu</ref>\n\n====Additional Semigraphics modes====\nBy setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces. This creates the \"virtual\" modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24.<ref>[http://www.lomont.org/Software/Misc/CoCo/Lomont_CoCoHardware.pdf Chris Lomont's Color Computer 1/2/3 Hardware Programming]</ref> In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.\n\nA programmer's reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy's research lab, the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled, and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented. CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes, and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation.<ref><!--[http://home.att.net/~robert.gault/Coco/History/Semi24.htm Semigraphics24 for the Coco1&2. Machine language program to create 8 true colors plus text on screen at one time.]-->[http://aaronwolfe.com/robert.gault/Coco/History/History_files/Semi24.html The Forgotten Graphics Mode Semigraphics-24], By Robert Gault, Date: Feb 10, 2010, What's In a Name? Coco ? It Sure Ain't Hot Chocolate</ref>\n\n====Graphics display====\nThere were several bitmap display modes, which were divided into two categories: \"resolution\" graphics and \"color\" graphics. In resolution modes, each pixel is addressable as either on or off. There are two colorsets available, the first was black dots on a green background and green border, the second, more commonly used one has white dots on a black background with a white border. In color modes, each pixel was two bits, selecting one of four colors. Again the colorset input to the VDG determined which colors were used. The first colorset has a green border, and the colors green, yellow, red, and blue were available. The second colorset has a white border and the colors white, cyan, magenta and orange were available. Resolution graphics have 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, 128\u00d7192, and 256\u00d7192 densities. Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64\u00d764, 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, and 128\u00d7192 densities. The maximum size of a bitmap screen is 6144 bytes beginning at $600 (cassette systems) or $E00 (disk systems).\n\n====Artifact colors====\nThe 256\u00d7192 two color graphics mode uses four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system (see [[composite artifact colors]]). \nIt is not possible to reliably display 256 dots across the screen due to the limitations of the NTSC signal and the phase relationship between the VDG clock and colorburst frequency.\n\nIn the first colorset, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black are not distinct and appear as a muddy green color. However, when one switches to the white and black colorset, instead of a muddy gray as expected, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots will give the opposite color. In effect this mode becomes a 128\u00d7192 4 color graphics mode where black, orange, blue, and white are available (the [[Apple II]] created color graphics by exploiting a similar effect).\n\nMost CoCo games used this mode as the colors available are more useful than the ones provided in the hardware 4 color modes. Unfortunately the VDG internally can power up on either the rising or falling edge of the clock, so the bit patterns that represent orange and blue are not predictable. Most CoCo games would start up with a title screen and invited the user to press the reset button until the colors were correct. The CoCo 3 fixed the clock-edge problem so it was always the same; a user would hold the F1 key during reset to choose the other color set.\n\nOn a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact; to see them one would have to use a TV or composite monitor, or patch the games to use the hardware 128\u00d7192 four color mode in which the GIME chip allows the color choices to be mapped. Users in [[PAL]] countries saw green and purple stripes instead of solid red and blue colors.\n\nReaders of ''[[The Rainbow (magazine)|The Rainbow]]'' or ''Hot CoCo'' magazine learned that they could use some POKE commands to switch the 6847 VDG into one of the artifact modes, while Extended Color Basic continued to operate as though it were still displaying one of the 128\u00d7192 four-color modes. Thus, the entire set of Extended Color Basic graphics commands could be used with the artifact colors. Some users went on to develop a set of 16 artifact colors{{how|date=October 2012}} using a 4\u00d72 pixel matrix, giving this set of colors: black, dark cyan, brick red, light violet, dark blue, azure (the blue above), olive green, brown, purple, light blue, orange, yellow, light gray, blue-white, pink-white, and white. Use of POKE commands also made these colors available to the graphics commands, although the colors had to be drawn one horizontal line at a time. Some interesting artworks were produced from these effects, especially since the CoCo Max art package provided them in its palette of colors.\n\n====Lower case and the 6847T1====\n[[Image:Coco2bvdg lc.png|thumb|320px|Sample character set display of 6847T1 VDG in true lowercase mode]]\nThe 6847 is capable of using an external character generator. Several third-party add-on adapter boards would allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters.\n\nVery late in the CoCo 2 production run, an enhanced VDG was available. Called the 6847T1, it included a lower case character generator and the ability to display a green/orange or black border on the text screen. Its other changes were mainly to reduce parts count by incorporating an internal data latch. The lower case capability of this VDG is not enabled by default on this system and is not even mentioned in the manual. Only through some tinkering and research was this feature discovered by intrepid CoCo users.\n\nThe 6847T1 may also carry the part number XC80652P; these may have been pre-release parts.\n\n===PIAs===\nThere are two PIA chips in all CoCo models. The PIAs are dedicated mainly to I/O operations such as driving the internal 6-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC), reading the status of the DAC's voltage comparator, controlling the relay for the cassette motor, reading the keyboard matrix, controlling the VDG mode control pins, reading and writing to the RS232 serial I/O port, and controlling the internal analog multiplexers.\n\nThe earliest CoCo models had two standard 6821 chips. Later, due to changes in the keyboard design, it was found that the 6822 IIA (industrial interface adapter) was better suited to the keyboard's [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola but was produced for Tandy as an ASIC with a special Tandy part number, SC67331P. Functionally the 6821 and 6822 are identical and one can put a 6821 in place of the 6822 if that part is bad. Some external pull-up resistors may be needed to use a 6821 to replace a 6822 in a CoCo for normal keyboard operation.\n\n===Interface to external peripherals===\nDue to the CoCo's design, the MPU encounters no wait states in normal operation. This means that precise software controlled timing loops are easily implemented. This is important since the CoCo has no specialized hardware for any I/O. All I/O operations, such as cassette reading and writing, serial I/O, scanning the keyboard, and reading the position of the joysticks, must be done entirely in software. This reduces hardware cost but reduces system performance as the MPU is unavailable during these operations.\n\nAs an example, the CoCo cassette interface is perhaps one of the fastest available (1500-bit/s) but it does so entirely under software control. While reading or writing a cassette the CoCo has no CPU time free for other tasks. They must wait until an error occurs or all the data needed is read.\n\n===CoCo 3 hardware changes===\nThe hardware in the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models was functionally the same; the only differences were in packaging and integration of some functions into small ASICs. In the CoCo 3, a new VLSI ASIC called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME), integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both. The CoCo 3 supports 40 and 80 column text displays and the ability to run at 1.8&nbsp;MHz without loss of video. The processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21, which are 2&nbsp;MHz parts.\n\n==Discontinuation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nOn October 26, 1990, Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line.\n\n[[Wayne Green]] wrote in ''[[80 Micro]]'' in December 1982 that Tandy had \"virtually abandoned\" the Color Computer. As with its other computers Tandy attempted to monopolize hardware and software sales, but, he wrote, the Color Computer was incompatible with other Tandy software and what was available was of poor quality. \"I'm sure there are at least fifty software firms out there that would love to work with the Shack\", Green said, but \"it seems that the Shack people are at war with their supporters and potential suppliers\".<ref name=\"green198212\">{{Cite magazine |last=Green |first=Wayne |date=December 1982 |title=Is the Shack in real trouble? |url=https://archive.org/details/80_Micro_1982-12_1001001_US/page/n7/mode/2up |magazine=80 Micro |type=editorial |pages=8,10,12 |access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nMost current and former CoCo owners agree<ref name=\"Tandy Coco Sales\">{{cite book|last1=G.

RadioShack fliers and stores typically depicted the CoCo 3 running CoCo 2 games, and offered a very limited selection of CoCo 3-specific software. There was an official RadioShack store demo,<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://nitros9.lcurtisboyle.com/radioshackdemo.html\n |title       = Official Radio Shack Coco 3 Demo\n |accessdate  = 2008-06-11\n |author      = L.

Very few stores displayed a 512K machine or a CoCo 3 running such games as ''[[King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human|King's Quest III]]'' or ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards|Leisure Suit Larry]]''. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Successors===\nIn spite of Tandy's apparent lack of concern for the CoCo market, there were rumors of the existence of a prototype {{nowrap|CoCo 4}} at Tandy's Fort Worth headquarters. Several first-hand accounts of the prototype came from people like Mark Siegel of Tandy and Ken Kaplan of Microware. In 2013, evidence surfaced that Tandy at least had considered the idea of a CoCo 4, when a prototype case appeared in the book \"CoCo: The Colorful History of Tandy's Underdog Computer.\" That case is now in the hands of a collector.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA few independent companies attempted to carry the CoCo torch, but the lack of decent backwards compatibility with the {{nowrap|CoCo 3}} failed to entice much of the CoCo community over to these new independent platforms. Many of these independent platforms did run OS9/68k, which was very similar to [[OS-9]]. However, the bulk of the CoCo community moved on to more mainstream platforms. Some CoCo users swore their loyalty to Motorola and moved on to the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and the [[Macintosh]], all of which were based on the [[Motorola 68000]] processor. Others jumped to the IBM PC-compatible.\n\n;Tomcat\nFrank Hogg Labs introduced the Tomcat TC-9 in June 1990, which was somewhat compatible with the {{nowrap|CoCo 3,}} but was mostly only able to run [[OS-9]] software. A later version called the TC-70 (running on a Signetics 68070) had strong compatibility with the MM/1, and also ran OS-9/68K.\n\n;MM/1\nThe ''Multi-Media One'' was introduced in July 1990, ran [[OS-9]]/68K on a 15&nbsp;MHz Signetics 68070 processor with {{nowrap|3 MB RAM,}} and had a 640\u00d7208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640\u00d7416 interlaced mode. It included a [[SCSI]] interface, stereo A/D and D/A conversion, an optional [[MIDI]] interface, and (later) an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a [[MC68340|Motorola 68340]] running at up to 25&nbsp;MHz. It is estimated that about 500 units were sold.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n;AT306\nThe AT306 (also known as the MM/1B) was a successor to the MM/1 that contained a Motorola 68306 CPU, OS-9/68K 3.0, and was designed to allow the use of [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus cards. It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider, and sold by Carl's company, Kreider Electronics.  It was also sold as the \"WCP-306\" by Bill Wittman of Wittman Computer Products.\n\n;Delmar System IV/Peripheral Technology PT68K-4\nPeripheral Technology produced a 16&nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 system called a PTK68K-4, which was sold as a kit or a complete motherboard. Delmar sold complete systems based on the PT68K-4 and called the ''Delmar System IV''. The PT68K-4 has the footprint of an IBM PC, so it will fit in a normal PC case, and it has seven 8-bit ISA slots. Video was provided by a standard IBM style monochrome, [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] video card and monitor, but for high-resolution graphics the software only supported certain [[Tseng Labs ET4000|ET4000]] video cards. It appears that most users of this system use/used [[OS-9]], but there are several operating systems for it, including REX (a FLEX-like OS), and SK*DOS. Dan Farnsworth, who wrote REX, also wrote a BASIC interpreter that was fairly compatible to DECB, but it was too little, too late to be of interest to many CoCo users. There was also a card available called an ALT86, which was basically an [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]] compatible computer on a card, which allowed the user to run DOS programs on it. In fact, both the 68000 and the ALT86 card could be run at the same time, if access to the ISA bus was not needed from the 68000 side of it.\n\n;CoCo3FPGA\nGary Becker produced a broadly compatible version of the CoCo3 with enhancements called the [http://www.retr09.com/wiki/CoCo3FPGA CoCo3FPGA].   It is a synthesis of the [[TRS-80 Color Computer#Color Computer 3 .281986.E2.80.931991.29|CoCo 3]] which is designed to run on the [http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=53&No=83 Terasic DE1] FPGA development board.

The CoCo3FPGA contains a 6809 CPU core designed by [http://members.optushome.com.au/jekent/system09/index.html John Kent] which synthesizes the Motorola MC6809.  The core has the ability to run at a clock speed of 25&nbsp;MHz which is considerably faster than the original CoCo 3 which ran at a top speed of 1.79&nbsp;MHz.  All original CoCo 3 graphics modes are supported and additional 256-color modes have been added including a 640x450 x 256-color mode.  Numerous other enhancements make this a viable upgrade path for the CoCo 3 owner who wants higher performance.\n\n;Matchbox CoCo\nRoger Taylor is producing a FPGA CoCo 3 based on the DE0-Nano FPGA board.<ref>http://www.cococommunity.net/how-to-build-your-own-coco-4/</ref>\n\n==Clones and cousins==\nThe [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32 and 64 computers]] are British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an exemplar of the capabilities of the MC6809E (MPU) when coupled with the MC6847 (Video Display Generator - VDG) and the MC6883 (Synchronous Address Multiplexer - SAM). The BIOS code for the Dragon 32 was rewritten based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge. The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the [[television|TV]] output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (not present on any CoCo), an integrated [[6551]]A serial [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]] (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in September 83 and were running at capacity just one month later. Unfortunately sales weren't as good as expected and Tano stopped production and support just one year later.<ref>Dragon Archive History [http://archive.worldofdragon.org/index.php?title=Dragon_History Worldofdragon.org]</ref> A California surplus equipment company, California Digital, bought the remaining stock of Tano built Dragon 64 shortly after and has had new in-the-box Dragon 64s available for purchase as of January 2017.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981205072428/http://www.cadigital.com/computer.htm Tano Dragon], California Digital, Inc., Cadigital.com</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, there existed several CoCo-clones, including the [[Prol\u00f3gica CP-400|Prol\u00f3gica CP-400 Color]] and [[CP400 Color II]], the Varixx VC50, the LZ Color64, the Dynacom MX1600, the Codimex CD6809, and the \"[[vaporware]]\" Microdigital TKS800.\n\nIn Mexico, the [[Micro-SEP]], a CoCo 2 clone with 64 KB of memory, was introduced by the Secretary of Education.

Released in 1983, it was similar in appearance to the [[Timex Sinclair]] models. Like the CoCo, it used the MC6847 VDG and Microsoft Basic, but featured the [[Motorola 6803|MC6803]] instead of the 6809. The MC-10 lacked such features as an 80 column printer and disk storage system, as well as a \"real\" keyboard.

In the 1980s, Radio Shack stores were selling a keyboard that would plug directly into a CoCo 2, though not labeled as such. This keyboard was part of a production run for the never produced Deluxe Color Computer. The Deluxe CoCo was referenced in CoCo manual sets and specifically mentioned as having extra keys, lowercase video, and the ability to accept commands in lowercase. Later versions of the CoCo 2, labeled Tandy instead of TRS-80, had the ability to display true lowercase, but did not accept lowercase commands, although this capability was later available through A-DOS, a third-party replacement ROM for the Disk Controller.\n\nProduction model CoCo 3s have been found with different circuit board layouts and socketed chips. In 2005, a rare CoCo 3 prototype surfaced at the Chicago CoCoFEST, with a built-in floppy disk drive controller and other items still not identified. It also did not use a GIME chip. Instead, all the functionality of the GIME was created using separate chips. There is a hobbyist effort lead primarily by Color Computer enthusiast and electronics engineer Ed Snider (aka Zippster) to reverse engineer these chips so a modern GIME can finally be produced.{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere is also a prototype Ethernet interface for the Color Computer, displaying a board layout date of 1984, and a few other mystery boards that have yet to be examined. There is some evidence that Tandy killed the Ethernet interface at the last minute: an ad mentioning the networking options for some of Tandy's Z80-based computers claimed that the Color Computer would soon have networking capabilities, and the printed manual for an upgraded version of [[OS-9]] Level One listed networking in the table of contents, but had no corresponding text in the body of the manual.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:TRS-80 Color Computer games]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466592476 CoCo: The Colorful History of Tandy\u2019s Underdog Computer]\n*[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/history.html CoCo Chronicles], a history of the Color Computer\n*[http://www.cocopedia.com/ CoCopedia], the TRS-80 CoCo Wiki\n*[http://www.coco3.com/ The Tandy Color Computer Resource Site]\n* [http://www.bighole.nl/pub/mirror/homepage.ntlworld.com/kryten_droid/coco/coco_tm.htm Color computer technical reference] or  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327005335/http://goyim.dyndns.org:8080/coco/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/Color%20Computer%20Technical%20Reference%20Manual%20(1981)(Tandy).pdf Color computer technical reference.pdf]\n*[http://www.haplessgenius.com/mocha Mocha - The JavaScript Color Computer Emulator]\n*{{github|jedie/DragonPy|Dragon/CoCo emulator written in Python}}\n*[http://forums.delphiforums.com/cocosig Color Computer/OS-9 Forum at Delphiforums (formerly Delphi)].

The Tandy Color Computer line started in 1980 with what is now called the CoCo 1 and ended in 1991 with the more powerful CoCo 3. All three CoCo models maintained a high level of software and hardware compatibility, with few programs written for the older model being unable to run on the newer ones.\n\nDespite bearing the TRS-80 name, the Color Computer is a radical departure from the earlier [[TRS-80]]. In particular it has a [[Motorola 6809|Motorola 6809E]] processor, rather than the TRS-80's [[Zilog Z80]]. The machines in the Color Computer line are not compatible with software made for the earlier TRS-80.{{r|byte198103}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TRS-80 Videotex terminal retouched.jpg|thumb|250px|The TRS-80 VideoTex Terminal, circa 1980]]\n\n[[Tandy Corporation]] announced the TRS-80 Color Computer in July 1980 to compete with the inexpensive and popular [[Commodore VIC-20]].<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: It all started 10 years ago in a converted used-car showroom... |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n51 |magazine=80 Micro |pages=50\u201364 |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It began as a joint venture between Tandy and [[Motorola]] Semiconductor, Inc. of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], to develop a low-cost home computer in 1977.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe initial goal of this project, called \"Green Thumb\", was to create a low cost [[Videotex]] terminal for farmers, ranchers, and others in the agricultural industry.<ref name=\"GreenThumb\">{{Cite book|last1=G.

Unfortunately, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola solved this problem by integrating all the functions of the many smaller chips into one chip, the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM). By that time in late 1979, the new and powerful Motorola [[Motorola 6809|MC6809]] processor was released. The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were combined and the AgVision terminal was born.\n\nThe AgVision terminal was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980. Internal differences, if any, are unclear, as not many AgVision terminals survive to this day.<ref name=\"ElencoAgVision\">{{cite news | url=https://vintagecomputer.ca/agvision-videotex-terminal/ | title=AgVision Videotex terminal | work=Vintage Computer | date=2016-12-22 | accessdate=16 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nWith its proven design, the VideoTex terminal contains all the basic components for a general-purpose home computer. The internal [[modem]] was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and [[ROM cartridge|program cartridges]] (\"Program Paks\"), and a RAM button (a sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine) covers the hole where the Modem's LED \"DATA\" indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer. Sharing the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals, at first glance it would be hard to tell the TRS-80 Color Computer from its predecessors.\n\nTandy viewed businesses as its primary market for computers. Although the company's Ed Juge said in 1981 that the Color Computer was \"our entry into the home-computer market\", he described it as \"for serious professionals\", stating that a word processor and spreadsheet would soon be available.<ref name=\"freibergerfuture19810831\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Radio Shack Prepares for the Future | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-08-31 | accessdate=26 October 2016 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=51, 53\u201354}}</ref> In 1987 Tandy CEO John Roach refused to describe it as a home computer.{{r|white198708}} The initial model (catalog number 26-3001) shipped with 4 KB of [[Dynamic Random Access Memory]] (DRAM) and an {{nowrap|8 kB [[Microsoft BASIC]]}} interpreter in [[Read-only memory|ROM]].

For a time, the CoCo was referred to internally as the TRS-90 in reference to the \"9\" in \"6809\".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, this was dropped and all CoCos sold as Radio Shack computers were called TRS-80 in spite of the processor change.\n\nThe CoCo is incompatible with all software for other Tandy compurters.{{r|green198212}} Like its Z80-based predecessors, the CoCo shipped with a version of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]. Tandy licensed [[Microsoft BASIC]]; as with the Z80 systems, there are multiple levels of BASIC. The original CoCo offered standard [[Color BASIC]] and Extended Color BASIC. This was further extended by a Disk Extended Color BASIC ROM included in the floppy controller. The CoCo 3 included Super Extended Color BASIC as standard, deploying extensions added by [[Microware]]. Third-party floppy controller ROMs, such as J&M System JDOS, and DSS Peripherals Disk Controller, enabled the use of double-sided disk drives.\n\nThe CoCo BASIC offered a number of advanced sound, graphics, and program control features many of which would also appear in IBM PC-compatible versions of Microsoft BASIC, these included statements for playing musical notes and drawing graphics primitives. These advanced features were possible on the 8-bit CoCo because 6809 machine language was more code-dense than Z80 or 6502 machine language, thus more features could be packed into a relatively small BASIC ROM.\n\nThe CoCo is designed to be attached to a color television set, whereas the Z80 machines use monochrome [[computer monitor]]s, often built into the case. The CoCo also features an expansion connector for program cartridges (mostly games, although the EDTASM assembler is a cartridge) and other expansion devices, such as floppy-disk controllers and modems. Tandy released a Multi-Pak Interface which allowed switching quickly among four cartridges. This is similar in concept to the Model I's Expansion Interface.\n\nThe CoCo did not have internally-mounted disk drives and instead reverted to the TRS-80 Model I setup with separate external drives in a daisy chain, each unit requiring a separate wall outlet for power. The original drives offered with the CoCo were 35-track TEC units instead of the more expensive 40 track Tandon drives in the Model III\u2014they had a formatted capacity of 160K.\n\nThe floppy controller consisted of a cartridge that plugged into the side cartridge slot which contained the controller circuitry (based on the WD1791) and a ROM with Disk Extended Color BASIC. It was similar to [[Commodore International|Commodore]] disk drives in that the DOS was ROM-based and not a distinct entity from BASIC, however, unlike Commodore DOS, it occupied the main CPU's address space. The disk controller required Extended Color BASIC to work, so it was not compatible with original CoCo 1s that had Color BASIC.\n\nEven with the add-on floppy drive, the CoCo did not have a true DOS until third-party operating systems such as TSC [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX9]] (distributed for the CoCo by Frank Hogg Laboratories) and [[Microware]]'s multi-user, multi-tasking [[OS-9]] were available. However, a disk-based CoCo does contain Disk Extended Color BASIC on an internal ROM in the controller cartridge that gives the BASIC user the ability to save and load programs from the disk and store and retrieve data from disk in various ways.\n\nWhile Z80-based TRS-80s had industry-standard Centronics and RS-232 interfaces, the CoCo instead had a proprietary serial interface with a round DIN connector similar to the Commodore IEC interface for connecting a printer or modem (as there was only one serial port, it was not possible to have both connected at the same time and the user would have to switch between the printer or modem). Most of Radio Shack's printer line sported a connector for the CoCo's serial port in addition to a normal Centronics port.\n\nFor users without disk drives, the CoCo retained the same audio cassette interface as the Model I/III, using a DIN plug with audio in/out and motor control jacks, any standard portable cassette recorder and audio cassettes could be used with it (hi-fi tape decks and metal cassettes were not recommended).\n\nThe CoCo also had two joystick ports, the joysticks are analog devices with potentiometers similar to the Apple II's joysticks rather than the digital-style Atari sticks. The same ports also found their way onto the IBM-compatible Tandy 1000 line.\n\nSome non-program expansion cartridges include a sound/voice synthesizer (which led to the CoCo being used as an accessibility device for the disabled),<ref>{{cite news | title=Speaking Up for the Handicapped | work=Hot CoCo | date=December 1985 | author=Vassilopoulous, Charles A. | pages=51}}</ref> 300-baud modem pack, an RS232 pack (the internal serial port was merely one bit of a parallel port), a hard-drive controller, stereo-music adapter, floppy-disk controller, input tablet, and other accessories. Some of this hardware was designed and marketed by third-party mail-order houses, including a \"Disto Super Controller\" (a floppy controller, with space for an optional serial port or SCSI interface in the same enclosure). The CoCo was the first Tandy computer to have a [[computer mouse|mouse]] available for it; instead of following the IBM PC/Microsoft standard, this mouse was electrically the equivalent of an analogue joystick.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Versions==\nThere were three versions of the Color Computer:\n\n===Color Computer 1 (1980\u20131983) {{anchor|coco1}}===\n[[Image:TRS-80 Color Computer 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|4K TRS-80 Color Computer from 1981, 26-3001]]\n\nThe original version of the Color Computer sported a large silver-gray case with a calculator-like \"[[chiclet keyboard]]\", and was available with memory sizes of 4K (26-3001), 16K (26-3002), or 32K (26-3003). Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard [[Microsoft]] Color [[Microsoft BASIC|Basic]] or (optionally) Extended Color Basic. It used a regular TV for display, and TV out was the only available connection to a display device.\n\nThe early versions of the CoCo 1 had a black keyboard surround, the TRS-80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side, and a RAM badge (\"button\") affixed on the top and right side of the case. Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button, and moved the TRS-80 nameplate to the mid-line of the case.\n\nThe computer was based on a single [[printed-circuit board]], with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consisted of 2104 (4Kx1) chips (4K models) or 4116 (16Kx1) chips (16K models).{{r|byte198103}} The early CoCos only had eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32K requiring piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few jumper wires. A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with \"half-bad\" 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good, in addition, they removed the -5V and -12V power lines used by the older DRAM types. This was transparent to the BASIC programmer since in either configuration 32K of memory was available. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s were shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips; many utilities and programs began to take advantage of the \"hidden\" 32K.\n\nUsers opening the case risked invalidating the warranty.{{r|byte198103}} Radio Shack could upgrade all versions that shipped with standard Color BASIC to Extended Color BASIC, developed by Microsoft, for $99. ''BYTE'' wrote in 1981 that through Extended Color BASIC, Radio Shack \"has released the first ''truly'' easy-to-use and inexpensive system that generates full-color graphics\".<ref name=\"miastkowski198105\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-05/1981_05_BYTE_06-05_Software_Piracy#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Extended Color BASIC for the TRS-80 Color Computer | work=BYTE | date=May 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Miastkowski, Stan | pages=37}}</ref> Eventually the 32K memory option was dropped entirely and only 16K or 64K versions were offered.\n\nIn late 1982, a version of the Color Computer with a white case, called the TDP System 100, was distributed by [[RCA]] and sold through non-Tandy stores. Except for the nameplate and case, it was identical to the Color Computer.<ref name=\"rainbow198209\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/rainbowmagazine-1982-09/The_Rainbow_Magazine_09_1982#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Pipeline | work=The Rainbow | date=September 1982 | accessdate=17 October 2013 | pages=56}}</ref>\n\nAt some point after this, both the Coco and the TDP System 100 shipped with a white case which had ventilation slots that ran the entire length of the case, rather than only on the sides. This ventilation scheme was carried over to the CoCo 2. Some late versions of the CoCo also shipped with a modified keyboard, often referred to as the \"melted\" keyboard, which had bigger keycaps but a similar rubbery feel.\n\nA number of peripherals were available: tape cassette storage, serial printers, a 5.25&nbsp;inch floppy disk drive, a pen and graphics tablet called the \"X-Pad\", speech and sound generators, and joysticks.\n\n{{Gallery\n|width=250\n|lines=2\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1 4x3.jpg|16K TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1 ports.jpg|I/O ports and cartridge slot on the TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1-white case.jpg|Late \"white\" model TRS-80 Color Computer I\n|File:TDP-100 wb.jpg|Tandy Data Products TDP-100 (64K badge was added by user)\n}}\n\n===Color Computer 2 (1983\u20131986) {{anchor|coco2}}===\n[[Image:TRS-80 Color Computer 2-64K.jpg|thumb|250px|Final production 64K Tandy Color Computer 2, showing full-travel keyboard (26-3127B)]]\n\nDuring the initial CoCo 1 production run, much of the discrete support circuitry had been re-engineered into a handful of custom integrated circuits, leaving much of the circuit board area of the CoCo 1 as empty space. To cut production costs, the case was shortened by about 25% and a new, smaller power supply and motherboard were designed. The \"melted\" keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP-100 style ventilation slots were carried over. Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector, the computer was essentially 100% compatible with the previous generation. The deletion of the 12V power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller, which then needed to be upgraded, installed in a Multi-Pak interface, or supplied with external power.\n\nThe CoCo 2 was offered in either 16K or 64K models (there was no 32K CoCo 2).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} 16K models use 16Kx1 DRAMs, but the chips are not the common 4116; they are instead 6665 chips (Radio Shack P/N 8040517), which uses only +5V power rather than the triple voltages used by the 4116. 64K models use standard 4164 chips.\n\n64K models of the CoCo 2 have a control register at $FFDE/$FFDF used to switch between the second 32K of RAM and the OS ROMs. If the ROMs were banked out, the entire 64K of system RAM could be accessed.\n\nProduction was also partially moved to Korea during the CoCo 2's life-span, and many owners of the Korean-built systems referred to them as \"KoKos\". Production in the US and Korea happened in parallel using the same part numbers; very few, if any, differences exist between the USA built and Korean built CoCo 2 machines.\n\nUpgraded BASIC ROMs were also produced, adding a few minor features and correcting some bugs. A redesigned 5-volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM (v1.1). The new controller also added a new command, \"DOS\", which allowed software to be auto-booted from disk (this required a disk that had a specially set up boot sector). It facilitated the use of software on copy protected disks or third-party operating systems, chiefly OS-9.\n\nLater in the production run, the \"melted\" keyboard was replaced with a new, full-travel, typewriter-style keyboard.\n\nThe final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 was made for the models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B (16 KB standard, 16 KB extended, and 64 KB extended respectively). Internally this model was redesigned to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1. This enhanced VDG allowed the use of lower case characters and the ability to change the text screen border color. For compatibility reasons neither of these features were used and were not enabled in BASIC, however the resourceful user could enable them by setting certain memory registers. Midway during the production run of these final CoCo 2s, the nameplate was changed from \"Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2\" to \"Tandy Color Computer 2\". The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.\n\n''[[Creative Computing]]'' wrote in December 1984 that the Color Computer was the best educational computer under $1000.

Instead, [[Microware]] provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes. In order to not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy, Microsoft's unmodified BASIC software was loaded in the CoCo 3's ROM. Upon startup, the ROM is copied to RAM and then patched by Microware's code. The composite basic produced was not without some flaws: the patched code had several bugs, and support for many of the new hardware features was incomplete.\n\nMicroware also provided a version of the [[OS-9]] Level 2 operating system shortly after launch. This OS featured memory-mapping (so each process had its own memory space up to 64K), windowed display, and a more extensive development environment that included a bundled copy of [[BASIC09]]. [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compilers were available. Various members of the CoCo OS-9 community enhanced OS-9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy's request, but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released. Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS-9, a major rewrite of OS-9/6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the added features and speed of the [[Hitachi 6309]] (if the unit has the Hitachi CPU installed).<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nitros9.org\n  |title = NitrOS-9 operating system for the Tandy/Radio Shack Color Computer\n  |accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  |date =\n  |work =\n  |publisher =\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:CoCo3system.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical CoCo 3 system]]\nThe 6809 in the CoCo 1 and 2 ran at 0.895&nbsp;MHz; the CoCo 3 runs at that frequency by default, but is software controllable to run at twice that rate; [[OS-9]] takes advantage of that capability.\n\nA popular accessory was a high-resolution joystick adapter designed by CoCo enthusiast [[Steve Bjork]]. While it did increase the resolution of the joystick/mouse interface by a factor of ten, it did so at the expense of CPU time. A modified version of this interface was included with a software package by Colorware called CoCo-Max 3, by Dave Stamp. This was a [[MacPaint]] work-alike but added support for color graphics. This was a very desirable product for CoCo owners and combined with a MacWrite-like word processor called MAX-10 (also by Dave Stamp and internally named \"MaxWrite\"), provided some of the functionality of an [[Apple Macintosh]], but with color graphics and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhile the CoCo 3 featured many enhancements and was well received, it was not without problems and disappointments. As initially conceived, the CoCo 3 had much hardware acceleration and enhanced sound; these capabilities were scaled back due to aggressive cost-cutting and internal politics crippled the design so it would not be perceived as a threat to the Tandy 1000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This again limited the platform's potential as a game console. Early versions of the GIME had DRAM timing issues which caused random freezes. Due to bugs in the GIME some features that were problematic were marked as \"reserved\" or \"do not use\" in the programming and service manuals.\n\nThe power supply was marginal, and some would overheat if the system memory was expanded to the full {{nowrap|512 KB}} capacity due to the considerable heat generated by the additional RAM on the optional daughterboard. Some CoCo 3 owners opted to add a small fan inside the case to keep it cool.\n\n==Hardware design and integrated circuits==\nInternally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical. The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] chips:\n* MC6809E Microprocessor Unit (MPU)\n* MC6883/SN74LS783/SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor (SAM)\n* [[Motorola 6847|MC6847]] [[Video Display Generator]] (VDG)\n* Two [[Peripheral Interface Adapter]]s (PIA), either MC6821 or MC6822 chips\n\n===SAM===\nThe SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions:\n* Clock generation and synchronization for the 6809E MPU and 6847 VDG\n* Up to 64K Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) control and refresh\n* Device selection based on MPU memory address to determine if the MPU access is to DRAM, ROM, PIA, etc.\n* Duplication of the VDG address counter to \"feed\" the VDG the data it is expecting\n\nThe SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS/TTL chips into one integrated package. Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but, as outlined above, it integrates several other functions as well. It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency (14.31818&nbsp;MHz for NTSC countries). This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing (3.579545&nbsp;MHz for NTSC). The SAM also divides the master clock by 16 (or 8 in certain cases) for the [[two-phase clock|two phase MPU clock]]; in NTSC this is .89&nbsp;MHz (or 1.8&nbsp;MHz if divided by 8).\n\nSwitching the SAM into 1.8&nbsp;MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh. As such, the display shows garbage; this mode was seldom used. However, an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode, where ROM reads (since they do not use the DRAM) occur at 1.8&nbsp;MHz but regular RAM access occurs at .89&nbsp;MHz. In effect, since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM, putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh. Of course, this would throw off the software timing loops and I/O operations would be affected. Despite this, however, the \"high speed [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]\" was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it [[overclocking|overclocked]] the hardware in the CoCo, which was only rated for 1&nbsp;MHz operation.\n\nThe SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, Writing to odd bytes sets it to 1.\n\nDue to limitations in 40 pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG's internal 12-bit address counter. Normally this counter's settings are set to duplicate the VDG's display mode. However, this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is \"fed\" data by the SAM's internal copy of the VDG address counter. This process is called \"Interleaved Direct Memory Access\" (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.\n\nThere are two versions of the SAM. The early one is labeled MC6883 and/or SN74LS783; the later version is labeled SN74LS785. There are some minor timing differences, but the major difference is the support of an 8-bit refresh counter in the 785 version. This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4-bit and certain 64K by 1-bit DRAMs. Some third-party bank-switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8-bit refresh counter to work.\n\n===VDG===\n[[Image:Coco2boot.png|thumb|320px|Power-on screen of a CoCo 2]]\nThe MC6847 is display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high. It can display 9 colors: black, green, yellow, blue, red, buff (almost-but-not-quite white), cyan, magenta, and orange.\n\n====Alphanumeric/Semigraphics display====\n[[Image:Cocobvdg.png|thumb|320px|Sample character set display of 6847 VDG]]\nThe CoCo is physically wired such that its default alphanumeric display is actually \"Semigraphics 4\" mode.\n\nIn alphanumeric mode, each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high. This display mode occupies 512 bytes of memory from $400-$5FF and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines. The internal ROM character generator only holds 64 characters, so no lower case characters are provided. Lower case characters were rendered as upper case characters with inverted color. Although simulated screen shots would show this as green on black, on most CoCo generations it was actually green on very dark green.\n\nSemigraphics is a hybrid display mode where alphanumerics and chunky block graphics can be mixed together on the same screen. If the 8th bit of the character is set, it is a semigraphics character. If cleared, it is an alphanumeric. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits determine which \"quadrant\" of the character box is either the selected color or black. This is the only mode where it is possible (without sneaky tricks) to display all 9 colors on the screen simultaneously. If used to only display semigraphics, the screen becomes a 64\u00d732 nine color graphics mode. The CoCo features several BASIC commands to manage this screen as a low-res graphics display.\n\nThe alphanumeric display has two colorsets. The one used by default on the CoCo has black characters on a green background. The alternate has black characters on an orange background. The colorset selection does not affect semigraphics characters. The border in this mode is always black.\n\nThe 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1/6 of the character box is lit. In this mode only 4 colors are possible but the Colorset bit of the VDG can select two different groups of the 4 colors. Due to a peculiarity of its hardware, only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.<ref>[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/semigraphics.html Semi-graphics-6 display mode], By Bill Yakowenko, 25-Mar-1996, Color Computer stuff - Classic Computers, Cs.unc.edu</ref>\n\n====Additional Semigraphics modes====\nBy setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces. This creates the \"virtual\" modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24.<ref>[http://www.lomont.org/Software/Misc/CoCo/Lomont_CoCoHardware.pdf Chris Lomont's Color Computer 1/2/3 Hardware Programming]</ref> In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.\n\nA programmer's reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy's research lab, the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled, and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented. CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes, and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation.<ref><!--[http://home.att.net/~robert.gault/Coco/History/Semi24.htm Semigraphics24 for the Coco1&2. Machine language program to create 8 true colors plus text on screen at one time.]-->[http://aaronwolfe.com/robert.gault/Coco/History/History_files/Semi24.html The Forgotten Graphics Mode Semigraphics-24], By Robert Gault, Date: Feb 10, 2010, What's In a Name? Coco ? It Sure Ain't Hot Chocolate</ref>\n\n====Graphics display====\nThere were several bitmap display modes, which were divided into two categories: \"resolution\" graphics and \"color\" graphics. In resolution modes, each pixel is addressable as either on or off. There are two colorsets available, the first was black dots on a green background and green border, the second, more commonly used one has white dots on a black background with a white border. In color modes, each pixel was two bits, selecting one of four colors. Again the colorset input to the VDG determined which colors were used. The first colorset has a green border, and the colors green, yellow, red, and blue were available. The second colorset has a white border and the colors white, cyan, magenta and orange were available. Resolution graphics have 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, 128\u00d7192, and 256\u00d7192 densities. Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64\u00d764, 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, and 128\u00d7192 densities. The maximum size of a bitmap screen is 6144 bytes beginning at $600 (cassette systems) or $E00 (disk systems).\n\n====Artifact colors====\nThe 256\u00d7192 two color graphics mode uses four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system (see [[composite artifact colors]]). \nIt is not possible to reliably display 256 dots across the screen due to the limitations of the NTSC signal and the phase relationship between the VDG clock and colorburst frequency.\n\nIn the first colorset, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black are not distinct and appear as a muddy green color. However, when one switches to the white and black colorset, instead of a muddy gray as expected, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots will give the opposite color. In effect this mode becomes a 128\u00d7192 4 color graphics mode where black, orange, blue, and white are available (the [[Apple II]] created color graphics by exploiting a similar effect).\n\nMost CoCo games used this mode as the colors available are more useful than the ones provided in the hardware 4 color modes. Unfortunately the VDG internally can power up on either the rising or falling edge of the clock, so the bit patterns that represent orange and blue are not predictable. Most CoCo games would start up with a title screen and invited the user to press the reset button until the colors were correct. The CoCo 3 fixed the clock-edge problem so it was always the same; a user would hold the F1 key during reset to choose the other color set.\n\nOn a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact; to see them one would have to use a TV or composite monitor, or patch the games to use the hardware 128\u00d7192 four color mode in which the GIME chip allows the color choices to be mapped. Users in [[PAL]] countries saw green and purple stripes instead of solid red and blue colors.\n\nReaders of ''[[The Rainbow (magazine)|The Rainbow]]'' or ''Hot CoCo'' magazine learned that they could use some POKE commands to switch the 6847 VDG into one of the artifact modes, while Extended Color Basic continued to operate as though it were still displaying one of the 128\u00d7192 four-color modes. Thus, the entire set of Extended Color Basic graphics commands could be used with the artifact colors. Some users went on to develop a set of 16 artifact colors{{how|date=October 2012}} using a 4\u00d72 pixel matrix, giving this set of colors: black, dark cyan, brick red, light violet, dark blue, azure (the blue above), olive green, brown, purple, light blue, orange, yellow, light gray, blue-white, pink-white, and white. Use of POKE commands also made these colors available to the graphics commands, although the colors had to be drawn one horizontal line at a time. Some interesting artworks were produced from these effects, especially since the CoCo Max art package provided them in its palette of colors.\n\n====Lower case and the 6847T1====\n[[Image:Coco2bvdg lc.png|thumb|320px|Sample character set display of 6847T1 VDG in true lowercase mode]]\nThe 6847 is capable of using an external character generator. Several third-party add-on adapter boards would allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters.\n\nVery late in the CoCo 2 production run, an enhanced VDG was available. Called the 6847T1, it included a lower case character generator and the ability to display a green/orange or black border on the text screen. Its other changes were mainly to reduce parts count by incorporating an internal data latch. The lower case capability of this VDG is not enabled by default on this system and is not even mentioned in the manual. Only through some tinkering and research was this feature discovered by intrepid CoCo users.\n\nThe 6847T1 may also carry the part number XC80652P; these may have been pre-release parts.\n\n===PIAs===\nThere are two PIA chips in all CoCo models. The PIAs are dedicated mainly to I/O operations such as driving the internal 6-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC), reading the status of the DAC's voltage comparator, controlling the relay for the cassette motor, reading the keyboard matrix, controlling the VDG mode control pins, reading and writing to the RS232 serial I/O port, and controlling the internal analog multiplexers.\n\nThe earliest CoCo models had two standard 6821 chips. Later, due to changes in the keyboard design, it was found that the 6822 IIA (industrial interface adapter) was better suited to the keyboard's [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola but was produced for Tandy as an ASIC with a special Tandy part number, SC67331P. Functionally the 6821 and 6822 are identical and one can put a 6821 in place of the 6822 if that part is bad. Some external pull-up resistors may be needed to use a 6821 to replace a 6822 in a CoCo for normal keyboard operation.\n\n===Interface to external peripherals===\nDue to the CoCo's design, the MPU encounters no wait states in normal operation. This means that precise software controlled timing loops are easily implemented. This is important since the CoCo has no specialized hardware for any I/O. All I/O operations, such as cassette reading and writing, serial I/O, scanning the keyboard, and reading the position of the joysticks, must be done entirely in software. This reduces hardware cost but reduces system performance as the MPU is unavailable during these operations.\n\nAs an example, the CoCo cassette interface is perhaps one of the fastest available (1500-bit/s) but it does so entirely under software control. While reading or writing a cassette the CoCo has no CPU time free for other tasks. They must wait until an error occurs or all the data needed is read.\n\n===CoCo 3 hardware changes===\nThe hardware in the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models was functionally the same; the only differences were in packaging and integration of some functions into small ASICs. In the CoCo 3, a new VLSI ASIC called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME), integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both. The CoCo 3 supports 40 and 80 column text displays and the ability to run at 1.8&nbsp;MHz without loss of video. The processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21, which are 2&nbsp;MHz parts.\n\n==Discontinuation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nOn October 26, 1990, Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line.\n\n[[Wayne Green]] wrote in ''[[80 Micro]]'' in December 1982 that Tandy had \"virtually abandoned\" the Color Computer. As with its other computers Tandy attempted to monopolize hardware and software sales, but, he wrote, the Color Computer was incompatible with other Tandy software and what was available was of poor quality. \"I'm sure there are at least fifty software firms out there that would love to work with the Shack\", Green said, but \"it seems that the Shack people are at war with their supporters and potential suppliers\".<ref name=\"green198212\">{{Cite magazine |last=Green |first=Wayne |date=December 1982 |title=Is the Shack in real trouble? |url=https://archive.org/details/80_Micro_1982-12_1001001_US/page/n7/mode/2up |magazine=80 Micro |type=editorial |pages=8,10,12 |access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nMost current and former CoCo owners agree<ref name=\"Tandy Coco Sales\">{{cite book|last1=G.

Very few stores displayed a 512K machine or a CoCo 3 running such games as ''[[King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human|King's Quest III]]'' or ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards|Leisure Suit Larry]]''. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Successors===\nIn spite of Tandy's apparent lack of concern for the CoCo market, there were rumors of the existence of a prototype {{nowrap|CoCo 4}} at Tandy's Fort Worth headquarters. Several first-hand accounts of the prototype came from people like Mark Siegel of Tandy and Ken Kaplan of Microware. In 2013, evidence surfaced that Tandy at least had considered the idea of a CoCo 4, when a prototype case appeared in the book \"CoCo: The Colorful History of Tandy's Underdog Computer.\" That case is now in the hands of a collector.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA few independent companies attempted to carry the CoCo torch, but the lack of decent backwards compatibility with the {{nowrap|CoCo 3}} failed to entice much of the CoCo community over to these new independent platforms. Many of these independent platforms did run OS9/68k, which was very similar to [[OS-9]]. However, the bulk of the CoCo community moved on to more mainstream platforms. Some CoCo users swore their loyalty to Motorola and moved on to the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and the [[Macintosh]], all of which were based on the [[Motorola 68000]] processor. Others jumped to the IBM PC-compatible.\n\n;Tomcat\nFrank Hogg Labs introduced the Tomcat TC-9 in June 1990, which was somewhat compatible with the {{nowrap|CoCo 3,}} but was mostly only able to run [[OS-9]] software. A later version called the TC-70 (running on a Signetics 68070) had strong compatibility with the MM/1, and also ran OS-9/68K.\n\n;MM/1\nThe ''Multi-Media One'' was introduced in July 1990, ran [[OS-9]]/68K on a 15&nbsp;MHz Signetics 68070 processor with {{nowrap|3 MB RAM,}} and had a 640\u00d7208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640\u00d7416 interlaced mode. It included a [[SCSI]] interface, stereo A/D and D/A conversion, an optional [[MIDI]] interface, and (later) an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a [[MC68340|Motorola 68340]] running at up to 25&nbsp;MHz. It is estimated that about 500 units were sold.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n;AT306\nThe AT306 (also known as the MM/1B) was a successor to the MM/1 that contained a Motorola 68306 CPU, OS-9/68K 3.0, and was designed to allow the use of [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus cards. It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider, and sold by Carl's company, Kreider Electronics.  It was also sold as the \"WCP-306\" by Bill Wittman of Wittman Computer Products.\n\n;Delmar System IV/Peripheral Technology PT68K-4\nPeripheral Technology produced a 16&nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 system called a PTK68K-4, which was sold as a kit or a complete motherboard. Delmar sold complete systems based on the PT68K-4 and called the ''Delmar System IV''. The PT68K-4 has the footprint of an IBM PC, so it will fit in a normal PC case, and it has seven 8-bit ISA slots. Video was provided by a standard IBM style monochrome, [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] video card and monitor, but for high-resolution graphics the software only supported certain [[Tseng Labs ET4000|ET4000]] video cards. It appears that most users of this system use/used [[OS-9]], but there are several operating systems for it, including REX (a FLEX-like OS), and SK*DOS. Dan Farnsworth, who wrote REX, also wrote a BASIC interpreter that was fairly compatible to DECB, but it was too little, too late to be of interest to many CoCo users. There was also a card available called an ALT86, which was basically an [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]] compatible computer on a card, which allowed the user to run DOS programs on it. In fact, both the 68000 and the ALT86 card could be run at the same time, if access to the ISA bus was not needed from the 68000 side of it.\n\n;CoCo3FPGA\nGary Becker produced a broadly compatible version of the CoCo3 with enhancements called the [http://www.retr09.com/wiki/CoCo3FPGA CoCo3FPGA].   It is a synthesis of the [[TRS-80 Color Computer#Color Computer 3 .281986.E2.80.931991.29|CoCo 3]] which is designed to run on the [http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=53&No=83 Terasic DE1] FPGA development board.

The CoCo3FPGA contains a 6809 CPU core designed by [http://members.optushome.com.au/jekent/system09/index.html John Kent] which synthesizes the Motorola MC6809.  The core has the ability to run at a clock speed of 25&nbsp;MHz which is considerably faster than the original CoCo 3 which ran at a top speed of 1.79&nbsp;MHz.  All original CoCo 3 graphics modes are supported and additional 256-color modes have been added including a 640x450 x 256-color mode.  Numerous other enhancements make this a viable upgrade path for the CoCo 3 owner who wants higher performance.\n\n;Matchbox CoCo\nRoger Taylor is producing a FPGA CoCo 3 based on the DE0-Nano FPGA board.<ref>http://www.cococommunity.net/how-to-build-your-own-coco-4/</ref>\n\n==Clones and cousins==\nThe [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32 and 64 computers]] are British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an exemplar of the capabilities of the MC6809E (MPU) when coupled with the MC6847 (Video Display Generator - VDG) and the MC6883 (Synchronous Address Multiplexer - SAM). The BIOS code for the Dragon 32 was rewritten based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge. The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the [[television|TV]] output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (not present on any CoCo), an integrated [[6551]]A serial [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]] (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in September 83 and were running at capacity just one month later. Unfortunately sales weren't as good as expected and Tano stopped production and support just one year later.<ref>Dragon Archive History [http://archive.worldofdragon.org/index.php?title=Dragon_History Worldofdragon.org]</ref> A California surplus equipment company, California Digital, bought the remaining stock of Tano built Dragon 64 shortly after and has had new in-the-box Dragon 64s available for purchase as of January 2017.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981205072428/http://www.cadigital.com/computer.htm Tano Dragon], California Digital, Inc., Cadigital.com</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, there existed several CoCo-clones, including the [[Prol\u00f3gica CP-400|Prol\u00f3gica CP-400 Color]] and [[CP400 Color II]], the Varixx VC50, the LZ Color64, the Dynacom MX1600, the Codimex CD6809, and the \"[[vaporware]]\" Microdigital TKS800.\n\nIn Mexico, the [[Micro-SEP]], a CoCo 2 clone with 64 KB of memory, was introduced by the Secretary of Education. The Micro-SEP was intended to be distributed nationally to all the public schools teaching the 7th to 9th grades. They were presented as a design of the Center of Advanced Research and Studies ([[CINVESTAV]]) of the National Polytechnic Institute ([[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional|IPN]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.redescolar.org.mx/ezequiel/?page_id=10 |title=Red Escolar y el modelo de uso de las Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y la Comunicaci\u00f3n en Educaci\u00f3n |accessdate=2008-06-11 |date=October 16, 2006 |work=4\u00ba Encuentro Nacional de Red Escolar |publisher= |language=Spanish |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226014402/http://blogs.redescolar.org.mx/ezequiel/?page_id=10 |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}</ref> Like the Dragon, these computers also included video output. Whether these computers were \"designed\" by this institute, or were licensed from the original design, is unclear.\n\nA Taiwan-based company, Sampo, also made a CoCo clone, the Sampo Color Computer.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-11/1982_11_BYTE_07-11_Graphics#page/n215/mode/2up/search/sampo Computers in Taiwan, R.O.C: Color computer and BTC-14000 terminal from SAMPO CO], Page 192-22, November 1982 BYTE Magazine</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-11/1982_11_BYTE_07-11_Graphics#page/n199/mode/2up/search/sampo Advertisement: Introducing a duet of SAMPO computer products!], Page 192-7, November 1982 BYTE Magazine</ref> The Sampo was supposedly available in Taiwan, Korea, and possibly other Asian countries. It is believed that Tandy blocked sales in the US with legal action due to copyright infringements on the ROM code.\n\nA cousin of the CoCo, the [[TRS-80 MC-10|MC-10]], or Micro Color Computer, was sold in Radio Shack stores as an entry-level computer at a lower cost than the CoCo. Released in 1983, it was similar in appearance to the [[Timex Sinclair]] models. Like the CoCo, it used the MC6847 VDG and Microsoft Basic, but featured the [[Motorola 6803|MC6803]] instead of the 6809. The MC-10 lacked such features as an 80 column printer and disk storage system, as well as a \"real\" keyboard. Accordingly, it did not sell well and was withdrawn after just two years of production.<ref>1984 Tandy Catalog RSC 11 was the last to have the MC-10 [http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/extra_stuff.html Radioshackcatalogs.com]</ref> An MC-10 clone, the Sysdata Tcolor, was available in Brazil with 16 KB ROM.\n\n==Prototypes and rare versions==\n[[Image:CoCo3Prototype.jpg|thumb|300px|A Color Computer 3 prototype]]\nVarious prototypes for the CoCo have surfaced over the years. In the 1980s, Radio Shack stores were selling a keyboard that would plug directly into a CoCo 2, though not labeled as such. This keyboard was part of a production run for the never produced Deluxe Color Computer. The Deluxe CoCo was referenced in CoCo manual sets and specifically mentioned as having extra keys, lowercase video, and the ability to accept commands in lowercase. Later versions of the CoCo 2, labeled Tandy instead of TRS-80, had the ability to display true lowercase, but did not accept lowercase commands, although this capability was later available through A-DOS, a third-party replacement ROM for the Disk Controller.\n\nProduction model CoCo 3s have been found with different circuit board layouts and socketed chips. In 2005, a rare CoCo 3 prototype surfaced at the Chicago CoCoFEST, with a built-in floppy disk drive controller and other items still not identified. It also did not use a GIME chip. Instead, all the functionality of the GIME was created using separate chips. There is a hobbyist effort lead primarily by Color Computer enthusiast and electronics engineer Ed Snider (aka Zippster) to reverse engineer these chips so a modern GIME can finally be produced.{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere is also a prototype Ethernet interface for the Color Computer, displaying a board layout date of 1984, and a few other mystery boards that have yet to be examined. There is some evidence that Tandy killed the Ethernet interface at the last minute: an ad mentioning the networking options for some of Tandy's Z80-based computers claimed that the Color Computer would soon have networking capabilities, and the printed manual for an upgraded version of [[OS-9]] Level One listed networking in the table of contents, but had no corresponding text in the body of the manual.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:TRS-80 Color Computer games]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466592476 CoCo: The Colorful History of Tandy\u2019s Underdog Computer]\n*[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/history.html CoCo Chronicles], a history of the Color Computer\n*[http://www.cocopedia.com/ CoCopedia], the TRS-80 CoCo Wiki\n*[http://www.coco3.com/ The Tandy Color Computer Resource Site]\n* [http://www.bighole.nl/pub/mirror/homepage.ntlworld.com/kryten_droid/coco/coco_tm.htm Color computer technical reference] or  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327005335/http://goyim.dyndns.org:8080/coco/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/Color%20Computer%20Technical%20Reference%20Manual%20(1981)(Tandy).pdf Color computer technical reference.pdf]\n*[http://www.haplessgenius.com/mocha Mocha - The JavaScript Color Computer Emulator]\n*{{github|jedie/DragonPy|Dragon/CoCo emulator written in Python}}\n*[http://forums.delphiforums.com/cocosig Color Computer/OS-9 Forum at Delphiforums (formerly Delphi)].
