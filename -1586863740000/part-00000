It was founded in 1946, and  in 1957 introduced the world's first entirely electric compact calculator. It was an early digital camera innovator, and during the 1980s and 1990s, the company developed numerous affordable home electronic keyboards for musicians along with introducing the world's first mass-produced digital watches.\n\n==History==\nCasio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio ([[:ja:\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u96c4|\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u96c4]] 1917\u20131993), an [[engineer]] specializing in fabrication technology.<ref name=\"History\"/> Kashio's first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a finger ring that would hold a [[cigarette]], allowing the wearer to [[smoking in Japan|smoke]] the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer's hands-free.<ref name=\"Casio-Europe\">{{cite web|title=CASIO Corporate History 1954 |accessdate=13 February 2016|url=http://www.casio-europe.com/euro/corporate/corporatehistory/detail/1954/|website=CASIO-Europe|publisher=CASIO Europe GmbH|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219065117/http://www.casio-europe.com/euro/corporate/corporatehistory/detail/1954/|archivedate=19 February 2016}}</ref> Japan was [[occupation of Japan|impoverished]] immediately following [[World War II]], so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success.\n\nAfter seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in [[Ginza]], Tokyo in 1949, Kashio and his younger brothers (Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio) used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to develop their calculators. Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be operated by hand using a crank or using a motor (see [[adding machine]]). \n\nToshio possessed some knowledge of electronics and set out to make a calculator using [[solenoid]]s. The desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was Japan's first electro-mechanical calculator. One of the central and more important innovations of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad; at that time other calculators were using a \"full keypad\", which meant that each place in the number (1s, 10s, 100s, etc ...) had nine keys. Another distinguishing innovation was the use of a single display window instead of the three display windows (one for each argument and one for the answer) used in other calculators.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://astrumpeople.com/tadao-kashio-biography/|title=Tadao Kashio Biography: History of Casio Computer Company|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nCasio Computer Co., Ltd. was formed in June 1957.<ref name=\"History\"/> That year, Casio released the Model 14-A, sold for 485,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]],<ref>[http://www.dentaku-museum.com/calc/calculator/casiod/casiod.html Casio desktop calculator] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112230255/http://www.dentaku-museum.com/calc/calculator/casiod/casiod.html |date=12 January 2008 }} by Dentaku Museum.</ref> the world's first all-electric compact calculator, which was based on relay technology.\n\nIn the 1980s, Casio's budget electronic instruments and its line of affordable home electronic [[Keyboard instrument|musical keyboard instruments]] became popular. The company also became well known for the wide variety and innovation of its [[wristwatch]]es. It was one of the earliest manufacturers of [[quartz watch]]es, both digital and analog. It also began selling calculator watches during this time. Casio also introduced one of the first watches that could display the time in many different time zones of the world and with features like recording temperature, atmospheric-pressure and altitude. In the later years, Casio's wristwatches were fitted with receivers to synchronise with radio towers around the world and [[Global Positioning System]] for timekeeping accuracy.\n\nA number of notable digital camera innovations have also been made by Casio, including the QV-10, the first consumer digital camera with an LCD screen on the back<ref name=\"Casio\"/> (developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995), the first consumer three-megapixel camera, the first true ultra-compact model, and the first digital camera to incorporate ceramic lens technology, using [[Lumicera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7434120861/casioceramiclens|title=Casio's ceramic lens|website=DPReview}}</ref>\n\n=== Price fixing ===\n\nIn July 2019, the company's UK arm, '''Casio Electronics Co.

commercial electronics manufacturing [[corporation|company]] headquartered in [[Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Its products include [[calculator]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[digital camera]]s, electronic [[musical instrument]]s, and analogue and [[digital watch]]es. It was founded in 1946, and  in 1957 introduced the world's first entirely electric compact calculator. It was an early digital camera innovator, and during the 1980s and 1990s, the company developed numerous affordable home electronic keyboards for musicians along with introducing the world's first mass-produced digital watches.\n\n==History==\nCasio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio ([[:ja:\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u96c4|\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u96c4]] 1917\u20131993), an [[engineer]] specializing in fabrication technology.<ref name=\"History\"/> Kashio's first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a finger ring that would hold a [[cigarette]], allowing the wearer to [[smoking in Japan|smoke]] the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer's hands-free.<ref name=\"Casio-Europe\">{{cite web|title=CASIO Corporate History 1954 |accessdate=13 February 2016|url=http://www.casio-europe.com/euro/corporate/corporatehistory/detail/1954/|website=CASIO-Europe|publisher=CASIO Europe GmbH|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219065117/http://www.casio-europe.com/euro/corporate/corporatehistory/detail/1954/|archivedate=19 February 2016}}</ref> Japan was [[occupation of Japan|impoverished]] immediately following [[World War II]], so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success.\n\nAfter seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in [[Ginza]], Tokyo in 1949, Kashio and his younger brothers (Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio) used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to develop their calculators. Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be operated by hand using a crank or using a motor (see [[adding machine]]). \n\nToshio possessed some knowledge of electronics and set out to make a calculator using [[solenoid]]s. The desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was Japan's first electro-mechanical calculator. One of the central and more important innovations of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad; at that time other calculators were using a \"full keypad\", which meant that each place in the number (1s, 10s, 100s, etc ...) had nine keys. Another distinguishing innovation was the use of a single display window instead of the three display windows (one for each argument and one for the answer) used in other calculators.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://astrumpeople.com/tadao-kashio-biography/|title=Tadao Kashio Biography: History of Casio Computer Company|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nCasio Computer Co., Ltd. was formed in June 1957.<ref name=\"History\"/> That year, Casio released the Model 14-A, sold for 485,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]],<ref>[http://www.dentaku-museum.com/calc/calculator/casiod/casiod.html Casio desktop calculator] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112230255/http://www.dentaku-museum.com/calc/calculator/casiod/casiod.html |date=12 January 2008 }} by Dentaku Museum.</ref> the world's first all-electric compact calculator, which was based on relay technology.\n\nIn the 1980s, Casio's budget electronic instruments and its line of affordable home electronic [[Keyboard instrument|musical keyboard instruments]] became popular. The company also became well known for the wide variety and innovation of its [[wristwatch]]es. It was one of the earliest manufacturers of [[quartz watch]]es, both digital and analog. It also began selling calculator watches during this time. Casio also introduced one of the first watches that could display the time in many different time zones of the world and with features like recording temperature, atmospheric-pressure and altitude. In the later years, Casio's wristwatches were fitted with receivers to synchronise with radio towers around the world and [[Global Positioning System]] for timekeeping accuracy.\n\nA number of notable digital camera innovations have also been made by Casio, including the QV-10, the first consumer digital camera with an LCD screen on the back<ref name=\"Casio\"/> (developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995), the first consumer three-megapixel camera, the first true ultra-compact model, and the first digital camera to incorporate ceramic lens technology, using [[Lumicera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7434120861/casioceramiclens|title=Casio's ceramic lens|website=DPReview}}</ref>\n\n=== Price fixing ===\n\nIn July 2019, the company's UK arm, '''Casio Electronics Co.

In 2011, he starred as [[Jackson Brodie]] in a BBC adaptation of [[Kate Atkinson]]'s ''[[Case Histories (TV series)|Case Histories]]''. For his portrayal of the detective, Isaacs won a Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television.\n\nIsaacs starred as Detective Michael Britten in the NBC series ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', which premiered on 1 March 2012, and ended in May 2012. After Britten gets into a terrible car wreck with his family, his dreams begin to take on two alternate realities, one in which his wife died in the crash and one in which his son died. Says Isaacs about the ambitious premise: \"There's no question it's challenging. We've got a bunch of very experienced writers who have written things from HBO shows to ''[[The X-Files]]'', to ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' and everything in between. And they are challenged. All of them have said that it's the hardest job that they've ever had. But sometimes that's a good thing. \u2026 If it comes easily, that they could write in their sleep, I personally wouldn't want to act \u2013 and I think the audience wouldn't want to watch.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/02/24/jason-isaacs-new-nbc-series-awake |title=Jason Isaacs on his new NBC series, 'Awake' |first=Karl |last=Paloucek |date=24 February 2012 |work=Channel Guide |accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Isaacs took the lead role in the [[USA Network]] action adventure drama series ''[[Dig (TV series)|Dig]]''.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]]. It is a superset of [[ASCII]], and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252 but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]].\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015,<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |author1=George W.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |author1=George W.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite
