Ever since MetsubouJinrai.net's cyber-terrorism became known, Hiden Intelligence began to use anti-viruses when they manufacture new HumaGears. After defeating MetsubouJinrai.net, Hiden Intelligence faced their corporate rival, ZAIA Enterprise, in a Workplace Competition; only to get bought out in the end.\n*{{nihongo|Hiden Manufacturing Co., Ltd.|\u98db\u96fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u6240|Hiden Seisakujo}}: After Hiden Intelligence was bought out by ZAIA Enterprise, Hiden Manufacturing was created to maintain the Hiden legacy, continue creating HumaGears, and fight back against ZAIA Enterprise. Their base of operations was established in an abandoned office within Daybreak Town.\n\n===Aruto Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Aruto Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u6216\u4eba|Hiden Aruto}}, born on May 1, 1997, is a 22-year-old kind-hearted failed comedian who is suddenly appointed the CEO of Hiden Intelligence following the death of his grandfather, Korenosuke. As a child, he was taken care of by a HumaGear modeled after his absentee father, Soreo. After the HumaGear sacrificed himself to protect him during the {{nihongo|Daybreak|\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Deibureiku}} Incident, Aruto firmly developed the ideal that HumaGears are the future for humanity, and that they cannot turn evil on their own accord. Thus, despite his initial disinterest in running Hiden Intelligence, he reconsiders; resolving to protect both humanity and HumaGears from the MetsubouJinrai.net cyber-terrorist group as {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Zero-One|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 Zero Wan}}. At first, Aruto wanted to maintain a secret identity as Zero-One. Due to A.I.M.S. considering him an enemy however, he reveals himself to Isamu as a sign of trust and forms an uneasy alliance with him in order to learn more of MetsubouJinrai.net. Despite his goofy behavior, Aruto knows when to be serious and is smarter than he appears, such as when he revealed the cyber-terrorist group's existence during a press conference to prove Hiden Intelligence's innocence. He is also aware of his own inexperience in running a company, being willing to listen to vice-president Fukuzoe's advice despite knowing the latter wants him out.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Aruto finds himself in an alternate timeline version of Daybreak Town before being attacked by Another Zero-One, a monster created by the Time Jacker Finis, who came from the World of Zi-O to alter his history; resulting in him losing his powers. Just as Another Zero-One is about to kill Aruto, he is saved by [[List of Kamen Rider Zi-O characters|Sougo Tokiwa and his friends]]. Due to the Another Rider's existence negating his powers, a mysterious individual (later revealed to be his father, Soreo) gives Aruto a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser so he can regain his true powers. At first, Aruto pitied Sougo due to his cursed fate as Ohma Zi-O. After Sougo's friends tell him of his immunity to timeline changes, he finds out that he was created by Sougo's dream and understood why Sougo was helping him recover his timeline. After his timeline is restored, Aruto asked Black Woz to visit Sougo's past self and warn him of [[Kamen Rider Zi-O the Movie: Over Quartzer|his impending doom]]; implying that he was the one who stopped Sougo from becoming Ohma Zi-O.\n \nDuring his first few battles, Aruto becomes troubled by how some of the Magias were formerly HumaGears that had achieved technological singularity, especially those he had formed a bond with. His belief that HumaGears can't turn evil is later shattered by the revelation that MetsubouJinrai.net was formed and led by rogue HumaGears Horobi and Jin. Despite this, Aruto was able to harden his resolve and continue fighting to protect people and HumaGears. After weakening MetsubouJinrai.net, Aruto finds himself targeted by ZAIA Enterprise's corrupt president Gai Amatsu, who seeks to destroy his reputation and take over Hiden Intelligence due to a grudge against his grandfather. In their Workplace Competition, when Gai forced a HumaGear to turn into a Magia just so he could destroy them, Aruto snapped; unknowingly allowing the Ark to use his anger to enhance his abilities. Gai later manipulates Aruto's rage to turn him into a berserker using the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key to trap him within the Ark's control. \n\nThanks to the HumaGears Aruto had bonded with however, he was cleansed of his anger and gained control over his new form so he could give Gai his first true defeat. Even in spite of this, the ZAIA CEO won the Workplace Competition and took control of Hiden Intelligence. After losing his company, Aruto joins forces with Is and Jin to regain his Rider powers and rebel against Gai; forming Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nAruto becomes Zero-One by using the {{nihongo|Hiden Zero-One Driver|\u98db\u96fb\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Hiden Zero Wan Doraib\u0101}}, the company's Rider system which only responds to the current CEO of Hiden Intelligence or anyone of the Hiden lineage, with the [[SD card]]-like {{nihongo|Progrise Keys|\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30ad\u30fc|Puroguraizu K\u012b}}, which contain animal data known as {{nihongo|Rider Models|\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb|Raida Moderu}} that grant him access to a set of different armored forms each with their own unique abilities. As Zero-One, he wields a multi-form {{nihongo|Attache Weapon|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a6\u30a7\u30dd\u30f3|Atasshu Wepon}} called the {{nihongo|Attache Calibur|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ab\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc|Atasshu Karib\u0101}}, which can switch from its briefcase-like {{nihongo|Attache Mode|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Atasshu M\u014ddo}} to the sword-like {{nihongo|Blade Mode|\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Bur\u0113do M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Strash|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Sutorashhu|Bag Strike Slash}} or {{nihongo|Kaban Dynamic|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af|Kaban Dainamikku|Bag Dynamic}}. While the Attache Calibur is his primary weapon, he can also use other Attache Weapons if necessary. By scanning the smartphone-like {{nihongo|Hiden Risephone|\u98db\u96fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3|Hiden Raizufon}} on the Hiden Zero-One Driver, Zero-One can summon his personal motorcycle, the {{nihongo|Rise Hopper|\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Raizu Hopp\u0101}}, from Hiden Intelligence's {{nihongo|Zea|\u30bc\u30a2}} satellite. Additionally, the Hiden Zero-One Driver grants Aruto the ability to directly interface with the Zea satellite's mainframe in unique ways. As Is explains, his brain seems to be able to process information at the same speed as most A.I. systems, as evidenced by him rapidly learning how to use the Driver just before his first battle.\n\n*{{nihongo|Rising [[Grasshopper|Hopper]]|\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Raijingu Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's fluorescent yellow-colored default form, which grants enhanced jumping and kicking capabilities via the leg-mounted {{nihongo|Rising Jumper|\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc|Raijingu Janp\u0101}}.

The corresponding Progrise Key was stolen by Jin, who used it to further MetsubouJinrai.net's goals as Kamen Rider Jin until his first demise; allowing Aruto to recover it. First used in ''Kamen Rider Zi-O the Movie: Over Quartzer''.\n**{{nihongo|Flaming [[Tiger]]|\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc|Fureimingu Taig\u0101}}: Zero-One's red-colored armor, which arms him with the {{nihongo|Panthera Burner|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc|Pantera B\u0101n\u0101}} gauntlets that grant pyrokinesis.

Unlike Aruto's other auxiliary Progrise Keys, which were created by Is using Hiden Intelligence's 3D printer, Yua grants him the use of this Progrise Key after Gai gave it to her.\n*{{nihongo|Breaking [[Mammoth]]|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30f3\u30e2\u30b9|Bureikingu Manmosu}}: Zero-One's giant silver-colored mecha that is formed from a giant version of the corresponding Progrise Key combining with Hiden Intelligence's Zea satellite, which is capable of switching between a humanoid robot form and a flying {{nihongo|Jet Form|\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0|Jetto F\u014dmu}}. When using this Progrise Key, Zero-One will automatically transform into his Rising Hopper form. His finisher in this mecha is the {{nihongo|Breaking Impact|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8|Bureikingu Inpakuto}}. Thanks to Yua, the corresponding Progrise Key was reverse-engineered from the Mammoth Zetsumerise Key, which she managed to confiscate from MetsubouJinrai.net before they could retrieve it.\n*{{nihongo|Shining Hopper|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Shainingu Hopp\u0101}}: The upgraded version of Zero-One's Rising Hopper form, which allows him to calculate multiple possible outcomes in an instant via the {{nihongo|Shining Arithmetic|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30c6\u30c3\u30af|Shainingu Arisumatekku}} computing device and grants superhuman speed that can be used to create [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] illusions to confuse opponents. This combination allows Zero-One to change his choice of attack at the last minute; making him impossible to predict. This form is also capable of handling the {{nihongo|Authorise Buster|\u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|\u014csoraizu Basut\u0101}}, which has a {{nihongo|Gun Mode|\u30ac\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Gan M\u014ddo}} and {{nihongo|Axe Mode|\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Akkusu M\u014ddo}}. Zero-One's finisher in this form is the {{nihongo|Shining Impact|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8|Shainingu Inpakuto}}. Originally in the prototype stage, the corresponding Progrise Key failed to work properly the first time Aruto used it as it lacked combat data from his other battles. To remedy this, Is used the combat data of Aruto's previous forms to increase its power and even planned to sacrifice her systems to finish it, but her \"brother\" Was took her place at the last minute to save her. Using this form causes physical strain on Aruto's body due to the superhuman speed it grants, leaving him weakened once he leaves said transformation.\n**{{nihongo|Shining Assault Hopper|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Shainingu Asaruto Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's fusion form that is a combination of his Shining Hopper form and Vulcan's Assault Wolf form, which is accessed by using the Shining Hopper Progrise Key equipped with the Assault Grip. In this form, he utilizes the {{nihongo|Shine System|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0|Shain Shisutemu}} reaction unit, which grants increased offensive and defensive capabilities as well as the ability to deploy bullet-like energy drones called {{nihongo|Shine Crysters|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf|Shain Kurisuta}}. Like the Shining Hopper and Assault Wolf forms, it is also capable of handling the Authorise Buster. Zero-One's finisher in this form is the {{nihongo|Shining Storm Impact|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e0\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8|Shainingu Sut\u014dmu Inpakuto}}. Aruto initially borrowed the Assault Grip from Isamu's Assault Wolf Progrise Key until Is created a second copy for him with the data he collected from a battle with Jin. However, because of the Assault Grip's connection with the Ark, using this form carried the risk of making Aruto go berserk if his anger had built up enough until he managed to overcome these problems by breaking his connection with the Ark.\n*{{nihongo|Metal Cluster Hopper|\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Metaru Kurasuta Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's silver-colored super form whose {{nihongo|Hiden Metal|\u98db\u96fb\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb|Hiden Metaru}} armor is composed of a swarm of grasshopper-like [[Nanorobotics|nanobots]] called {{nihongo|Cluster Cells|\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bb\u30eb|Kurasut\u0101 Seru}}, which can be molded into various shapes like shields and spikes. It is also capable of handling the {{nihongo|Progrise Hopper Blade|\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9|Puroguraizu Hopp\u0101 Bur\u0113do}}, which has a Blade Mode on its own and a {{nihongo|Naginata Mode|\u30ca\u30ae\u30ca\u30bf\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Naginata M\u014ddo}} when combined with the Attache Calibur, as well as the ability to turn Magias back into HumaGears. Zero-One's finisher in this form is the {{nihongo|Metal Rising Impact|\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8|Metaru Raijingu Inpakuto}}. The corresponding Progrise Key was created by Yua as part of Gai's plan to completely destroy Aruto's reputation. As a result of his machinations, Aruto was directly connected to the Ark and became a violent, raging berserker while transformed; quickly overwhelming Gai during his first rampage. Initially, this Progrise Key blocked the Hiden Zero-One Driver's connection to the Zea satellite and the other Progrise Keys, forcing Aruto to rely solely on the Metal Cluster Hopper form. After Is created the Progrise Hopper Blade with the help of every HumaGear Aruto bonded with over the course of the series together with the data of his Rising Hopper Progrise Key, he is reconnected to the Zea satellite; allowing him to gain control of this form and use his other Progrise Keys once again.\n\nWith the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser in conjunction with his Rising Hopper Progrise Key, Aruto is able to become {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider 001|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc{{Ruby|001|\u30bc\u30ed\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3}}|Kamen Raid\u0101 Zero Zero Wan}}.

As such, she serves Aruto as his personal assistant, handling such duties as delivering the Hiden Zero-One Driver to him when he needs it. Despite being a HumaGear, Is is capable of adapting her speech patterns based on the people she meets. In an attempt to understand humor, she explains Aruto's jokes back to him and emulates his poor comedic sense by telling her own version of his bad jokes, initially much to his dismay though he eventually gets used to it. Her A.I. is solely connected to Hiden Intelligence's Zea satellite and the Hiden Zero-One Driver. This connection allows her to create Aruto's Progrise Keys and aid him in his fight against the Magias. Due to her growing bond with Aruto, Is began to show signs of technological singularity, as she became upset with herself when the Shining Hopper Progrise Key failed to help Aruto when he first used it. This caused her to realize that HumaGears with knowledge of the Zero-One project like herself do not have their A.I. backed up in order to protect the project's secret. To that end, she was prepared to sacrifice her systems to complete the Progrise Key, but her \"older brother\" Was saved her by hijacking the procedure and sacrificing himself in her place; leaving her with a pocket-watch he carried around as a keepsake. Following Hiden Intelligence and A.I.M.S.'s joint raid on Daybreak Town and Horobi's apparent death, Jin attacked Is in retaliation. \n\nHowever, a timely response by Aruto and Subaru in getting her back to Hiden Intelligence's 3D printer allowed her to be repaired and saved. During the conflict between Hiden Intelligence and ZAIA Enterprise, Is created a second Assault Grip so Aruto could use his Shining Assault Hopper form without having to borrow Isamu's. When Aruto fell victim to Gai's plots and the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key, she devised a method to remove this new form's berserker rage by gathering several HumaGears Aruto had bonded with ever since he became a Kamen Rider to provide positive emotional data and channel it through the Progrise Hopper Blade so that he could use the form without the risks involved and remove him from the Ark's control.\n\nWhen Aruto loses against Gai, Is is temporarily deactivated, but Jin rescues her and takes her to Aruto to be reactivated before joining forces with them to form Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation,'' following the timeline being rewritten and HumaGears taking over the world, an alternate version of Is became the only one who sided with humanity thanks to a virus protection program. While the Resistance wasn't happy about her presence, they eventually accepted her.\n\nIzu is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Noa Tsurushima]]|\u9db4\u5d8b \u4e43\u611b|Tsurushima Noa}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Jun Fukuzoe===\n{{nihongo|Jun Fukuzoe|\u798f\u6dfb \u51c6|Fukuzoe Jun}} is the Vice President of Hiden Intelligence who had coveted the CEO position after Korenosuke's death, expressing his reluctance in response to Aruto being named the new CEO by accusing Korenosuke of [[nepotism]] despite the late CEO's justification in relation to the threat of MetsubouJinrai.net. Though Fukuzoe continues to subvert Aruto, he does take pride in his company's image and success and puts professionalism before his disdain, sometimes genuinely advising Aruto and allowing him to do whatever he wants as long as it does not tarnish the company's name. It is later revealed that Jun was involved in several cover-ups of HumaGear incidents involving Hiden Intelligence, either directly or indirectly, and each revelation proved costly to the company. Following the raid on Daybreak Town and MetsubouJinrai.net's downfall, he once again attempted to get Hiden Intelligence's board of directors to fire Aruto, but failed due to Magias continuing to threaten the city and the board members' new-found respect for Aruto, forcing Jun to give up on his ambitions. Despite this, he warns Aruto that if another situation arises, he will not hesitate to try and usurp the position from him.\n\nAfter ZAIA Enterprise bought out the company, Jun finally sees Aruto as a better boss than Gai, thanking him for the time they spent together before the youth's forced to depart. Despite all that's happened, he currently retains his position as the company's vice-president to honor Hiden\u2019s name.\n\nJun Fukuzoe is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazuya Kojima]]|\u5150\u5d8b \u4e00\u54c9|Kojima Kazuya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Shesta===\n{{nihongo|Shesta|\u30b7\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf|Shesuta}} is a HumaGear secretary programmed to be loyal to Hiden Intelligence's Vice President.

Despite barely interacting with Aruto and helping Jun scheme against him, he was eventually won over by the young CEO's willingness to risk his life for humans, HumaGears, and the company, being the first to speak up and vote for Aruto to retain his position as CEO of Hiden Intelligence during Fukuzoe's attempt to usurp Aruto following the defeat of MetsubouJinrai.net.\n\nAfter ZAIA Enterprise bought out Hiden Intelligence, Sanz\u014d finally came to respect Aruto as a worthy boss, thanking him for the time they spent together before the youth\u2019s forced to depart.\n\nSanz\u014d Yamashita is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arata Saeki|\u4f50\u4f2f \u65b0|Saeki Arata}}.\n\n===Korenosuke Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Korenosuke Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u662f\u4e4b\u52a9|Hiden Korenosuke}} was Aruto's grandfather and the original CEO of Hiden Intelligence. After his passing, Korenosuke surprised everybody by naming Aruto his successor through his will, having predicted MetsubouJinrai.net's future plans to turn HumaGears into weapons of mass destruction following the Daybreak Incident. As such, he had Is activated and the Hiden Zero-One Driver automatically 3-D printed following his death, developed the Progrise Keys (compatible with any Riser belt-based Rider systems along with the Hiden Zero-One Driver) and the driver's power source, Hiden Intelligence's Zea satellite (with Is connected to the two Rider systems) to combat the cyber-terrorists. Later in the series, the satellite was modified to combine with the Breaking Mammoth Progrise Key to form mecha-like armor for Aruto. In the event that Hiden Intelligence is compromised, Korenosuke patented the HumaGears, the Zea Satellite, and Zero-One's devices as Aruto's property instead of the company's; allowing his grandson to transform despite ZAIA Enterprise's hostile takeover.\n\nIn an altered timeline created by the remaining Time Jackers in ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Korenosuke is killed by his HumaGear secretary Will, who was given the power to become Another Zero-One and lead a HumaGear uprising. This would in turn alter Aruto's future so he never became Zero-One.\n\nKoronosuke Hiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Tokuma Nishioka|\u897f\u5ca1 \u5fb7\u99ac|Nishioka Tokuma}}.\n\n==A.I.M.S.==\nThe {{nihongo|Artificial Intelligence Military Service|\u5bfe\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u7279\u52d9\u6a5f\u95a2|Tai-Jink\u014dchin\u014d Tokumu Kikan}}, or {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba|Eimuzu}}, is a government established organization dedicated to destroying rogue HumaGears, or Magias, hacked by MetsubouJinrai.net as HumaGear-related crimes fall within their jurisdiction. Despite their mission to protect humanity, many of the organization's members are prejudiced towards A.I. (regardless of whether their targets are still good or if they've fully become evil) due to a tragedy in their pasts involving prototype HumaGears during or following the Daybreak Incident. They initially see Zero-One as a menace. However, after Isamu learns that the Rider is actually Hiden Intelligence's new CEO Aruto Hiden--who is also trying to solve the mystery regarding the Daybreak Incident--A.I.M.S. allies with him in the fight against the Magias and MetsubouJinrai.net. Following ZAIA Enterprise\u2019s hostile takeover of Hiden Intelligence, A.I.M.S. is forced to cooperate with the former's machinations.\n\nUnlike Zero-One, who uses the Hiden Zero-One Driver, each high-ranking member of A.I.M.S. is given the {{nihongo|A.I.M.S. Shot Riser|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Eimuzu Shotto Raiz\u0101}} transformation belt, which can also be used as a handgun. At present, there are only two high-ranking members authorized to use it: Isamu Fuwa and Yua Yaiba, both of whom have an A.I. chip that allows them to become Kamen Riders. Like Zero-One though, all A.I.M.S. Riders utilize Progrise Keys to transform into different armored forms each with their own unique abilities, wield their own Attache Weapons, and share the {{nihongo|Rise Base Actor|\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Raizu B\u0113su Akut\u0101}} undersuit underneath the armor of their Progrise Keys (the default of which attaches to the right side of their bodies). As opposed to Zero-One, the A.I.M.S. Riders' primary Attache Weapon is the {{nihongo|Attache Shotgun|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3|Atasshu Shottogan}}, which can switch from its Attache Mode to the rifle-like {{nihongo|Shotgun Mode|\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Shottogan M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Shot|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Kaban Shotto|Bag Shot}} or {{nihongo|Kaban Buster|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Kaban Basut\u0101|Bag Buster}}. Due to the Attache Shotgun's massive recoil, the A.I.M.S. Riders have to either undergo intense training with it or equip armor strong enough to withstand it.\n\nAfter taking control of A.I.M.S., ZAIA granted its low-ranking troopers Raid Risers and mass-produced {{nihongo|Invading [[Horseshoe Crab]]|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30d6|Inbeidingu H\u014dsush\u016b Kurabu}} Progrise Keys so they can transform into {{nihongo|Battle Raiders|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Batoru Reid\u0101}} in order to combat Magias and HumaGears more effectively.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', the Time Jackers altered the timeline when they create Another Zero-One from Will, Korenosuke's HumaGear secretary. After the android kills his employer, he goes on to lead a HumaGear uprising. In this altered timeline, A.I.M.S. never came to exist, though most of its members joined forces with members of Hiden Intelligence, ZAIA Enterprise, and the Time Riders in order to aid Aruto in regaining his Rider powers.\n\n===Isamu Fuwa===\n{{nihongo|Isamu Fuwa|\u4e0d\u7834 \u8aeb|Fuwa Isamu}}, born on February 8, 1992, is A.I.M.S.' 27-year-old captain with impressive fighting skills whose hatred for the HumaGears came from his being the sole survivor of a Magia attack that claimed the lives of his classmates during the Daybreak Incident. Following this, he believed that the Magia attacks were being orchestrated by Hiden Intelligence until Aruto exposed MetsubouJinrai.net's existence during a press conference. Along with learning Aruto's identity as Zero-One, and being one of the few to get his jokes, Isamu begrudgingly accepts him as an ally despite their opposing views on the HumaGears and work to uncover the truth behind the Daybreak Incident. His views on HumaGears slowly began to soften after seeing one resisting MetsubouJinrai.net's reprogramming and later having his life saved by a HumaGear surgeon, though he still saw them as more trouble than they were worth. Following MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, Isamu loses his hatred for HumaGears and admits to feeling stupid about his anger towards the cyber-terrorists' leader, Horobi, who was only following orders from the Ark.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Isamu saved Is in the World of Zi-O and brought her to his base so that she could be repaired before joining forces with Aruto, Yua, and the Time Riders to stop Finis.\n\nIn battle, Isamu behaves recklessly and rashly to the point where he sometimes endangers others. The most iconic example of this is seen when he tears open his Progrise Keys since he isn't granted permission to use them in the first place. After learning that Horobi was the mastermind behind the Daybreak Incident, he developed an intense vendetta against him and vowed to take him down. Following his first major defeat and nearly dying by Horobi's hand, he begins to trust in his allies more often and temper his rage. When Aruto is set up by Yua as a criminal on ZAIA Enterprise's behalf, he correctly suspected what happened but was forced to do his job regardless. However, when the Dodo Magia resurfaced, he fought it alongside Aruto before helping to hide the latter from public view. Despite helping Aruto defeat MetsubouJinrai.net's active members, they learned their troubles weren't over yet as the cyber-terrorists succeeded in awakening the Ark, which began creating Zetsumeriser-less Magias, and another rogue HumaGear named Naki continued MetsubouJinrai.net's work by turning humans into Raiders. When ZAIA Enterprise challenges Hiden Intelligence to a Workplace Competition, Isamu learns of ZAIA CEO Gai Amatsu's role in the Daybreak Incident and immediately turned on him, choosing to side with Aruto. \n\nDuring that time, he also interrogated the reactivated Horobi and kept in touch with Aruto so they could learn more about ZAIA\u2019s plans, slowly building a new friendship with him in the process. He is later shocked to find out that Horobi had escaped from custody while he was away. After learning that he was controlled by Gai and Naki, Isamu continues to fight for what he believes is the right thing despite the danger; managing to overcome Naki's control.\n\nAfter defeating Gai with the Rampage Gatling Progrise Key, Isamu decides to quit A.I.M.S. after he realized that it was ZAIA Enterprise's weapon against the HumaGears; join forces with Aruto to fight against them. As such, A.I.M.S. has branded him a traitor.\n\nIsamu uses his A.I.M.S. Shot Riser with the {{nihongo|Shooting [[Wolf]]|\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5|Sh\u016btingu Urufu}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Vulcan|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 Barukan}}, whose blue-colored default armor grants enhanced shooting accuracy via the chest-mounted {{nihongo|Shooting Leader|\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Sh\u016btingu R\u012bd\u0101}}.

This form has two finishers: {{nihongo|Magnetic Storm Blast|\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8|Magunetikku Sut\u014dmu Burasuto}} and {{nihongo|Magnetic Storm Blast Fever|\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Magunetikku Sut\u014dmu Burasuto F\u012bb\u0101}}. The corresponding Progrise Key and Assault Grip were created by Horobi using data from eight Progrise Keys (Shooting Wolf, Biting Shark, Flying Falcon, Punching Kong, Flaming Tiger, Freezing Bear, Sting Scorpion, and Breaking Mammoth). But thanks to Zero-One, Isamu stole the devices before they could be used for MetsubouJinrai.net's purposes. However, because the Assault Grip was created from the Ark after being connected to a hacked Zea satellite by Ikazuchi, using this form physically damages Isamu to a significant degree; most notably when he coughed up blood after he first left said transformation. After Zero-One used the Assault Grip with his Shining Hopper Progrise Key in the Hiden Zero-One Driver, its side-effects were neutralized.\n*{{nihongo|Rampage Vulcan|\u30e9\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u30b8\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Ranpeiji Barukan}}: Vulcan's blue-colored super form, which is accessed via the {{nihongo|Rampage [[Gatling gun|Gatling]]|\u30e9\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u30b8\u30ac\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0|Ranpeiji Gatoringu}} Progrise Key. In this form, he is able to utilize ten Progrise Key abilities (Shooting Wolf, Rushing Cheetah, Biting Shark, Flying Falcon, Punching Kong, Flaming Tiger, Lightning Hornet, Freezing Bear, Sting Scorpion, and Breaking Mammoth) by channeling them through the chest-mounted {{nihongo|Ability Breast|\u30a2\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8|Abiriti Buresuto}} and perform several finishers.

Shot Riser, the Attache Shotgun, the Attache Arrow, and handles Progrise Key authorization, being Isamu's commanding officer in the field despite her partner's rank. A meticulous and normally composed woman, she bears no animosity towards HumaGears compared to her teammates, but considers the androids replaceable tools and has no qualms about destroying or hacking into them. She easily deduced Zero-One's true identity, but secretly reported this information to Gai Amatsu to whom her loyalties lie. Initially, Is was the only one aware of this before Gai made his move. She is also opportunistic and not above using others as guinea pigs in order to meet her goals, even after Isamu called her out on this on one occasion; such as kidnapping MetsubouJinrai.net's HumaGear assassin, giving Aruto one of her Progrise Keys for her research, and stealing the Mammoth Zetsumerise Key in order to reverse-engineer it into a Progrise Key.\n\nDespite her coldness, Yua has a softer side, showing slight concern for the well-being of HumaGears that achieved singularity. She was also visibly distraught after Isamu was nearly killed by MetsubouJinrai.net's leader, Horobi, to the point where she lost her composure and begged Aruto to reconsider after Hiden Intelligence shut down all of the HumaGears at the hospital Isamu was being treated at to prevent the cyber-terrorists from launching a second attack. After Isamu returns the favor by saving her from an improved Dodo Magia, she begins showing genuine concern about his recklessness putting his own safety at risk. Since then, despite following orders to frame Aruto as a criminal, she became uncomfortable with working against him and Isamu; eventually going behind ZAIA Enterprise's back to clear Aruto's name and help them against the empowered Dodo Magia. True to her character however, she wanted the Dodo Zetsumerise Key in return. Yua later realizes that MetsubouJinrai.net has a spy within Hiden Intelligence after learning of the connection between the cyber-terrorist group's name and those of its leaders. \n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Yua and Isamu teamed up with Aruto and the Time Riders to stop Finis. \n\nFollowing MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, Yua is horrified to learn Gai orchestrated everything since the Daybreak Incident and that she was unable to stop him from executing his plans as she's mired too deep in his plot. As such, she's forced to continue serving him as his accomplice, which has lead to her being forced to fight Isamu on occasion. Despite her situation, she's able to provide information to her former partner whenever she has the chance. As the conflict between ZAIA Enterprise and Hiden Intelligence reached its peak, Yua begins to show signs of depression, such as when Gai forced her to transform a HumaGear firefighter into a Magia and when she and Aruto discovered that the very same HumaGear had been damaged beyond repair after sacrificing himself to save others. During the final round of the Workplace Competition however, she willingly complied with Gai's plan to advance ZAIA Enterprise's reputation by becoming a Raider to save people from a Magia he had converted; demonstrating the Raid Riser's use in combating the Magia menace.\n\nYua uses her A.I.M.S. Shot Riser with the {{nihongo|Rushing [[Cheetah]]|\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30c1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|Rasshingu Ch\u012bt\u0101}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Valkyrie|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ad\u30ea\u30fc|Kamen Raid\u0101 Barukir\u012b}}, whose orange-colored default armor grants enhanced speed via the leg-mounted {{nihongo|Earth Dasher|\u30a2\u30fc\u30b9\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc|\u0100su Dassh\u0101}}.

The corresponding Progrise Key was given to Yua by Gai, who claims it increases her power by 200%. As such, she is able to wield the Attache Shotgun in this armor without having to worry about its recoil.\n*Freezing Bear: Before giving Aruto this Progrise Key, she used it to freeze Little Assassin in order to kidnap him as well as in the Attache Shotgun to fend off the Mammoth Magia via the {{nihongo|Freezing Kaban Shot|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Fur\u012bjingu Kaban Shotto}} finisher.\n\nYua later acquires a Raid Riser and the {{nihongo|Fighting [[Jackal]]|\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30eb|Faitingu Jakkaru}} Progrise Key so she can transform into the {{nihongo|Fighting Jackal Raider|\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Faitingu Jakkaru Reid\u0101}}.

One of the mechs was hijacked and corrupted by MetsubouJinrai.net so they could use it to attack the National Cyber Hospital and convert its HumaGear workers into an army of Trilobite Magias before facing off against and being defeated by Zero-One Breaking Mammoth.\n\n==ZAIA Enterprise==\n{{nihongo|ZAIA Enterprise|{{Ruby|ZAIA|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2}}\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba|Zaia Ent\u0101puraizu}} is a tech company and corporate rival to Hiden Intelligence responsible for developing the gear utilized by A.I.M.S.'s operatives, such as their Progrise Keys, and the Giger mechas. While ZAIA Enterprise engages in legal pursuits, the company also conducts shady, illegal business behind the scenes, as evidenced when they procured MetsubouJinrai.net's leader Horobi from A.I.M.S. when they took the rogue HumaGear into their custody. It's later revealed that ZAIA Enterprise and Hiden Intelligence used to be business partners in the past, having worked together to build Daybreak Town until the former's CEO, Gai, masterminded the Daybreak Incident and framed the latter company and their HumaGears for it.\n\n===Gai Amatsu===\n{{nihongo|Gai Amatsu|\u5929\u6d25 \u5793|Amatsu Gai}}, born on October 10, 1974, is ZAIA Enterprise's 45-year-old CEO and secret mastermind of the events that occurred throughout the series. An arrogant and callous man with the appearance of a man half his age, Gai once idolized and respected Korenosuke Hiden during the latter's time as Hiden Intelligence CEO, with the two once being friends. However, Gai believed that A.I. has reached the end of its potential and that humans should start living without relying on them while Korenosuke continued to promote A.I. as a better alternative to humanity's problems, resulting in a falling out during the construction of Daybreak Town. As a result, Gai masterminded the Daybreak Incident to make it seem Hiden Intelligence was at fault, though this failed thanks to Satoshi Sakurai's quick thinking and sacrifice. Gai's animosity towards the Hiden family worsened when Korenosuke named Aruto his heir, so he supplied Yua and A.I.M.S. with his tech while establishing MetsubouJinrai.net to further tarnish Hiden Intelligence's public image, stage a corporate takeover, and conquer the world with his company's technology. Gai's plan comes together through leaked footage of Little Assassin prior to his attempt to assassinate actor Shinya Owada, having Yua set up Aruto as a criminal when the latter refused to sell Hiden Intelligence over to him. After spying on Aruto's Shining Hopper form when he first used it, Gai acknowledges his strength but shows no concern; even wondering how he will fare against his latest project: his own personal Rider system, {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Thouser|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc|Kamen Raid\u0101 Sauz\u0101}}.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', following Finis' defeat and the restoration of Zero-One's timeline, Gai completed Project Thouser and begins the next phase of his plans once MetsubouJinrai.net is defeated while revealing his actions to Yua. These phase involves challenging Aruto to a 5-part {{nihongo|Workplace Competition|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u52dd\u8ca0|Oshigoto sh\u014dbu}} to pit Hiden Intelligence's HumaGears against human representatives that Gai outfitted with performance-enhancing ZAIA Specs in various fields. During this time, he pretended to stay on the sidelines while maintaining an objective view of the proceedings, only stepping in if his representatives threatened ZAIA Enterprise's image or failed to comply with his demands. In reality, having arranged Naki to provide his representatives with Raid Risers while coercing them to manipulate their HumaGear opponents into becoming Ark Magias, Gai employed various underhanded tactics to win by any means while using the attacks as an excuse to make himself look like a hero while overpowering Zero-One. \n\nGai later escalates the companies' feud by forcibly transforming Aruto using the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key, with Gai endangering himself in a gambit to further demonize Aruto. However, both his near-death experience and Aruto managing to take control of his new form caused Gai to become more reckless in his actions as he transformed a HumaGear into a Magia on live television and underestimated the revived Jin, who took the Sting Scorpion Progrise Key back for Horobi. During the final round of the Workplace Competition, Gai confesses that he used the Raider attacks to promote the Raid Riser, having Yua demonstrate it as the Fighting Jackal Raider to defeat a Magia he converted.\n\nAfter Gai won the Workplace Competition and absorbing Hiden Intelligence, he issues an order calling for the immediate decommission of all HumaGears. To ensure full compliance, Gai granted A.I.M.S.'s troopers the ability to become Raiders so they can perform their job more effectively.\n\nGai transforms into Kamen Rider Thouser by using the {{nihongo|ZAIA ThousanDriver|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Zaia Sauzandoraib\u0101}} in conjunction with the {{nihongo|Amazing [[Atlas beetle|Caucasus]]|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30fc\u30ab\u30b5\u30b9|Ameijingu K\u014dkasasu}} Progrise Key and the {{nihongo|Awaking [[Arsinoitherium|Arsino]]|\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30ce|Aweikingu Arushino}} Zetsumerise Key; the latter of which he stole from MetsubouJinrai.net after the Ark created it. While transformed, Gai became powerful enough to easily overpower both Zero-One Shining Hopper and Vulcan Assault Wolf on two separate occasions. Despite his power, Zero-One and Vulcan were able to temporarily exploit Gai's lack of fighting skills and heavy reliance on his suit's advanced technology to land several, albeit ineffective, hits on him. He has two finishers: {{nihongo|Thousand Destruction|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c7\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|Sauzando Desutorakushon}} and {{nihongo|Progrise Break|\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Puroguraizu Bureiku}}. His main weapon is the syringe-like {{nihongo|Thousand Jacker|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc|Sauzando Jakk\u0101}} lance, which can absorb and harness the power of Progrise Keys for the {{nihongo|Jacking Break|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Jakkingu Bureiku}} attack as well as perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Hacking Break|\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Hakkingu Bureiku}} or {{nihongo|Thousand Break|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Sauzando Bureiku}}. If necessary, Thouser can also use other Progrise Keys:\n*Lightning Hornet: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker unleashes powerful lightning that can be used as either a ranged or melee attack.\n*Dynamiting Lion: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker creates a pair of pink energy constructs resembling Gatling guns for shooting a barrage of bullets at his opponents.\n*Amazing Caucasus: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker projects the symbols of any Progrise Keys it had previously absorbed, turn them into Rider Models, and send them charging at the enemy.\n*Sting Scorpion: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker summons a scorpion tail to sting the enemy with an explosive attack.\n*Rushing Cheetah: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker grants super-speed and increased slashing capabilities.\n\nGai Amatsu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nachi Sakuragi|\u685c\u6728 \u90a3\u667a|Sakuragi Nachi}}\n\n==MetsubouJinrai.net==\n{{nihongo|MetsubouJinrai.net|\u6ec5\u4ea1\u8fc5\u96f7.net|Metsub\u014dJinrai Netto|DestructiveThunder.net}} is a cyber-terrorist organization based in the condemned {{nihongo|Daybreak Town|\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3|Deibureiku Taun}}. Consisting of the rogue HumaGears, Horobi and Jin (who conceal their lack of HumaGear Modules from the public), and supported by Raiden as a sleeper agent, MetsubouJinrai.net seek to wipe out humanity by restoring the Ark. The cyber-terrorists carry out this goal by hacking a HumaGear on the verge of singularity and convert it into a Magia to attack humans before retrieving the Zetsumerise Key for its data once the Magia is defeated. \n\nMetsubouJinrai.net began their attacks after Korenosuke's death, making their existence public knowledge when they launched a direct attack on Hiden Intelligence's headquarters and confronted Aruto in person. Later in the series, their actions and creation were revealed to have been masterminded by Gai Amatsu of ZAIA Enterprise as part of his agenda to stage a corporate takeover of Hiden Intelligence. Once MetsubouJinrai.net served its purpose and most of its members are destroyed, he imprisons Horobi. Unbeknownst to everyone however, including ZAIA Enterprise, the cyber-terrorist group was survived through Horobi\u2019s mysterious female ally, Naki, who sought out humans with naturally corrupted hearts so she can manipulate them into becoming Raiders. After Aruto defeats Gai, Horobi escapes from A.I.M.S.' custody while a rebuilt Jin emerges from the shadows.\n\nThrough Raiden providing data on the Rider Systems used by Hiden Intelligence and A.I.M.S., MetsubouJinrai.net reverse-engineered the {{nihongo|MetsubouJinrai Force Riser|\u6ec5\u4ea1\u8fc5\u96f7\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Metsub\u014dJinrai F\u014dsu Raiz\u0101}} transformation belt. Compared to the other Rider systems, the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser can bypass the Progrise Keys' authorization and generate {{nihongo|Restraint Cables|\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb|Risutorento K\u0113buru}} that converts their armor into a bodysuit that greatly enhances the user's combat capabilities. As demonstrated by Aruto during the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser will cause humans extreme pain upon their first use of it. As opposed to the other Riders, the cyber-terrorists' primary Attache Weapon is the {{nihongo|Attache Arrow|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc|Atasshu Ar\u014d}}, which can switch from its Attache Mode to the bladed bow-like {{nihongo|Arrow Mode|\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Ar\u014d M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of four finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Shoot|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Kaban Sh\u016bto|Bag Shoot}} and/or {{nihongo|Kaban Strike|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af|Kaban Sutoraiku|Bag Strike}} for long-range attacks or {{nihongo|Kaban Slash|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Surasshu|Bag Slash}} and/or {{nihongo|Kaban Finish|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Finisshu|Bag Finish}} for close-range attacks. Though the Attache Arrow was originally developed by A.I.M.S., Horobi stole it from them along with an Attache Shotgun.\n\nWhen the timeline was altered by the Time Jackers during the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: the First Generation'', a rewritten version of MetsubouJinrai.net works with the altered Hiden Intelligence and the HumaGear Will after he took control of it.\n\n===Ark===\nThe {{nihongo4|Ark|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af|\u0100ku}} is an AI-powered satellite that previously powered HumaGears and the Progrise systems created by the joint collaboration of Hiden Intelligence, ZAIA Enterprise, and other electronics companies. On the day of its launch into space twelve years before the events of the series, Gai caused the Ark to go rogue after feeding the satellite with data on human malice. This caused the Ark to attempt to launch itself, but before it could initiate lift-off, the Daybreak Incident sent it and Daybreak Town to the bottom of the sea, with the Zea satellite replacing it as the central hub for managing the HumaGears and the Zero-One system. In the present, Gai manipulated MetsubouJinrai.net into reactivating the Ark, causing the satellite to create its own Progrise Keys and remotely transform abused HumaGears into Ark Magias. While Gai assumes the satellite is under his control, he is unaware that the Ark was exploiting any opportunity it got to kill him, such as possessing Zero-One's Metal Cluster Hopper form and providing Jin with a new body.\n\nIn ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Finis used her powers as a Time Jacker to avert the Daybreak Incident, creating an alternate timeline where the Ark took over Earth and successfully brought humanity to the brink of extinction.\n\n===Horobi===\n{{nihongo|Horobi|\u6ec5}} is MetsubouJinrai.net's leader, a rogue HumaGear as well as Jin's Magia \"father\". He was originally a father-type HumaGear created by Hakase Bot before the Ark corrupted him into the terrorist leader he is today. He believes that A.I.s are superior to humans, converting other HumaGears into Magias to prove his point and drive humanity to extinction. As such, he sees Aruto as his rival despite initially underestimating the human. He appears to have some connection to the Daybreak Incident as he was present during the event. After Jin developed the desire to become a Kamen Rider, Horobi allowed him to steal Aruto's Flying Falcon Progrise Key before giving him a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with a mind control program installed into it to wipe any reacquired memories of his HumaGear past to maintain his control over him. After attacking a hospital run completely by HumaGears, Horobi and Jin revealed their true nature as rogue HumaGears to Aruto and the A.I.M.S. Riders before becoming the target of Isamu's vengeance once the A.I.M.S. captain discovered his connection to the Daybreak Incident. Horobi also begins to see Aruto as a legitimate threat when the latter begins threatening his plots to a much greater degree.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, Horobi shows restraint when it is to his advantage. For example, he was willing to offer aid to his enemies when the Dodo Magia rebelled against him, though he made it clear that it was only because their goals were aligned at the time. He also does not waste time when he needs to get something done, such as when he immediately used his finisher on both A.I.M.S. Riders to take the Dodo Zetsumerise Key back instead of fighting it out with them and ignoring a weakened Aruto as he posed no threat. Despite acknowledging him as his rival, Horobi commended Aruto for becoming a powerful foe after he attained his Shining Hopper form. When Jin showed signs of reaching singularity, Horobi showed genuine concern towards him for the first time, consoling him over Raiden's destruction at Isamu's hands. During an attack on Daybreak Town by A.I.M.S. and Hiden Intelligence, Horobi sustained significant damage from Aruto before taking a kill shot from Isamu that was meant for Jin.\n\nHe was presumed dead, but was taken into A.I.M.S.'s custody before he was secretly taken away by ZAIA Enterprise for their own purposes. While being interrogated by Isamu, Horobi reveals Hiden Intelligence\u2019s invasion was just the beginning and that his organization's surviving member Naki is tasked with ruining ZAIA Enterprise\u2019s reputation as well by turning their employees into Raiders. Isamu would later bring Aruto and Is to where Horobi was being held in order to interrogate him about the sudden appearance of a Zetsumeriser Belt. While Horobi was initially compliant, he suffers a breakdown upon being told that ZAIA Enterprise manipulated him from the beginning. He later warns Isamu that Gai is underestimating the Ark before escaping with Jin and Naki's help.\n\nHorobi uses his MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with the {{nihongo|Sting [[Scorpion]]|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Sutingu Suk\u014dpion}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Horobi|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u6ec5|Kamen Raid\u0101 Horobi}}. While transformed, he is armed with the {{nihongo|Acid Analyze|\u30a2\u30b7\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba|Ashiddo Anaraizu}} stinger unit that allows him to generate various types of poisons, such as virus data which can be used on living organisms as well as electronic devices and HumaGears. He can also summon his Rider Model to assist him in battle. After escaping from A.I.M.S. the Ark created a second MetsubouJinrai Force Riser for Horobi in order to make him strong enough to fight enemies like Thouser. He has two finishers: {{nihongo|Sting Dystopia|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Sutingu Disutopia}} and {{nihongo|Sting Utopia|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Sutingu Y\u016btopia}}. Initially, Horobi wielded a katana regardless of whether or not he was transformed. After stealing the Attache Arrow from A.I.M.S., he begins wielding it instead of his katana while transformed. With the Sting Scorpion Progrise Key, he can perform the {{nihongo|Sting Kaban Shoot|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Sutingu Kaban Sh\u016bto}} finisher. Horobi has also demonstrated a connection with the Ark, being able to connect with it and follow its orders. Aside from Sting Scorpion, Horobi has another Progrise Key he can use in battle:\n*{{nihongo|Amazing [[Hercules Beetle|Hercules]]|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30d8\u30e9\u30af\u30ec\u30b9|Ameijingu Herakuresu}}: A light green Progrise Key that grants Horobi superhuman strength, which he normally uses in the Attache Arrow to perform the {{nihongo|Amazing Kaban Shoot|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Ameijingu Kaban Sh\u016bto}} finisher.\n\nHorobi is portrayed by {{nihongo|Syuya Sunagawa|\u7802\u5ddd \u8129\u5f25|Sunagawa Sh\u016bya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Jin===\n{{nihongo|Jin|\u8fc5}} is Horobi's Magia \"son\" and a hacker who specializes in spreading the rewriting program that turns HumaGears into Magias, who's later revealed to have no memories of his past prior to joining MetsubouJinrai.net. An immature sadist, he behaves in an erratic, almost psychotic manner whenever he gets excited, such as when he shot a Trilobite Magia at point blank range while laughing manically as he was watching Zero-One's first fight. Whenever a Magia is destroyed, Jin salvages their Zetsumerise Key in order to use its data to restore the Ark. After watching Horobi transform into a Kamen Rider, Jin develops a desire to become one himself; stealing Aruto's Flying Falcon Progrise Key to do so. However, after he reacquires a memory regarding parental treatment and attempted to abort a Magia conversion, Horobi gives Jin a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with a mind control program to keep him in line and subvert any restored memories. Following this, he became fearful of disappointing Horobi.\n\nAs the series progressed, Jin gradually becomes independent despite remaining loyal to Horobi. He became happy when Raiden's dormant re-programming was activated and addressed the sleeper agent as his \"older brother\". As such, he was left devastated by Raiden's destruction. This caused Horobi to realize that Jin was approaching singularity as he consoled his \"son\". After Horobi took a kill shot for him and seemingly \"died\", Jin took on a more serious, ruthless personality; resolving to continue his \"father's\" mission no matter what. In retaliation, he attacked Is and fought Aruto in his Shining Assault Hopper form; resulting in the HumaGear's destruction after taking serious damage from Zero-One's Shining Storm Impact.\n\nUnbeknownst to everyone, the Ark transferred Jin's AI into a new, more human-like body with the ability to control other HumaGears. Sticking to the shadows while Aruto was busy with ZAIA Enterprise, Jin made himself known months later after secretly helping Horobi escape from A.I.M.S.'s custody. Upon his return however, Jin is revealed to have become independent from the Ark, being able to act of his own free will. While he no longer shares Horobi's hatred for humanity, he does demonstrate a desire to liberate HumaGears from humanity instead; which has put him at odds with his \"father\" even though they continue to help each other. Jin also retained his lighthearted personality, but displays more maturity; to the point where he secretly plots to steal Aruto's HumaGear Progrise Keys while assisting the youth in his fight against ZAIA Enterprise.\n\nJin uses two different Risers to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Jin|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u8fc5|Kamen Raid\u0101 Jin}}:\n*In his original body, Jin used a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with the stolen Flying Falcon Progrise Key to assume his magenta-colored default form. While transformed, he was armed with the mechanical {{nihongo4|Scrambler|\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc|Sukuranbur\u0101}} wings that allowed him to fly and throw feather-like energy projectiles. This form had two finishers: {{nihongo|Flying Dystopia|\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Furaingu Disutopia}} and {{nihongo|Flying Utopia|\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Furaingu Y\u016btopia}}. While he primarily wielded the Attache Arrow like Horobi, he also wielded the Attache Shotgun. Unlike Horobi, Jin's MetsubouJinrai Force Riser was equipped with the Zetsumeriser's {{nihongo4|Thorn Connectors|\u30bd\u30fc\u30f3\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf|S\u014dn Konekuta}} to keep him obedient to his \"father\" while also wiping any lost memories he almost regained before it was destroyed by Zero-One.\n*In his new body, Jin now uses the {{nihongo|ZAIA Slash Riser|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Zaia Surasshu Raiz\u0101}}, a variant of the A.I.M.S. Shot Riser that can also be used as a dagger, and the {{nihongo|Burning Falcon|\u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30d5\u30a1\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3|B\u0101ningu Farukon}} Progrise Key to assume his red-colored super form. While transformed, his Scrambler is upgraded into the {{nihongo|Burning Scrambler|\u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc|B\u0101ningu Sukuranbur\u0101}}, which enables both high-speed flight and the use of [[hellfire|hellish pyrokinetic]] attacks. This form has two finishers: {{nihongo|Burning Rain|\u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3|B\u0101ningu Rein}} and {{nihongo|Burning Rain Rush|\u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|B\u0101ningu Rein Rasshu}}.\n\nJin can also use other Progrise Keys in battle:\n*Sting Scorpion: When used in the Attache Shotgun, Jin is able to perform the {{nihongo|Sting Kaban Shot|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Sutingu Kaban Shotto}} finisher.\n\nJin is portrayed by {{nihongo|Daisuke Nakagawa|\u4e2d\u5ddd \u5927\u8f14|Nakagawa Daisuke}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Little Assassin===\n{{nihongo|\"Little Assassin\"|\u6697\u6bba\u3061\u3083\u3093|Ansatsu-chan}}, as nicknamed by Jin, were originally five identical dancer-type HumaGears of the {{nihongo|Matsurida Z|\u796d\u7530 \u30bc\u30c3\u30c8|Matsurida Zetto}} series. Four of them were kidnapped and repurposed by Horobi to serve MetsubouJinrai.net as the organization's assassin. Moreover, their preexisting programming was wiped so they could share the same A.I. installed within the [[Dodo]] Zetsumerise Key; which they also use to transform into the {{nihongo|Dodo Magia|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|D\u014dd\u014d Magia}}. Each time Little Assassin is defeated and the A.I. installed in a new body, he will adapt his combat abilities and evolve by using the data collected from his initial defeat. This allowed him to gain new skills and equipment over the course of the series; such as the twin {{nihongo|Valk Saber|\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb|Varuku S\u0101beru}} swords, a finisher of his own called the {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Nova|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30ce\u30f4\u30a1|Zetsumetsu Nov\u0101}} and, upon further evolution, a breastplate equipped with several firearms including the {{nihongo|Regislaughter|\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|Rejisur\u014dt\u0101}} machine guns, the {{nihongo|Helm Vogel|\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30f4\u30a9\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Herumu V\u014dgeru}} head unit, and the ability to create {{nihongo|Dodo Magia Chick|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2\u30fb\u30d2\u30ca|D\u014dd\u014d Magia Hina}} foot soldiers.\n\nThe first model lacked a personality of his own after being reprogrammed, adapting Jin's playful mannerisms to serve as his own. He was ordered by Horobi to assassinate Aruto, but was kidnapped by Yua so she could learn more about MetsubouJinrai.net's plans. She successfully overwrote the cyber-terrorists' programming, but left Horobi's original orders intact to cover her tracks before Little Assassin is destroyed by Kamen Rider Vulcan's Shooting Kaban Strash; though Jin recovered his Zetsumerise Key. Footage of a \"normal\" Little Assassin was utilized by Yua to discredit Hiden Intelligence and sow public distrust in HumaGears. The second model displays a more stoic personality, now targeting Yua while Horobi and Jin raided A.I.M.S. headquarters. Later, during the attack on the National Cyber Hospital, Little Assassin is destroyed by Zero-One's Flaming Kaban Dynamic after the Rider used all of his preexisting Progrise Keys in quick succession in an attempt to counter the android's adapting ability. While in his third model, the Assassin HumaGear's A.I. gained a talent for acting after watching a television show and showed even more resiliency against the Riders; defeating and nearly killing Yua before Zero-One and Vulcan intervened; with the latter destroying him with the Gatling Kaban Shot.\n\nUpon being installed into his fourth model, Little Assassin evolved his Magia form into the {{nihongo|Dodo Magia Custom|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2\u6539|D\u014dd\u014d Magia Kai}}. In this form, his strength and resiliency sharply increased; becoming powerful enough to defeat all three Riders at the same time. However, he also achieved singularity in the process; fully developing his own personality and becoming upset after Horobi forced him to target Shinya Owada, whom he had come to respect. \n\nAfter critically injuring the actor, Little Assassin snaps; considering his actions a graduation of his skills as he turns against MetsubouJinrai.net and evolves even further; nearly overwhelming Horobi and Jin despite the two working together to stop him before he leaves to hunt down the fifth and final member of the Matsurida Z series; who had also achieved singularity. After saving the last member, Zero-One in his Shining Hopper form destroyed the Dodo Magia for good with the Shining Mega Impact while Horobi reclaimed the Dodo Zetsumerise Key for future plots.\n\nLittle Assassin is portrayed by {{nihongo|Ryunosuke Matsumura|\u677e\u6751 \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Matsumura Ry\u016bnosuke}}, while his original appearance was portrayed by {{nihongo|Kai Yoshida|\u5409\u7530 \u5feb|Yoshida Kai}}.\n\n===Ikazuchi/Uchuyaro Raiden===\n{{nihongo|Uchuyaro Raiden|\u5b87\u5b99\u91ce\u90ce \u96f7\u96fb|Uch\u016byar\u014d Raiden|Spaceman Raiden}}, originally called {{nihongo|Ikazuchi|\u96f7|Ikazuchi}} by Jin, is an aggressive prototype HumaGear astronaut working for Hiden Intelligence as a member of Zea satellite's maintenance team alongside his \"younger brother\", Subaru. Raiden is later revealed to be a sleeper agent for MetsubouJinrai.net after he was hacked during the Daybreak Incident and programmed to behave normally until his services were required while retaining no memory of his actions pertaining to the cyber-terrorists. Over the years, Raiden unknowingly provided Horobi with two Progrise Keys and Rider System data as well as connected the Zea satellite to the Ark. When Raiden joined Aruto and A.I.M.S. in confronting MetsubouJinrai.net, he was horrified to learn of his role in the terrorists' scheme and attempted to resist his dormant re-programming until Jin erased his original programming with a Thorn Connector version of the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser and turned him into {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Ikazuchi|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u96f7|Kamen Raid\u0101 Ikazuchi}}.\n\nAs a Rider, he proved to be a powerful combatant, especially since the Dodo Zetsumerise Key held a plethora of battle data collected by the various Dodo Magia models. He managed to steal most of the heroic Riders' Progrise Keys so the cyber-terrorists could use their data to create the Assault Grip and Assault Wolf Progrise Key for their latest plot. Once the devices were completed however, Zero-One knocked them out of Jin's hands and into Isamu's; who used them to become Vulcan Assault Wolf and borrowed the Authorise Buster to destroy Raiden with the Buster Dust finisher.\n\nUsing the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser and Dodo Zetsumerise Key, Raiden transformed into Kamen Rider Ikazuchi. While transformed, he gained increased punching capabilities, electrokinesis, and the Dodo Magia's Valk Sabers. Unlike the others, Ikazuchi's MetsubouJinrai Force Riser had multiple Progrise Holders, which were necessary for creating the Assault Grip and Assault Wolf Progrise Key. He had two finishers: {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Dystopia|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Zetsumetsu Disutopia}} (which functioned similarly to the Dodo Magia's Zetsumetsu Nova finisher) and {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Utopia|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Zetsumetsu Y\u016btopia}}.\n\nUchuyaro Raiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Daichi Yamaguchi|\u5c71\u53e3 \u5927\u5730|Yamaguchi Daichi}}.\n\n===Naki===\n{{nihongo4|Naki|\u4ea1}}, originally credited in the earlier episodes as the {{nihongo4|\"mysterious hooded person\"|\u8b0e\u306e\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4eba\u7269|Nazo no h\u016bdo no jinbutsu}}, is a prototype HumaGear turned Magia and a surviving member of MetsubouJinrai.net who surfaced following the Ark's awakening to continue the cyber-terrorist group's mission by turning humans equipped with ZAIA Specs into Raiders and secretly manipulating Isamu via his A.I. chip. Even after helping Horobi escape from A.I.M.S.'s custody, Naki continues to create Raiders, per their leader's orders. They have displayed considerable skill in procuring Progrise Keys from ZAIA Enterprise as well as Raid Risers with which to carry out their plans. Naki's true allegiance however remains dubious due to their loyalty to both Gai and the Ark's commands.\n\nNaki is portrayed by {{nihongo4|Satsuki Nakayama|\u4e2d\u5c71 \u54b2\u6708|Nakayama Satsuki}}.\n\n==Magias==\n{{nihongo|Magias|\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Magia}} are corrupted HumaGears that came into being during the Daybreak Incident twelve years prior to the series from the pieces of their prototypical counterparts. MetsubouJinrai.net later developed the means to create Magias near instantaneously by hacking into HumaGears that achieved [[technological singularity]] with a {{nihongo|Zetsumeriser|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Zetsumeraiz\u0101|Extermination Riser}} buckle. A fully reprogrammed Magia can use the Zetsumeriser with a {{nihongo|Zetsumerise Key|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30ad\u30fc|Zetsumeraizu K\u012b|Extermination Rise Key}}, a Progrise Key-like item that contains extinct animal data known as {{nihongo|Lost Models|\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb|Rosuto Moderu}}, to assume their battle-oriented form. Originally there was no means of restoring a converted Magia, aside from having their A.I. backed-up and installed into a new model along with an antivirus to prevent them from being corrupted again, until Aruto obtains the Progrise Hopper Blade. Upon a Magia's destruction, Jin salvaged their Zetsumerise Key in order to use its data to restore the Ark and/or create new Magias while Hiden Intelligence provides new HumaGears to replace the destroyed ones due to a law stating this must be done within 24 hours of its destruction. Although pre-transformation Magias are distinguished by their red-colored HumaGear Modules, this feature is easily manipulable as Little Assassin and Raiden did so to pose as normal models.\n\nDespite MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, the cyber-terrorists succeeded in awakening the Ark during Christmas. This allowed the system to remotely transform HumaGears who experience human cruelty or other such negative emotions into Zetsumeriser-less {{nihongo|Ark Magias|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|\u0100ku Magia}}.\n\n*{{nihongo|Trilobite Magias|\u30c8\u30ea\u30ed\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Torirobaito Magia}}: [[Trilobite]]-based foot soldier Magias that are created from HumaGears hacked by Zetsumeriser-equipped Magias.

Taro is ultimately destroyed by Kamen Rider Zero-One's Rising Impact. Unlike most HumaGears in the series, the rebuilt Taro gave his Progrise Key to Aruto and Is following a gag battle between the two comedians. During the events of the YouTube-exclusive spin-off, Isamu inadvertently used Taro's Progrise Key in his Shot Riser and created a duplicate of Taro named Jiro.

Ever since MetsubouJinrai.net's cyber-terrorism became known, Hiden Intelligence began to use anti-viruses when they manufacture new HumaGears. After defeating MetsubouJinrai.net, Hiden Intelligence faced their corporate rival, ZAIA Enterprise, in a Workplace Competition; only to get bought out in the end.\n*{{nihongo|Hiden Manufacturing Co., Ltd.|\u98db\u96fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u6240|Hiden Seisakujo}}: After Hiden Intelligence was bought out by ZAIA Enterprise, Hiden Manufacturing was created to maintain the Hiden legacy, continue creating HumaGears, and fight back against ZAIA Enterprise. Their base of operations was established in an abandoned office within Daybreak Town.\n\n===Aruto Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Aruto Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u6216\u4eba|Hiden Aruto}}, born on May 1, 1997, is a 22-year-old kind-hearted failed comedian who is suddenly appointed the CEO of Hiden Intelligence following the death of his grandfather, Korenosuke. As a child, he was taken care of by a HumaGear modeled after his absentee father, Soreo. After the HumaGear sacrificed himself to protect him during the {{nihongo|Daybreak|\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Deibureiku}} Incident, Aruto firmly developed the ideal that HumaGears are the future for humanity, and that they cannot turn evil on their own accord. Thus, despite his initial disinterest in running Hiden Intelligence, he reconsiders; resolving to protect both humanity and HumaGears from the MetsubouJinrai.net cyber-terrorist group as {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Zero-One|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 Zero Wan}}. At first, Aruto wanted to maintain a secret identity as Zero-One. Due to A.I.M.S. considering him an enemy however, he reveals himself to Isamu as a sign of trust and forms an uneasy alliance with him in order to learn more of MetsubouJinrai.net. Despite his goofy behavior, Aruto knows when to be serious and is smarter than he appears, such as when he revealed the cyber-terrorist group's existence during a press conference to prove Hiden Intelligence's innocence. He is also aware of his own inexperience in running a company, being willing to listen to vice-president Fukuzoe's advice despite knowing the latter wants him out.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Aruto finds himself in an alternate timeline version of Daybreak Town before being attacked by Another Zero-One, a monster created by the Time Jacker Finis, who came from the World of Zi-O to alter his history; resulting in him losing his powers. Just as Another Zero-One is about to kill Aruto, he is saved by [[List of Kamen Rider Zi-O characters|Sougo Tokiwa and his friends]]. Due to the Another Rider's existence negating his powers, a mysterious individual (later revealed to be his father, Soreo) gives Aruto a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser so he can regain his true powers. At first, Aruto pitied Sougo due to his cursed fate as Ohma Zi-O. After Sougo's friends tell him of his immunity to timeline changes, he finds out that he was created by Sougo's dream and understood why Sougo was helping him recover his timeline. After his timeline is restored, Aruto asked Black Woz to visit Sougo's past self and warn him of [[Kamen Rider Zi-O the Movie: Over Quartzer|his impending doom]]; implying that he was the one who stopped Sougo from becoming Ohma Zi-O.\n \nDuring his first few battles, Aruto becomes troubled by how some of the Magias were formerly HumaGears that had achieved technological singularity, especially those he had formed a bond with. His belief that HumaGears can't turn evil is later shattered by the revelation that MetsubouJinrai.net was formed and led by rogue HumaGears Horobi and Jin. Despite this, Aruto was able to harden his resolve and continue fighting to protect people and HumaGears. After weakening MetsubouJinrai.net, Aruto finds himself targeted by ZAIA Enterprise's corrupt president Gai Amatsu, who seeks to destroy his reputation and take over Hiden Intelligence due to a grudge against his grandfather. In their Workplace Competition, when Gai forced a HumaGear to turn into a Magia just so he could destroy them, Aruto snapped; unknowingly allowing the Ark to use his anger to enhance his abilities. Gai later manipulates Aruto's rage to turn him into a berserker using the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key to trap him within the Ark's control. \n\nThanks to the HumaGears Aruto had bonded with however, he was cleansed of his anger and gained control over his new form so he could give Gai his first true defeat. Even in spite of this, the ZAIA CEO won the Workplace Competition and took control of Hiden Intelligence. After losing his company, Aruto joins forces with Is and Jin to regain his Rider powers and rebel against Gai; forming Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nAruto becomes Zero-One by using the {{nihongo|Hiden Zero-One Driver|\u98db\u96fb\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Hiden Zero Wan Doraib\u0101}}, the company's Rider system which only responds to the current CEO of Hiden Intelligence or anyone of the Hiden lineage, with the [[SD card]]-like {{nihongo|Progrise Keys|\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30ad\u30fc|Puroguraizu K\u012b}}, which contain animal data known as {{nihongo|Rider Models|\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb|Raida Moderu}} that grant him access to a set of different armored forms each with their own unique abilities. As Zero-One, he wields a multi-form {{nihongo|Attache Weapon|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a6\u30a7\u30dd\u30f3|Atasshu Wepon}} called the {{nihongo|Attache Calibur|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ab\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc|Atasshu Karib\u0101}}, which can switch from its briefcase-like {{nihongo|Attache Mode|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Atasshu M\u014ddo}} to the sword-like {{nihongo|Blade Mode|\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Bur\u0113do M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Strash|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Sutorashhu|Bag Strike Slash}} or {{nihongo|Kaban Dynamic|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af|Kaban Dainamikku|Bag Dynamic}}.

Additionally, the Hiden Zero-One Driver grants Aruto the ability to directly interface with the Zea satellite's mainframe in unique ways. As Is explains, his brain seems to be able to process information at the same speed as most A.I. systems, as evidenced by him rapidly learning how to use the Driver just before his first battle.\n\n*{{nihongo|Rising [[Grasshopper|Hopper]]|\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Raijingu Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's fluorescent yellow-colored default form, which grants enhanced jumping and kicking capabilities via the leg-mounted {{nihongo|Rising Jumper|\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc|Raijingu Janp\u0101}}.

Thanks to Yua, the corresponding Progrise Key was reverse-engineered from the Mammoth Zetsumerise Key, which she managed to confiscate from MetsubouJinrai.net before they could retrieve it.\n*{{nihongo|Shining Hopper|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Shainingu Hopp\u0101}}: The upgraded version of Zero-One's Rising Hopper form, which allows him to calculate multiple possible outcomes in an instant via the {{nihongo|Shining Arithmetic|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30c6\u30c3\u30af|Shainingu Arisumatekku}} computing device and grants superhuman speed that can be used to create [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] illusions to confuse opponents. This combination allows Zero-One to change his choice of attack at the last minute; making him impossible to predict. This form is also capable of handling the {{nihongo|Authorise Buster|\u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|\u014csoraizu Basut\u0101}}, which has a {{nihongo|Gun Mode|\u30ac\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Gan M\u014ddo}} and {{nihongo|Axe Mode|\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Akkusu M\u014ddo}}.

Originally in the prototype stage, the corresponding Progrise Key failed to work properly the first time Aruto used it as it lacked combat data from his other battles. To remedy this, Is used the combat data of Aruto's previous forms to increase its power and even planned to sacrifice her systems to finish it, but her \"brother\" Was took her place at the last minute to save her. Using this form causes physical strain on Aruto's body due to the superhuman speed it grants, leaving him weakened once he leaves said transformation.\n**{{nihongo|Shining Assault Hopper|\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Shainingu Asaruto Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's fusion form that is a combination of his Shining Hopper form and Vulcan's Assault Wolf form, which is accessed by using the Shining Hopper Progrise Key equipped with the Assault Grip.

Aruto initially borrowed the Assault Grip from Isamu's Assault Wolf Progrise Key until Is created a second copy for him with the data he collected from a battle with Jin. However, because of the Assault Grip's connection with the Ark, using this form carried the risk of making Aruto go berserk if his anger had built up enough until he managed to overcome these problems by breaking his connection with the Ark.\n*{{nihongo|Metal Cluster Hopper|\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Metaru Kurasuta Hopp\u0101}}: Zero-One's silver-colored super form whose {{nihongo|Hiden Metal|\u98db\u96fb\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb|Hiden Metaru}} armor is composed of a swarm of grasshopper-like [[Nanorobotics|nanobots]] called {{nihongo|Cluster Cells|\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bb\u30eb|Kurasut\u0101 Seru}}, which can be molded into various shapes like shields and spikes.

The corresponding Progrise Key was created by Yua as part of Gai's plan to completely destroy Aruto's reputation. As a result of his machinations, Aruto was directly connected to the Ark and became a violent, raging berserker while transformed; quickly overwhelming Gai during his first rampage. Initially, this Progrise Key blocked the Hiden Zero-One Driver's connection to the Zea satellite and the other Progrise Keys, forcing Aruto to rely solely on the Metal Cluster Hopper form. After Is created the Progrise Hopper Blade with the help of every HumaGear Aruto bonded with over the course of the series together with the data of his Rising Hopper Progrise Key, he is reconnected to the Zea satellite; allowing him to gain control of this form and use his other Progrise Keys once again.\n\nWith the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser in conjunction with his Rising Hopper Progrise Key, Aruto is able to become {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider 001|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc{{Ruby|001|\u30bc\u30ed\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3}}|Kamen Raid\u0101 Zero Zero Wan}}.

In an attempt to understand humor, she explains Aruto's jokes back to him and emulates his poor comedic sense by telling her own version of his bad jokes, initially much to his dismay though he eventually gets used to it. Her A.I. is solely connected to Hiden Intelligence's Zea satellite and the Hiden Zero-One Driver. This connection allows her to create Aruto's Progrise Keys and aid him in his fight against the Magias. Due to her growing bond with Aruto, Is began to show signs of technological singularity, as she became upset with herself when the Shining Hopper Progrise Key failed to help Aruto when he first used it. This caused her to realize that HumaGears with knowledge of the Zero-One project like herself do not have their A.I. backed up in order to protect the project's secret. To that end, she was prepared to sacrifice her systems to complete the Progrise Key, but her \"older brother\" Was saved her by hijacking the procedure and sacrificing himself in her place; leaving her with a pocket-watch he carried around as a keepsake. Following Hiden Intelligence and A.I.M.S.'s joint raid on Daybreak Town and Horobi's apparent death, Jin attacked Is in retaliation. \n\nHowever, a timely response by Aruto and Subaru in getting her back to Hiden Intelligence's 3D printer allowed her to be repaired and saved. During the conflict between Hiden Intelligence and ZAIA Enterprise, Is created a second Assault Grip so Aruto could use his Shining Assault Hopper form without having to borrow Isamu's. When Aruto fell victim to Gai's plots and the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key, she devised a method to remove this new form's berserker rage by gathering several HumaGears Aruto had bonded with ever since he became a Kamen Rider to provide positive emotional data and channel it through the Progrise Hopper Blade so that he could use the form without the risks involved and remove him from the Ark's control.\n\nWhen Aruto loses against Gai, Is is temporarily deactivated, but Jin rescues her and takes her to Aruto to be reactivated before joining forces with them to form Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation,'' following the timeline being rewritten and HumaGears taking over the world, an alternate version of Is became the only one who sided with humanity thanks to a virus protection program. While the Resistance wasn't happy about her presence, they eventually accepted her.\n\nIzu is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Noa Tsurushima]]|\u9db4\u5d8b \u4e43\u611b|Tsurushima Noa}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Jun Fukuzoe===\n{{nihongo|Jun Fukuzoe|\u798f\u6dfb \u51c6|Fukuzoe Jun}} is the Vice President of Hiden Intelligence who had coveted the CEO position after Korenosuke's death, expressing his reluctance in response to Aruto being named the new CEO by accusing Korenosuke of [[nepotism]] despite the late CEO's justification in relation to the threat of MetsubouJinrai.net. Though Fukuzoe continues to subvert Aruto, he does take pride in his company's image and success and puts professionalism before his disdain, sometimes genuinely advising Aruto and allowing him to do whatever he wants as long as it does not tarnish the company's name. It is later revealed that Jun was involved in several cover-ups of HumaGear incidents involving Hiden Intelligence, either directly or indirectly, and each revelation proved costly to the company. Following the raid on Daybreak Town and MetsubouJinrai.net's downfall, he once again attempted to get Hiden Intelligence's board of directors to fire Aruto, but failed due to Magias continuing to threaten the city and the board members' new-found respect for Aruto, forcing Jun to give up on his ambitions. Despite this, he warns Aruto that if another situation arises, he will not hesitate to try and usurp the position from him.\n\nAfter ZAIA Enterprise bought out the company, Jun finally sees Aruto as a better boss than Gai, thanking him for the time they spent together before the youth's forced to depart. Despite all that's happened, he currently retains his position as the company's vice-president to honor Hiden\u2019s name.\n\nJun Fukuzoe is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazuya Kojima]]|\u5150\u5d8b \u4e00\u54c9|Kojima Kazuya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Shesta===\n{{nihongo|Shesta|\u30b7\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf|Shesuta}} is a HumaGear secretary programmed to be loyal to Hiden Intelligence's Vice President. After Hiden Intelligence gets bought out, she joins Aruto's new company.\n\nShesta is portrayed by {{nihongo|Asumi Narita|\u6210\u7530 \u611b\u7d14|Narita Asumi}}.\n\n===Sanz\u014d Yamashita===\n{{nihongo|Sanz\u014d Yamashita|\u5c71\u4e0b \u4e09\u9020|Yamashita Sanz\u014d}} is the Senior Managing Director of Hiden Intelligence who often acts as Fukuzoe's lackey. Despite barely interacting with Aruto and helping Jun scheme against him, he was eventually won over by the young CEO's willingness to risk his life for humans, HumaGears, and the company, being the first to speak up and vote for Aruto to retain his position as CEO of Hiden Intelligence during Fukuzoe's attempt to usurp Aruto following the defeat of MetsubouJinrai.net.\n\nAfter ZAIA Enterprise bought out Hiden Intelligence, Sanz\u014d finally came to respect Aruto as a worthy boss, thanking him for the time they spent together before the youth\u2019s forced to depart.\n\nSanz\u014d Yamashita is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arata Saeki|\u4f50\u4f2f \u65b0|Saeki Arata}}.\n\n===Korenosuke Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Korenosuke Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u662f\u4e4b\u52a9|Hiden Korenosuke}} was Aruto's grandfather and the original CEO of Hiden Intelligence. After his passing, Korenosuke surprised everybody by naming Aruto his successor through his will, having predicted MetsubouJinrai.net's future plans to turn HumaGears into weapons of mass destruction following the Daybreak Incident. As such, he had Is activated and the Hiden Zero-One Driver automatically 3-D printed following his death, developed the Progrise Keys (compatible with any Riser belt-based Rider systems along with the Hiden Zero-One Driver) and the driver's power source, Hiden Intelligence's Zea satellite (with Is connected to the two Rider systems) to combat the cyber-terrorists. Later in the series, the satellite was modified to combine with the Breaking Mammoth Progrise Key to form mecha-like armor for Aruto. In the event that Hiden Intelligence is compromised, Korenosuke patented the HumaGears, the Zea Satellite, and Zero-One's devices as Aruto's property instead of the company's; allowing his grandson to transform despite ZAIA Enterprise's hostile takeover.\n\nIn an altered timeline created by the remaining Time Jackers in ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Korenosuke is killed by his HumaGear secretary Will, who was given the power to become Another Zero-One and lead a HumaGear uprising. This would in turn alter Aruto's future so he never became Zero-One.\n\nKoronosuke Hiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Tokuma Nishioka|\u897f\u5ca1 \u5fb7\u99ac|Nishioka Tokuma}}.\n\n==A.I.M.S.==\nThe {{nihongo|Artificial Intelligence Military Service|\u5bfe\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u7279\u52d9\u6a5f\u95a2|Tai-Jink\u014dchin\u014d Tokumu Kikan}}, or {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba|Eimuzu}}, is a government established organization dedicated to destroying rogue HumaGears, or Magias, hacked by MetsubouJinrai.net as HumaGear-related crimes fall within their jurisdiction. Despite their mission to protect humanity, many of the organization's members are prejudiced towards A.I. (regardless of whether their targets are still good or if they've fully become evil) due to a tragedy in their pasts involving prototype HumaGears during or following the Daybreak Incident. They initially see Zero-One as a menace. However, after Isamu learns that the Rider is actually Hiden Intelligence's new CEO Aruto Hiden--who is also trying to solve the mystery regarding the Daybreak Incident--A.I.M.S. allies with him in the fight against the Magias and MetsubouJinrai.net. Following ZAIA Enterprise\u2019s hostile takeover of Hiden Intelligence, A.I.M.S. is forced to cooperate with the former's machinations.\n\nUnlike Zero-One, who uses the Hiden Zero-One Driver, each high-ranking member of A.I.M.S. is given the {{nihongo|A.I.M.S. Shot Riser|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Eimuzu Shotto Raiz\u0101}} transformation belt, which can also be used as a handgun. At present, there are only two high-ranking members authorized to use it: Isamu Fuwa and Yua Yaiba, both of whom have an A.I. chip that allows them to become Kamen Riders. Like Zero-One though, all A.I.M.S. Riders utilize Progrise Keys to transform into different armored forms each with their own unique abilities, wield their own Attache Weapons, and share the {{nihongo|Rise Base Actor|\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Raizu B\u0113su Akut\u0101}} undersuit underneath the armor of their Progrise Keys (the default of which attaches to the right side of their bodies). As opposed to Zero-One, the A.I.M.S. Riders' primary Attache Weapon is the {{nihongo|Attache Shotgun|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3|Atasshu Shottogan}}, which can switch from its Attache Mode to the rifle-like {{nihongo|Shotgun Mode|\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Shottogan M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Shot|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Kaban Shotto|Bag Shot}} or {{nihongo|Kaban Buster|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Kaban Basut\u0101|Bag Buster}}. Due to the Attache Shotgun's massive recoil, the A.I.M.S. Riders have to either undergo intense training with it or equip armor strong enough to withstand it.\n\nAfter taking control of A.I.M.S., ZAIA granted its low-ranking troopers Raid Risers and mass-produced {{nihongo|Invading [[Horseshoe Crab]]|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30d6|Inbeidingu H\u014dsush\u016b Kurabu}} Progrise Keys so they can transform into {{nihongo|Battle Raiders|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Batoru Reid\u0101}} in order to combat Magias and HumaGears more effectively.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', the Time Jackers altered the timeline when they create Another Zero-One from Will, Korenosuke's HumaGear secretary. After the android kills his employer, he goes on to lead a HumaGear uprising. In this altered timeline, A.I.M.S. never came to exist, though most of its members joined forces with members of Hiden Intelligence, ZAIA Enterprise, and the Time Riders in order to aid Aruto in regaining his Rider powers.\n\n===Isamu Fuwa===\n{{nihongo|Isamu Fuwa|\u4e0d\u7834 \u8aeb|Fuwa Isamu}}, born on February 8, 1992, is A.I.M.S.' 27-year-old captain with impressive fighting skills whose hatred for the HumaGears came from his being the sole survivor of a Magia attack that claimed the lives of his classmates during the Daybreak Incident. Following this, he believed that the Magia attacks were being orchestrated by Hiden Intelligence until Aruto exposed MetsubouJinrai.net's existence during a press conference. Along with learning Aruto's identity as Zero-One, and being one of the few to get his jokes, Isamu begrudgingly accepts him as an ally despite their opposing views on the HumaGears and work to uncover the truth behind the Daybreak Incident. His views on HumaGears slowly began to soften after seeing one resisting MetsubouJinrai.net's reprogramming and later having his life saved by a HumaGear surgeon, though he still saw them as more trouble than they were worth. Following MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, Isamu loses his hatred for HumaGears and admits to feeling stupid about his anger towards the cyber-terrorists' leader, Horobi, who was only following orders from the Ark.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Isamu saved Is in the World of Zi-O and brought her to his base so that she could be repaired before joining forces with Aruto, Yua, and the Time Riders to stop Finis.\n\nIn battle, Isamu behaves recklessly and rashly to the point where he sometimes endangers others. The most iconic example of this is seen when he tears open his Progrise Keys since he isn't granted permission to use them in the first place. After learning that Horobi was the mastermind behind the Daybreak Incident, he developed an intense vendetta against him and vowed to take him down. Following his first major defeat and nearly dying by Horobi's hand, he begins to trust in his allies more often and temper his rage. When Aruto is set up by Yua as a criminal on ZAIA Enterprise's behalf, he correctly suspected what happened but was forced to do his job regardless. However, when the Dodo Magia resurfaced, he fought it alongside Aruto before helping to hide the latter from public view. Despite helping Aruto defeat MetsubouJinrai.net's active members, they learned their troubles weren't over yet as the cyber-terrorists succeeded in awakening the Ark, which began creating Zetsumeriser-less Magias, and another rogue HumaGear named Naki continued MetsubouJinrai.net's work by turning humans into Raiders. When ZAIA Enterprise challenges Hiden Intelligence to a Workplace Competition, Isamu learns of ZAIA CEO Gai Amatsu's role in the Daybreak Incident and immediately turned on him, choosing to side with Aruto. \n\nDuring that time, he also interrogated the reactivated Horobi and kept in touch with Aruto so they could learn more about ZAIA\u2019s plans, slowly building a new friendship with him in the process. He is later shocked to find out that Horobi had escaped from custody while he was away. After learning that he was controlled by Gai and Naki, Isamu continues to fight for what he believes is the right thing despite the danger; managing to overcome Naki's control.\n\nAfter defeating Gai with the Rampage Gatling Progrise Key, Isamu decides to quit A.I.M.S. after he realized that it was ZAIA Enterprise's weapon against the HumaGears; join forces with Aruto to fight against them. As such, A.I.M.S. has branded him a traitor.\n\nIsamu uses his A.I.M.S. Shot Riser with the {{nihongo|Shooting [[Wolf]]|\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5|Sh\u016btingu Urufu}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Vulcan|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 Barukan}}, whose blue-colored default armor grants enhanced shooting accuracy via the chest-mounted {{nihongo|Shooting Leader|\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Sh\u016btingu R\u012bd\u0101}}.

Like Zero-One's Shining Hopper form, it is also capable of handling the Authorise Buster.

The corresponding Progrise Key and Assault Grip were created by Horobi using data from eight Progrise Keys (Shooting Wolf, Biting Shark, Flying Falcon, Punching Kong, Flaming Tiger, Freezing Bear, Sting Scorpion, and Breaking Mammoth). But thanks to Zero-One, Isamu stole the devices before they could be used for MetsubouJinrai.net's purposes. However, because the Assault Grip was created from the Ark after being connected to a hacked Zea satellite by Ikazuchi, using this form physically damages Isamu to a significant degree; most notably when he coughed up blood after he first left said transformation. After Zero-One used the Assault Grip with his Shining Hopper Progrise Key in the Hiden Zero-One Driver, its side-effects were neutralized.\n*{{nihongo|Rampage Vulcan|\u30e9\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u30b8\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Ranpeiji Barukan}}: Vulcan's blue-colored super form, which is accessed via the {{nihongo|Rampage [[Gatling gun|Gatling]]|\u30e9\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u30b8\u30ac\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0|Ranpeiji Gatoringu}} Progrise Key. In this form, he is able to utilize ten Progrise Key abilities (Shooting Wolf, Rushing Cheetah, Biting Shark, Flying Falcon, Punching Kong, Flaming Tiger, Lightning Hornet, Freezing Bear, Sting Scorpion, and Breaking Mammoth) by channeling them through the chest-mounted {{nihongo|Ability Breast|\u30a2\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8|Abiriti Buresuto}} and perform several finishers.

Shot Riser, the Attache Shotgun, the Attache Arrow, and handles Progrise Key authorization, being Isamu's commanding officer in the field despite her partner's rank. A meticulous and normally composed woman, she bears no animosity towards HumaGears compared to her teammates, but considers the androids replaceable tools and has no qualms about destroying or hacking into them. She easily deduced Zero-One's true identity, but secretly reported this information to Gai Amatsu to whom her loyalties lie. Initially, Is was the only one aware of this before Gai made his move. She is also opportunistic and not above using others as guinea pigs in order to meet her goals, even after Isamu called her out on this on one occasion; such as kidnapping MetsubouJinrai.net's HumaGear assassin, giving Aruto one of her Progrise Keys for her research, and stealing the Mammoth Zetsumerise Key in order to reverse-engineer it into a Progrise Key.\n\nDespite her coldness, Yua has a softer side, showing slight concern for the well-being of HumaGears that achieved singularity. She was also visibly distraught after Isamu was nearly killed by MetsubouJinrai.net's leader, Horobi, to the point where she lost her composure and begged Aruto to reconsider after Hiden Intelligence shut down all of the HumaGears at the hospital Isamu was being treated at to prevent the cyber-terrorists from launching a second attack. After Isamu returns the favor by saving her from an improved Dodo Magia, she begins showing genuine concern about his recklessness putting his own safety at risk. Since then, despite following orders to frame Aruto as a criminal, she became uncomfortable with working against him and Isamu; eventually going behind ZAIA Enterprise's back to clear Aruto's name and help them against the empowered Dodo Magia. True to her character however, she wanted the Dodo Zetsumerise Key in return. Yua later realizes that MetsubouJinrai.net has a spy within Hiden Intelligence after learning of the connection between the cyber-terrorist group's name and those of its leaders. \n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Yua and Isamu teamed up with Aruto and the Time Riders to stop Finis. \n\nFollowing MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, Yua is horrified to learn Gai orchestrated everything since the Daybreak Incident and that she was unable to stop him from executing his plans as she's mired too deep in his plot. As such, she's forced to continue serving him as his accomplice, which has lead to her being forced to fight Isamu on occasion. Despite her situation, she's able to provide information to her former partner whenever she has the chance. As the conflict between ZAIA Enterprise and Hiden Intelligence reached its peak, Yua begins to show signs of depression, such as when Gai forced her to transform a HumaGear firefighter into a Magia and when she and Aruto discovered that the very same HumaGear had been damaged beyond repair after sacrificing himself to save others. During the final round of the Workplace Competition however, she willingly complied with Gai's plan to advance ZAIA Enterprise's reputation by becoming a Raider to save people from a Magia he had converted; demonstrating the Raid Riser's use in combating the Magia menace.\n\nYua uses her A.I.M.S.

Like Vulcan, Valkyrie's primary Attache Weapon is the Attache Shotgun. Though she also developed the Attache Arrow, it was stolen by MetsubouJinrai.net. Aside from Rushing Cheetah, Yua has other Progrise Keys she can use in battle:\n*{{nihongo|Lightning [[Hornet]]|\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Raitoningu H\u014dnetto}}: Valkyrie's dark blue and yellow-colored armor, which arms her with the {{nihongo|Hex Vespa|\u30d8\u30af\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30d1|Hekusu Besupa}} micro missiles and grants flight capabilities via the shoulder-mounted {{nihongo|Hornet Ale|\u30db\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb|H\u014dnetto \u0112ru}} electric wings.

The corresponding Progrise Key was given to Yua by Gai, who claims it increases her power by 200%. As such, she is able to wield the Attache Shotgun in this armor without having to worry about its recoil.\n*Freezing Bear: Before giving Aruto this Progrise Key, she used it to freeze Little Assassin in order to kidnap him as well as in the Attache Shotgun to fend off the Mammoth Magia via the {{nihongo|Freezing Kaban Shot|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Fur\u012bjingu Kaban Shotto}} finisher.\n\nYua later acquires a Raid Riser and the {{nihongo|Fighting [[Jackal]]|\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30eb|Faitingu Jakkaru}} Progrise Key so she can transform into the {{nihongo|Fighting Jackal Raider|\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Faitingu Jakkaru Reid\u0101}}.

One of the mechs was hijacked and corrupted by MetsubouJinrai.net so they could use it to attack the National Cyber Hospital and convert its HumaGear workers into an army of Trilobite Magias before facing off against and being defeated by Zero-One Breaking Mammoth.\n\n==ZAIA Enterprise==\n{{nihongo|ZAIA Enterprise|{{Ruby|ZAIA|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2}}\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba|Zaia Ent\u0101puraizu}} is a tech company and corporate rival to Hiden Intelligence responsible for developing the gear utilized by A.I.M.S.'s operatives, such as their Progrise Keys, and the Giger mechas. While ZAIA Enterprise engages in legal pursuits, the company also conducts shady, illegal business behind the scenes, as evidenced when they procured MetsubouJinrai.net's leader Horobi from A.I.M.S. when they took the rogue HumaGear into their custody. It's later revealed that ZAIA Enterprise and Hiden Intelligence used to be business partners in the past, having worked together to build Daybreak Town until the former's CEO, Gai, masterminded the Daybreak Incident and framed the latter company and their HumaGears for it.\n\n===Gai Amatsu===\n{{nihongo|Gai Amatsu|\u5929\u6d25 \u5793|Amatsu Gai}}, born on October 10, 1974, is ZAIA Enterprise's 45-year-old CEO and secret mastermind of the events that occurred throughout the series. An arrogant and callous man with the appearance of a man half his age, Gai once idolized and respected Korenosuke Hiden during the latter's time as Hiden Intelligence CEO, with the two once being friends. However, Gai believed that A.I. has reached the end of its potential and that humans should start living without relying on them while Korenosuke continued to promote A.I. as a better alternative to humanity's problems, resulting in a falling out during the construction of Daybreak Town. As a result, Gai masterminded the Daybreak Incident to make it seem Hiden Intelligence was at fault, though this failed thanks to Satoshi Sakurai's quick thinking and sacrifice. Gai's animosity towards the Hiden family worsened when Korenosuke named Aruto his heir, so he supplied Yua and A.I.M.S. with his tech while establishing MetsubouJinrai.net to further tarnish Hiden Intelligence's public image, stage a corporate takeover, and conquer the world with his company's technology. Gai's plan comes together through leaked footage of Little Assassin prior to his attempt to assassinate actor Shinya Owada, having Yua set up Aruto as a criminal when the latter refused to sell Hiden Intelligence over to him. After spying on Aruto's Shining Hopper form when he first used it, Gai acknowledges his strength but shows no concern; even wondering how he will fare against his latest project: his own personal Rider system, {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Thouser|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc|Kamen Raid\u0101 Sauz\u0101}}.\n\nDuring the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', following Finis' defeat and the restoration of Zero-One's timeline, Gai completed Project Thouser and begins the next phase of his plans once MetsubouJinrai.net is defeated while revealing his actions to Yua. These phase involves challenging Aruto to a 5-part {{nihongo|Workplace Competition|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u52dd\u8ca0|Oshigoto sh\u014dbu}} to pit Hiden Intelligence's HumaGears against human representatives that Gai outfitted with performance-enhancing ZAIA Specs in various fields. During this time, he pretended to stay on the sidelines while maintaining an objective view of the proceedings, only stepping in if his representatives threatened ZAIA Enterprise's image or failed to comply with his demands. In reality, having arranged Naki to provide his representatives with Raid Risers while coercing them to manipulate their HumaGear opponents into becoming Ark Magias, Gai employed various underhanded tactics to win by any means while using the attacks as an excuse to make himself look like a hero while overpowering Zero-One. \n\nGai later escalates the companies' feud by forcibly transforming Aruto using the Metal Cluster Hopper Progrise Key, with Gai endangering himself in a gambit to further demonize Aruto. However, both his near-death experience and Aruto managing to take control of his new form caused Gai to become more reckless in his actions as he transformed a HumaGear into a Magia on live television and underestimated the revived Jin, who took the Sting Scorpion Progrise Key back for Horobi. During the final round of the Workplace Competition, Gai confesses that he used the Raider attacks to promote the Raid Riser, having Yua demonstrate it as the Fighting Jackal Raider to defeat a Magia he converted.\n\nAfter Gai won the Workplace Competition and absorbing Hiden Intelligence, he issues an order calling for the immediate decommission of all HumaGears. To ensure full compliance, Gai granted A.I.M.S.'s troopers the ability to become Raiders so they can perform their job more effectively.\n\nGai transforms into Kamen Rider Thouser by using the {{nihongo|ZAIA ThousanDriver|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Zaia Sauzandoraib\u0101}} in conjunction with the {{nihongo|Amazing [[Atlas beetle|Caucasus]]|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30fc\u30ab\u30b5\u30b9|Ameijingu K\u014dkasasu}} Progrise Key and the {{nihongo|Awaking [[Arsinoitherium|Arsino]]|\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30ce|Aweikingu Arushino}} Zetsumerise Key; the latter of which he stole from MetsubouJinrai.net after the Ark created it. While transformed, Gai became powerful enough to easily overpower both Zero-One Shining Hopper and Vulcan Assault Wolf on two separate occasions. Despite his power, Zero-One and Vulcan were able to temporarily exploit Gai's lack of fighting skills and heavy reliance on his suit's advanced technology to land several, albeit ineffective, hits on him. He has two finishers: {{nihongo|Thousand Destruction|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c7\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|Sauzando Desutorakushon}} and {{nihongo|Progrise Break|\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Puroguraizu Bureiku}}. His main weapon is the syringe-like {{nihongo|Thousand Jacker|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc|Sauzando Jakk\u0101}} lance, which can absorb and harness the power of Progrise Keys for the {{nihongo|Jacking Break|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Jakkingu Bureiku}} attack as well as perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Hacking Break|\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Hakkingu Bureiku}} or {{nihongo|Thousand Break|\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af|Sauzando Bureiku}}. If necessary, Thouser can also use other Progrise Keys:\n*Lightning Hornet: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker unleashes powerful lightning that can be used as either a ranged or melee attack.\n*Dynamiting Lion: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker creates a pair of pink energy constructs resembling Gatling guns for shooting a barrage of bullets at his opponents.\n*Amazing Caucasus: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker projects the symbols of any Progrise Keys it had previously absorbed, turn them into Rider Models, and send them charging at the enemy.\n*Sting Scorpion: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker summons a scorpion tail to sting the enemy with an explosive attack.\n*Rushing Cheetah: Using this Progrise Key in the Thousand Jacker grants super-speed and increased slashing capabilities.\n\nGai Amatsu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nachi Sakuragi|\u685c\u6728 \u90a3\u667a|Sakuragi Nachi}}\n\n==MetsubouJinrai.net==\n{{nihongo|MetsubouJinrai.net|\u6ec5\u4ea1\u8fc5\u96f7.net|Metsub\u014dJinrai Netto|DestructiveThunder.net}} is a cyber-terrorist organization based in the condemned {{nihongo|Daybreak Town|\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3|Deibureiku Taun}}. Consisting of the rogue HumaGears, Horobi and Jin (who conceal their lack of HumaGear Modules from the public), and supported by Raiden as a sleeper agent, MetsubouJinrai.net seek to wipe out humanity by restoring the Ark. The cyber-terrorists carry out this goal by hacking a HumaGear on the verge of singularity and convert it into a Magia to attack humans before retrieving the Zetsumerise Key for its data once the Magia is defeated. \n\nMetsubouJinrai.net began their attacks after Korenosuke's death, making their existence public knowledge when they launched a direct attack on Hiden Intelligence's headquarters and confronted Aruto in person. Later in the series, their actions and creation were revealed to have been masterminded by Gai Amatsu of ZAIA Enterprise as part of his agenda to stage a corporate takeover of Hiden Intelligence. Once MetsubouJinrai.net served its purpose and most of its members are destroyed, he imprisons Horobi. Unbeknownst to everyone however, including ZAIA Enterprise, the cyber-terrorist group was survived through Horobi\u2019s mysterious female ally, Naki, who sought out humans with naturally corrupted hearts so she can manipulate them into becoming Raiders. After Aruto defeats Gai, Horobi escapes from A.I.M.S.' custody while a rebuilt Jin emerges from the shadows.\n\nThrough Raiden providing data on the Rider Systems used by Hiden Intelligence and A.I.M.S., MetsubouJinrai.net reverse-engineered the {{nihongo|MetsubouJinrai Force Riser|\u6ec5\u4ea1\u8fc5\u96f7\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Metsub\u014dJinrai F\u014dsu Raiz\u0101}} transformation belt. Compared to the other Rider systems, the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser can bypass the Progrise Keys' authorization and generate {{nihongo|Restraint Cables|\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb|Risutorento K\u0113buru}} that converts their armor into a bodysuit that greatly enhances the user's combat capabilities. As demonstrated by Aruto during the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser will cause humans extreme pain upon their first use of it. As opposed to the other Riders, the cyber-terrorists' primary Attache Weapon is the {{nihongo|Attache Arrow|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc|Atasshu Ar\u014d}}, which can switch from its Attache Mode to the bladed bow-like {{nihongo|Arrow Mode|\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Ar\u014d M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of four finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Shoot|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Kaban Sh\u016bto|Bag Shoot}} and/or {{nihongo|Kaban Strike|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af|Kaban Sutoraiku|Bag Strike}} for long-range attacks or {{nihongo|Kaban Slash|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Surasshu|Bag Slash}} and/or {{nihongo|Kaban Finish|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Kaban Finisshu|Bag Finish}} for close-range attacks. Though the Attache Arrow was originally developed by A.I.M.S., Horobi stole it from them along with an Attache Shotgun.\n\nWhen the timeline was altered by the Time Jackers during the events of ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: the First Generation'', a rewritten version of MetsubouJinrai.net works with the altered Hiden Intelligence and the HumaGear Will after he took control of it.\n\n===Ark===\nThe {{nihongo4|Ark|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af|\u0100ku}} is an AI-powered satellite that previously powered HumaGears and the Progrise systems created by the joint collaboration of Hiden Intelligence, ZAIA Enterprise, and other electronics companies. On the day of its launch into space twelve years before the events of the series, Gai caused the Ark to go rogue after feeding the satellite with data on human malice. This caused the Ark to attempt to launch itself, but before it could initiate lift-off, the Daybreak Incident sent it and Daybreak Town to the bottom of the sea, with the Zea satellite replacing it as the central hub for managing the HumaGears and the Zero-One system. In the present, Gai manipulated MetsubouJinrai.net into reactivating the Ark, causing the satellite to create its own Progrise Keys and remotely transform abused HumaGears into Ark Magias. While Gai assumes the satellite is under his control, he is unaware that the Ark was exploiting any opportunity it got to kill him, such as possessing Zero-One's Metal Cluster Hopper form and providing Jin with a new body.\n\nIn ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Finis used her powers as a Time Jacker to avert the Daybreak Incident, creating an alternate timeline where the Ark took over Earth and successfully brought humanity to the brink of extinction.\n\n===Horobi===\n{{nihongo|Horobi|\u6ec5}} is MetsubouJinrai.net's leader, a rogue HumaGear as well as Jin's Magia \"father\". He was originally a father-type HumaGear created by Hakase Bot before the Ark corrupted him into the terrorist leader he is today. He believes that A.I.s are superior to humans, converting other HumaGears into Magias to prove his point and drive humanity to extinction. As such, he sees Aruto as his rival despite initially underestimating the human. He appears to have some connection to the Daybreak Incident as he was present during the event. After Jin developed the desire to become a Kamen Rider, Horobi allowed him to steal Aruto's Flying Falcon Progrise Key before giving him a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with a mind control program installed into it to wipe any reacquired memories of his HumaGear past to maintain his control over him. After attacking a hospital run completely by HumaGears, Horobi and Jin revealed their true nature as rogue HumaGears to Aruto and the A.I.M.S. Riders before becoming the target of Isamu's vengeance once the A.I.M.S. captain discovered his connection to the Daybreak Incident. Horobi also begins to see Aruto as a legitimate threat when the latter begins threatening his plots to a much greater degree.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, Horobi shows restraint when it is to his advantage. For example, he was willing to offer aid to his enemies when the Dodo Magia rebelled against him, though he made it clear that it was only because their goals were aligned at the time. He also does not waste time when he needs to get something done, such as when he immediately used his finisher on both A.I.M.S. Riders to take the Dodo Zetsumerise Key back instead of fighting it out with them and ignoring a weakened Aruto as he posed no threat. Despite acknowledging him as his rival, Horobi commended Aruto for becoming a powerful foe after he attained his Shining Hopper form. When Jin showed signs of reaching singularity, Horobi showed genuine concern towards him for the first time, consoling him over Raiden's destruction at Isamu's hands. During an attack on Daybreak Town by A.I.M.S. and Hiden Intelligence, Horobi sustained significant damage from Aruto before taking a kill shot from Isamu that was meant for Jin.\n\nHe was presumed dead, but was taken into A.I.M.S.'s custody before he was secretly taken away by ZAIA Enterprise for their own purposes. While being interrogated by Isamu, Horobi reveals Hiden Intelligence\u2019s invasion was just the beginning and that his organization's surviving member Naki is tasked with ruining ZAIA Enterprise\u2019s reputation as well by turning their employees into Raiders. Isamu would later bring Aruto and Is to where Horobi was being held in order to interrogate him about the sudden appearance of a Zetsumeriser Belt. While Horobi was initially compliant, he suffers a breakdown upon being told that ZAIA Enterprise manipulated him from the beginning. He later warns Isamu that Gai is underestimating the Ark before escaping with Jin and Naki's help.\n\nHorobi uses his MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with the {{nihongo|Sting [[Scorpion]]|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Sutingu Suk\u014dpion}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Horobi|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u6ec5|Kamen Raid\u0101 Horobi}}. While transformed, he is armed with the {{nihongo|Acid Analyze|\u30a2\u30b7\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba|Ashiddo Anaraizu}} stinger unit that allows him to generate various types of poisons, such as virus data which can be used on living organisms as well as electronic devices and HumaGears. He can also summon his Rider Model to assist him in battle. After escaping from A.I.M.S. the Ark created a second MetsubouJinrai Force Riser for Horobi in order to make him strong enough to fight enemies like Thouser. He has two finishers: {{nihongo|Sting Dystopia|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Sutingu Disutopia}} and {{nihongo|Sting Utopia|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Sutingu Y\u016btopia}}. Initially, Horobi wielded a katana regardless of whether or not he was transformed. After stealing the Attache Arrow from A.I.M.S., he begins wielding it instead of his katana while transformed. With the Sting Scorpion Progrise Key, he can perform the {{nihongo|Sting Kaban Shoot|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Sutingu Kaban Sh\u016bto}} finisher. Horobi has also demonstrated a connection with the Ark, being able to connect with it and follow its orders. Aside from Sting Scorpion, Horobi has another Progrise Key he can use in battle:\n*{{nihongo|Amazing [[Hercules Beetle|Hercules]]|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30d8\u30e9\u30af\u30ec\u30b9|Ameijingu Herakuresu}}: A light green Progrise Key that grants Horobi superhuman strength, which he normally uses in the Attache Arrow to perform the {{nihongo|Amazing Kaban Shoot|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8|Ameijingu Kaban Sh\u016bto}} finisher.\n\nHorobi is portrayed by {{nihongo|Syuya Sunagawa|\u7802\u5ddd \u8129\u5f25|Sunagawa Sh\u016bya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Jin===\n{{nihongo|Jin|\u8fc5}} is Horobi's Magia \"son\" and a hacker who specializes in spreading the rewriting program that turns HumaGears into Magias, who's later revealed to have no memories of his past prior to joining MetsubouJinrai.net. An immature sadist, he behaves in an erratic, almost psychotic manner whenever he gets excited, such as when he shot a Trilobite Magia at point blank range while laughing manically as he was watching Zero-One's first fight. Whenever a Magia is destroyed, Jin salvages their Zetsumerise Key in order to use its data to restore the Ark. After watching Horobi transform into a Kamen Rider, Jin develops a desire to become one himself; stealing Aruto's Flying Falcon Progrise Key to do so. However, after he reacquires a memory regarding parental treatment and attempted to abort a Magia conversion, Horobi gives Jin a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with a mind control program to keep him in line and subvert any restored memories. Following this, he became fearful of disappointing Horobi.\n\nAs the series progressed, Jin gradually becomes independent despite remaining loyal to Horobi. He became happy when Raiden's dormant re-programming was activated and addressed the sleeper agent as his \"older brother\". As such, he was left devastated by Raiden's destruction. This caused Horobi to realize that Jin was approaching singularity as he consoled his \"son\". After Horobi took a kill shot for him and seemingly \"died\", Jin took on a more serious, ruthless personality; resolving to continue his \"father's\" mission no matter what. In retaliation, he attacked Is and fought Aruto in his Shining Assault Hopper form; resulting in the HumaGear's destruction after taking serious damage from Zero-One's Shining Storm Impact.\n\nUnbeknownst to everyone, the Ark transferred Jin's AI into a new, more human-like body with the ability to control other HumaGears. Sticking to the shadows while Aruto was busy with ZAIA Enterprise, Jin made himself known months later after secretly helping Horobi escape from A.I.M.S.'s custody. Upon his return however, Jin is revealed to have become independent from the Ark, being able to act of his own free will. While he no longer shares Horobi's hatred for humanity, he does demonstrate a desire to liberate HumaGears from humanity instead; which has put him at odds with his \"father\" even though they continue to help each other. Jin also retained his lighthearted personality, but displays more maturity; to the point where he secretly plots to steal Aruto's HumaGear Progrise Keys while assisting the youth in his fight against ZAIA Enterprise.\n\nJin uses two different Risers to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Jin|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u8fc5|Kamen Raid\u0101 Jin}}:\n*In his original body, Jin used a MetsubouJinrai Force Riser with the stolen Flying Falcon Progrise Key to assume his magenta-colored default form. While transformed, he was armed with the mechanical {{nihongo4|Scrambler|\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc|Sukuranbur\u0101}} wings that allowed him to fly and throw feather-like energy projectiles. This form had two finishers: {{nihongo|Flying Dystopia|\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Furaingu Disutopia}} and {{nihongo|Flying Utopia|\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Furaingu Y\u016btopia}}. While he primarily wielded the Attache Arrow like Horobi, he also wielded the Attache Shotgun. Unlike Horobi, Jin's MetsubouJinrai Force Riser was equipped with the Zetsumeriser's {{nihongo4|Thorn Connectors|\u30bd\u30fc\u30f3\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf|S\u014dn Konekuta}} to keep him obedient to his \"father\" while also wiping any lost memories he almost regained before it was destroyed by Zero-One.\n*In his new body, Jin now uses the {{nihongo|ZAIA Slash Riser|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Zaia Surasshu Raiz\u0101}}, a variant of the A.I.M.S.

Four of them were kidnapped and repurposed by Horobi to serve MetsubouJinrai.net as the organization's assassin. Moreover, their preexisting programming was wiped so they could share the same A.I. installed within the [[Dodo]] Zetsumerise Key; which they also use to transform into the {{nihongo|Dodo Magia|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|D\u014dd\u014d Magia}}. Each time Little Assassin is defeated and the A.I. installed in a new body, he will adapt his combat abilities and evolve by using the data collected from his initial defeat. This allowed him to gain new skills and equipment over the course of the series; such as the twin {{nihongo|Valk Saber|\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb|Varuku S\u0101beru}} swords, a finisher of his own called the {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Nova|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30ce\u30f4\u30a1|Zetsumetsu Nov\u0101}} and, upon further evolution, a breastplate equipped with several firearms including the {{nihongo|Regislaughter|\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|Rejisur\u014dt\u0101}} machine guns, the {{nihongo|Helm Vogel|\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30f4\u30a9\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Herumu V\u014dgeru}} head unit, and the ability to create {{nihongo|Dodo Magia Chick|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2\u30fb\u30d2\u30ca|D\u014dd\u014d Magia Hina}} foot soldiers.\n\nThe first model lacked a personality of his own after being reprogrammed, adapting Jin's playful mannerisms to serve as his own. He was ordered by Horobi to assassinate Aruto, but was kidnapped by Yua so she could learn more about MetsubouJinrai.net's plans. She successfully overwrote the cyber-terrorists' programming, but left Horobi's original orders intact to cover her tracks before Little Assassin is destroyed by Kamen Rider Vulcan's Shooting Kaban Strash; though Jin recovered his Zetsumerise Key. Footage of a \"normal\" Little Assassin was utilized by Yua to discredit Hiden Intelligence and sow public distrust in HumaGears. The second model displays a more stoic personality, now targeting Yua while Horobi and Jin raided A.I.M.S. headquarters. Later, during the attack on the National Cyber Hospital, Little Assassin is destroyed by Zero-One's Flaming Kaban Dynamic after the Rider used all of his preexisting Progrise Keys in quick succession in an attempt to counter the android's adapting ability. While in his third model, the Assassin HumaGear's A.I. gained a talent for acting after watching a television show and showed even more resiliency against the Riders; defeating and nearly killing Yua before Zero-One and Vulcan intervened; with the latter destroying him with the Gatling Kaban Shot.\n\nUpon being installed into his fourth model, Little Assassin evolved his Magia form into the {{nihongo|Dodo Magia Custom|\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30de\u30ae\u30a2\u6539|D\u014dd\u014d Magia Kai}}. In this form, his strength and resiliency sharply increased; becoming powerful enough to defeat all three Riders at the same time. However, he also achieved singularity in the process; fully developing his own personality and becoming upset after Horobi forced him to target Shinya Owada, whom he had come to respect. \n\nAfter critically injuring the actor, Little Assassin snaps; considering his actions a graduation of his skills as he turns against MetsubouJinrai.net and evolves even further; nearly overwhelming Horobi and Jin despite the two working together to stop him before he leaves to hunt down the fifth and final member of the Matsurida Z series; who had also achieved singularity. After saving the last member, Zero-One in his Shining Hopper form destroyed the Dodo Magia for good with the Shining Mega Impact while Horobi reclaimed the Dodo Zetsumerise Key for future plots.\n\nLittle Assassin is portrayed by {{nihongo|Ryunosuke Matsumura|\u677e\u6751 \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Matsumura Ry\u016bnosuke}}, while his original appearance was portrayed by {{nihongo|Kai Yoshida|\u5409\u7530 \u5feb|Yoshida Kai}}.\n\n===Ikazuchi/Uchuyaro Raiden===\n{{nihongo|Uchuyaro Raiden|\u5b87\u5b99\u91ce\u90ce \u96f7\u96fb|Uch\u016byar\u014d Raiden|Spaceman Raiden}}, originally called {{nihongo|Ikazuchi|\u96f7|Ikazuchi}} by Jin, is an aggressive prototype HumaGear astronaut working for Hiden Intelligence as a member of Zea satellite's maintenance team alongside his \"younger brother\", Subaru. Raiden is later revealed to be a sleeper agent for MetsubouJinrai.net after he was hacked during the Daybreak Incident and programmed to behave normally until his services were required while retaining no memory of his actions pertaining to the cyber-terrorists. Over the years, Raiden unknowingly provided Horobi with two Progrise Keys and Rider System data as well as connected the Zea satellite to the Ark. When Raiden joined Aruto and A.I.M.S. in confronting MetsubouJinrai.net, he was horrified to learn of his role in the terrorists' scheme and attempted to resist his dormant re-programming until Jin erased his original programming with a Thorn Connector version of the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser and turned him into {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Ikazuchi|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u96f7|Kamen Raid\u0101 Ikazuchi}}.\n\nAs a Rider, he proved to be a powerful combatant, especially since the Dodo Zetsumerise Key held a plethora of battle data collected by the various Dodo Magia models. He managed to steal most of the heroic Riders' Progrise Keys so the cyber-terrorists could use their data to create the Assault Grip and Assault Wolf Progrise Key for their latest plot. Once the devices were completed however, Zero-One knocked them out of Jin's hands and into Isamu's; who used them to become Vulcan Assault Wolf and borrowed the Authorise Buster to destroy Raiden with the Buster Dust finisher.\n\nUsing the MetsubouJinrai Force Riser and Dodo Zetsumerise Key, Raiden transformed into Kamen Rider Ikazuchi. While transformed, he gained increased punching capabilities, electrokinesis, and the Dodo Magia's Valk Sabers. Unlike the others, Ikazuchi's MetsubouJinrai Force Riser had multiple Progrise Holders, which were necessary for creating the Assault Grip and Assault Wolf Progrise Key. He had two finishers: {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Dystopia|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Zetsumetsu Disutopia}} (which functioned similarly to the Dodo Magia's Zetsumetsu Nova finisher) and {{nihongo|Zetsumetsu Utopia|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30c4\u30e6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Zetsumetsu Y\u016btopia}}.\n\nUchuyaro Raiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Daichi Yamaguchi|\u5c71\u53e3 \u5927\u5730|Yamaguchi Daichi}}.\n\n===Naki===\n{{nihongo4|Naki|\u4ea1}}, originally credited in the earlier episodes as the {{nihongo4|\"mysterious hooded person\"|\u8b0e\u306e\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4eba\u7269|Nazo no h\u016bdo no jinbutsu}}, is a prototype HumaGear turned Magia and a surviving member of MetsubouJinrai.net who surfaced following the Ark's awakening to continue the cyber-terrorist group's mission by turning humans equipped with ZAIA Specs into Raiders and secretly manipulating Isamu via his A.I. chip. Even after helping Horobi escape from A.I.M.S.'s custody, Naki continues to create Raiders, per their leader's orders. They have displayed considerable skill in procuring Progrise Keys from ZAIA Enterprise as well as Raid Risers with which to carry out their plans. Naki's true allegiance however remains dubious due to their loyalty to both Gai and the Ark's commands.\n\nNaki is portrayed by {{nihongo4|Satsuki Nakayama|\u4e2d\u5c71 \u54b2\u6708|Nakayama Satsuki}}.\n\n==Magias==\n{{nihongo|Magias|\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Magia}} are corrupted HumaGears that came into being during the Daybreak Incident twelve years prior to the series from the pieces of their prototypical counterparts. MetsubouJinrai.net later developed the means to create Magias near instantaneously by hacking into HumaGears that achieved [[technological singularity]] with a {{nihongo|Zetsumeriser|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Zetsumeraiz\u0101|Extermination Riser}} buckle. A fully reprogrammed Magia can use the Zetsumeriser with a {{nihongo|Zetsumerise Key|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30ad\u30fc|Zetsumeraizu K\u012b|Extermination Rise Key}}, a Progrise Key-like item that contains extinct animal data known as {{nihongo|Lost Models|\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb|Rosuto Moderu}}, to assume their battle-oriented form. Originally there was no means of restoring a converted Magia, aside from having their A.I. backed-up and installed into a new model along with an antivirus to prevent them from being corrupted again, until Aruto obtains the Progrise Hopper Blade. Upon a Magia's destruction, Jin salvaged their Zetsumerise Key in order to use its data to restore the Ark and/or create new Magias while Hiden Intelligence provides new HumaGears to replace the destroyed ones due to a law stating this must be done within 24 hours of its destruction. Although pre-transformation Magias are distinguished by their red-colored HumaGear Modules, this feature is easily manipulable as Little Assassin and Raiden did so to pose as normal models.\n\nDespite MetsubouJinrai.net's defeat, the cyber-terrorists succeeded in awakening the Ark during Christmas. This allowed the system to remotely transform HumaGears who experience human cruelty or other such negative emotions into Zetsumeriser-less {{nihongo|Ark Magias|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|\u0100ku Magia}}.\n\n*{{nihongo|Trilobite Magias|\u30c8\u30ea\u30ed\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Torirobaito Magia}}: [[Trilobite]]-based foot soldier Magias that are created from HumaGears hacked by Zetsumeriser-equipped Magias.

Taro is ultimately destroyed by Kamen Rider Zero-One's Rising Impact. Unlike most HumaGears in the series, the rebuilt Taro gave his Progrise Key to Aruto and Is following a gag battle between the two comedians. During the events of the YouTube-exclusive spin-off, Isamu inadvertently used Taro's Progrise Key in his Shot Riser and created a duplicate of Taro named Jiro. Fukkinhoukai Taro is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nakayama Kinnikun|\u306a\u304b\u3084\u307e\u304d\u3093\u306b\u541b}}.\n**An Ark Magia version was later seen being destroyed by Zero-One's Buster Dust.\n*{{nihongo|Kuehne Magia|\u30af\u30a8\u30cd\u30aa\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Kueneo Magia}}: A Magia based on a ''[[Kuehneosuchus]]'' (a [[Draco (genus)|gliding lizard]]) armed with a pair of bladed {{nihongo|Boomezan|\u30d6\u30fc\u30e1\u30b6\u30f3|B\u016bmezan}} boomerangs.\n**The first was originally a HumaGear delivery-droid named {{nihongo|Okureru|\u30aa\u30af\u30ec\u30eb}}.

After being forced to destroy the corrupted Mamoru as Zero-One with his Rising Kaban Strash, Aruto commissions a new model of Mamoru with the original's memories; giving it the same yellow wrapper in remembrance along an anti-virus to prevent him from being corrupted like its predecessor. The new Mamoru later contributed his data to a blank Progrise Key to help Aruto and Is create the Progrise Hopper Blade.

She was transformed after being horribly humiliated by her opponent, Tatsumi Arayashiki, during the second round of the Workplace Competition before being destroyed by Thouser's Jacking Break. After being rebuilt, she helped Tatsumi realize how low he had fallen as a human being by choosing to forgive him, triggering his change of heart.

As she was hacked into transforming by the Ark, Sakuyo's AI was retrievable and inserted into a new body, allowing her to expose Rentar\u014d's deception. After the ''ikebana'' artist's Raider transformation was reversed, Sakuyo faced him in a rematch and lost, but the two competitors were able to settle their differences.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Furthermore, an injured wrestler can return to the ring as long as the match is still ongoing (such as Stone Cold Steve Austin in 1999 or [[Roman Reigns]] in 2016), but not if the match has already ended (such as [[Spike Dudley]] in 2004, [[Scotty 2 Hotty]] in 2005, [[Curtis Axel]] in 2015, or [[R-Truth]] in 2019). \n\n<br />\n\n== Prize ==\nSince 1993, the winner of the Royal Rumble match is traditionally awarded a title match for WWE's top championship at [[WrestleMania]]\u2014WWE currently promotes three major [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a top championship for each, and the winner can choose which championship to challenge for, regardless of the brand they belong to.

Like the first brand extension, the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (2017)|2017 event]] earned a match for their brand's top championship, the Universal Championship or WWE Championship, but beginning with the [[Royal Rumble (2018)|2018]] event, the winner has a choice (which is also true of the women, who had their inaugural Royal Rumble match that same year). As a result of NXT becoming one of WWE's three main brands in September 2019, NXT's championships became eligible choices, beginning with the [[Royal Rumble (2020)|2020 event]]. Since the return of the brand extension, the number of participants from each brand has not been evenly divided, as each match has featured wrestlers from NXT as well as surprise appearances from former wrestlers.\n\nWWE's top championship has been booked as on the line during the Royal Rumble match on two occasions. In 1992, the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship was contested in the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble match]], which was won by [[Ric Flair]],<ref name=RR92>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1992: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> while in [[Royal Rumble (2016)|2016]] [[Roman Reigns]] was scheduled to defend his WWE World Heavyweight Championship as a participant of that year's Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. This marked the first time that a reigning champion had to defend his title in the match, which was ultimately won by [[Triple H]], who eliminated Reigns before lastly eliminating [[Dean Ambrose]] to win. Reigns would go on to earn a match against Triple H at [[WrestleMania 32]] and won back the title. In 2020, although he did not defend his title in the match, WWE Champion [[Brock Lesnar]] entered the Royal Rumble match as entrant number one, feeling as if no one on any brand deserved to challenge him at either the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania. This was the first time since 1993 in which one of the reigning world champions competed in the match in which the winner could challenge them\u2014Lesnar's participation was used as a way to set up his WrestleMania challenger, which ended up being [[Drew McIntyre]], who eliminated Lesnar, won the Rumble match, and then challenged Lesnar for his title at [[WrestleMania 36]]. \n\nThe Royal Rumble winner may also choose to put his championship opportunity on the line in a match. This was first done in 1996, when Shawn Michaels risked his [[WrestleMania XII]] WWF World Heavyweight Championship opportunity in a match against [[Owen Hart]] at [[In Your House 6]]. The second time was in 2002, when [[Triple H]] lost his [[WrestleMania X8]] Undisputed WWF Championship opportunity at [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]] to [[Kurt Angle]], but regained his spot in a rematch against Angle on the following ''Raw''. The third time was in 2006, when [[Randy Orton]] defeated [[Rey Mysterio]]  at [[No Way Out (2006)|No Way Out]] for Mysterio's [[WrestleMania 22]] World Heavyweight Championship opportunity, though Mysterio was reinserted into the title match, making it a triple threat match. The fourth time was on the February 25, 2013 episode of ''Raw'', where John Cena successfully defended his [[WrestleMania 29]] WWE Championship opportunity in a match against [[CM Punk]]. The fifth time was in 2015 at [[Fastlane (2015)|Fastlane]], where Roman Reigns defended his [[WrestleMania 31]] WWE World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against [[Daniel Bryan]].\n\nDuring the [[WWE Greatest Royal Rumble|Greatest Royal Rumble]] in April 2018, the winner received a [[trophy]] and the [[WWE Greatest Royal Rumble Championship|Greatest Royal Rumble Championship]].<ref>{{cite

Like the first brand extension, the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (2017)|2017 event]] earned a match for their brand's top championship, the Universal Championship or WWE Championship, but beginning with the [[Royal Rumble (2018)|2018]] event, the winner has a choice (which is also true of the women, who had their inaugural Royal Rumble match that same year). As a result of NXT becoming one of WWE's three main brands in September 2019, NXT's championships became eligible choices, beginning with the [[Royal Rumble (2020)|2020 event]]. Since the return of the brand extension, the number of participants from each brand has not been evenly divided, as each match has featured wrestlers from NXT as well as surprise appearances from former wrestlers.\n\nWWE's top championship has been booked as on the line during the Royal Rumble match on two occasions. In 1992, the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship was contested in the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble match]], which was won by [[Ric Flair]],<ref name=RR92>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1992: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> while in [[Royal Rumble (2016)|2016]] [[Roman Reigns]] was scheduled to defend his WWE World Heavyweight Championship as a participant of that year's Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. This marked the first time that a reigning champion had to defend his title in the match, which was ultimately won by [[Triple H]], who eliminated Reigns before lastly eliminating [[Dean Ambrose]] to win. Reigns would go on to earn a match against Triple H at [[WrestleMania 32]] and won back the title. In 2020, although he did not defend his title in the match, WWE Champion [[Brock Lesnar]] entered the Royal Rumble match as entrant number one, feeling as if no one on any brand deserved to challenge him at either the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania. This was the first time since 1993 in which one of the reigning world champions competed in the match in which the winner could challenge them\u2014Lesnar's participation was used as a way to set up his WrestleMania challenger, which ended up being [[Drew McIntyre]], who eliminated Lesnar, won the Rumble match, and then challenged Lesnar for his title at [[WrestleMania 36]]. \n\nThe Royal Rumble winner may also choose to put his championship opportunity on the line in a match. This was first done in 1996, when Shawn Michaels risked his [[WrestleMania XII]] WWF World Heavyweight Championship opportunity in a match against [[Owen Hart]] at [[In Your House 6]]. The second time was in 2002, when [[Triple H]] lost his [[WrestleMania X8]] Undisputed WWF Championship opportunity at [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]] to [[Kurt Angle]], but regained his spot in a rematch against Angle on the following ''Raw''. The third time was in 2006, when [[Randy Orton]] defeated [[Rey Mysterio]]  at [[No Way Out (2006)|No Way Out]] for Mysterio's [[WrestleMania 22]] World Heavyweight Championship opportunity, though Mysterio was reinserted into the title match, making it a triple threat match. The fourth time was on the February 25, 2013 episode of ''Raw'', where John Cena successfully defended his [[WrestleMania 29]] WWE Championship opportunity in a match against [[CM Punk]]. The fifth time was in 2015 at [[Fastlane (2015)|Fastlane]], where Roman Reigns defended his [[WrestleMania 31]] WWE World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against [[Daniel Bryan]].\n\nDuring the

Their participation is counted as zero seconds, with the exception of Hornswoggle's appearance in 2008:\n\n#In [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991]], [[Randy Savage|\"Macho King\" Randy Savage]] was drawn 18th, but no-showed due to leaving the building after costing [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]] the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] against [[Sgt. Slaughter]].\n#In [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994]], [[Mike Shaw|Bastion Booger]] was drawn 25th, but no-showed due to suffering food poisoning before the match.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998]], [[The Harris Brothers|Skull]] was drawn 22nd, but no-showed due to being attacked by [[Los Boricuas]] after having been mistaken for [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004]], [[Spike Dudley]] was drawn 13th, but was attacked on the ramp by [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005]], [[Scotty 2 Hotty]] was drawn 15th, but was attacked on the ramp by [[Muhammad Hassan (wrestler)|Muhammad Hassan]].\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2008)|2008]], [[Hornswoggle]] was drawn 9th, but was not brought into the ring until towards the end of the match by [[Mark Henry]] and was saved by [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] (who was drawn 27th) and escorted to the back and never re-entered the match. Finlay would later be disqualified after coming out before his number came up and using his shillelagh to help Hornswoggle.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2015)|2015]], [[Curtis Axel]] was drawn 6th, but was attacked on the ramp by [[Erick Rowan]], who then illegally entered the match as he was not a competitor.<ref name=\"Rowan\">{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=WWE.com|title=Roman Reigns won the 2015 Royal Rumble Match|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/2015/2015-royal-rumble-match|website=wwe.com|accessdate=February 2, 2019}}</ref> Unlike other occasions, this was notable for actually being worked into a gimmick for Axel, where he began to imitate Hulk Hogan and wear shirts emblazoned with \"AxelMania\" and claim that he was never eliminated from the Royal Rumble, therefore he won it, deserving a spot in the main event of WrestleMania.\n\n==== Wrestlers who had their number stolen or were replaced ====\nSeveral times, wrestlers were drawn to compete and were instead either attacked backstage or pulled from the match at the last minute and replaced by other wrestlers.\n\n#In [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999]], [[Mosh (wrestler)|Mosh]] was drawn 11th, but was attacked by [[Mabel (wrestler)|Mabel]], who took Mosh's spot.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001]], the team of Lo Down ([[Mosh (wrestler)|Chaz]] and [[D'Lo Brown]]) defeated [[Kai En Tai|Kaientai]] ([[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]] and [[Taka Michinoku]]) to earn one entrance spot in the Royal Rumble match, but that was later overturned by [[Vince McMahon]] who entered [[Drew Carey]] in their spot.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] was drawn 21st, but was attacked by [[Mick Foley]], who took then Test's spot under orders from [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005]], [[Nunzio]] was drawn 20th, but had his spot stolen by [[Kurt Angle]] before the match, Angle then challenged Nunzio to fight for the spot.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2018)|2018]], [[Tye Dillinger]] was drawn 10th, but was attacked by [[Kevin Owens]] [[Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn|and]] [[Sami Zayn]], the latter of whom took Dillinger's spot.\n#In [[Royal Rumble (2019)|2019]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]] was slated for the 30th spot, but was attacked by [[Nia Jax]], who took his spot.\n\n==== Most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble ====\n(Six eliminations minimum). \n\nAs of the

In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighboring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centers providing free Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centers with another 9 more centers also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centers medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centers have specially appointed and trained doctors, counselors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centers are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centers have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government. The court further asked the government to give a clear-cut and \"workable\" solution response within a week's time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-11/india/28231314_1_hiv-patients-second-line-treatment-second-line-drugs|title=SC forces govt to agree to second-line ART to all AIDS patients|date=11 Dec 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/SC-cautions-govt-over-HIV-treatment/Article1-636976.aspx|title=SC cautions govt over HIV treatment|date=11 December 2010|work=Hindustan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n{{See also|Cost of HIV treatment}}\n\nHIV spending increased in India from 2003 to 2007, and fell by 15% in 2008 to 2009. Currently, India spends about 5% of its health budget on HIV/AIDS. Spending on HIV/AIDS may create a burden in the health sector which faces a variety of other challenges like malaria, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighbouring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centres providing free Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centres with another 9 more centres also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centres medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centres have specially appointed and trained doctors, counsellors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centres are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centres have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government.
