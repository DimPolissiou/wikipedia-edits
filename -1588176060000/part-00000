The club is based in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]] in the [[Inner West]] of Sydney, and plays home matches at [[Concord Oval]]. Concord holds a place in rugby history as a venue for the inaugural [[Rugby World Cup]] in 1987. West Harbour's major sponsor is Burwood RSL and post match functions are held at Club Burwood.\n\n== Club information ==\n\n:'''Uniform colours:''' Black, White and Red\n:'''Premiership Titles:''' 2 titles: 1902, 1929\n\n== Club history ==\n\n'''Beginnings'''\n\nWest Harbour R.F.C. was founded in 1900 as Western Suburbs D.R.U.F.C after an amalgamation between Burwood and Concord rugby clubs. The club originally fielded only two grade teams but still won the Sydney Premiership at its third attempt in 1902. Since then the club has won one other championship in 1929.\n\nThe Club\u2019s name was changed to Western Suburbs to satisfy municipal aldermen when it sought a lease on St Lukes Oval, later Concord Oval. Western Suburbs\u2019 boundaries were far-reaching in its early days because the club could draw on players from Concord to the Harbour, south to Port Hacking, north to the Parramatta River, and west to the Blue Mountains. When Parramatta, St George, Drummoyne, Gordon and Eastwood joined the competition these boundaries were reduced.\n\n'''Between the Wars'''\n\nWestern Suburbs enjoyed a golden era after the war when Secretary Francis Joseph Herlihy co-opted Tom.S.R (Iron Guts) Davis, Larry Wogan, and Charlie Rea to help lift the club\u2019s fortunes. They built a playing strength that enabled Western Suburbs to figure prominently in the competition for years and to win the competition in 1929\n\nThe brothers Geoff (1929) and Keith Storey (1936) entered international football from Western Suburbs followed by Sid King (1929), M.R.Blair (1931), T.S.Lawton (1929), A.Thorpe (1929), P.K.Collins (1937), R.L.F.Kelly (1936), R.E.M.McLaughlin (1936), T.P.Pauling (1936), and Cecil Ramalli (1938). Phil Hardcastle was an established Test player when he joined the club from Easts in 1948.\n\n'''Relegation and Promotion'''\n\nWestern Suburbs were unceremoniously relegated to the second division in 1952 and fared poorly until promoted back into 1st Division in 1966. It was at this point that the club\u2019s fortunes changed when Rufus Miahere joined as 1st Grade coach in 1970. Miahere began with seven wins in 1971 and eight wins in 1972. In 1973 he lifted the Club back to the glory it had enjoyed in the 1930\u2019s by winning 17 matches in a row. Western Suburbs won the Club Championships that year and the season was flawed only by a loss to Randwick in the Grand Final. That year Laurie Monaghan became the Club\u2019s first test player since World War II, followed shortly after by one of Sydney\u2019s true Rugby characters, Mick Ellem.\n\nThe Club was once again relegated to 2nd Division in 1980 and then promoted back to 1st Division in 1981. In 1982, the Club had discussions with the Sydney Rugby Union regarding the upgrade of Concord Oval. The Club made a donation of $250,000 to the NSWRU, which allowed the State Government to provide a further $1 million and saw Concord Oval transformed into a world class rugby venue, which in 1987 saw more than 25,000 people attend the World Cup semi-final match between Australia and France.\n\n'''Resurgence and Professionalism'''\n\nThe 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s saw a resurgence in the Club\u2019s strength. Stephen James represented Australia in a number of Test series from 1986 and Fili Finau wore the green and gold on a French Tour in 1993. \n\nIn 1995, the Club changed its name to the West Harbour Rugby Football Club to more truly reflect the Club\u2019s location in the inner west of the harbour city. In 1997, Fili Finau once again represented Australia, this time against New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup. Jason Madz and Fili Finau also featured prominently for the NSW Super 12 side during this period. \n\nSteve Devine represented NSW and Australia U/21\u2019s and played with the Waratahs before signing a Super 12 contract with the Auckland Blues. Steve was then selected as a member of the All Blacks eventually playing 13 tests for New Zealand. Pierre Hola capped off a fine 2001 season by being selected in the Tongan national team and was a member of the Tongan 2003 World Cup Squad.\n\nIn 2000/01 Des Tuiavii played for the ACT Brumbies before taking up a NSW Waratahs contract for the 2002/03 seasons. Des won both the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Player of the Year and the NSWRU Ken Catchpole Medal in 2001 and played his 100th 1st Grade game for West Harbour in 2003. Des finished a remarkable 2003 season by playing for the Samoan side in the 2003 World Cup.\n\nIn the early to mid 2000s, West Harbour had a number of players in the NSW Waratah and Junior Waratah squads including Lote Tuqiri, Timana Tahu, Chris O\u2019Young and Elia Tiqiri all represented the Waratahs in 2004. Chris Siale and Rodney Blake represented the Australia U/21 side in the IRB Championships in Scotland. Both subsequently signed Super 12 contracts. \n\nSeven West Harbour players Penny Anderson, Louise Ferris, Charmain Smith, Debby Hodgkinson, Tui Ormsby, Nyree Osieck, Pearl Palaialii represented the Australian Wallaroos at the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup in Spain in 2002. Debby Hodgkinson was named the SMH \u201cPlayer of the Year\u201d for the 2004 season.\n\n'''The Current Era'''\n\nSince 2010, the Club\u2019s fortunes have been mixed with periods of strong success and frustrating disappointments. With a seemingly transient playing population and a number of successive short term presidents and coaches, the Club has lacked a great deal of stability and has seen a high turnover of players.  \n\nThe tenure of experienced coach, Tod Louden, which came to an end at the culmination of the 2018 season saw another mass exodus of players. Yet the Club\u2019s newly appointed board acted quickly to engage long time club man, Mark Gudmenson, as Head Coach, who in turn was successful season in bringing a sense of stability to the Club for the 2019 season driven by a competitive 1st Grade team. \n\nWest Harbour is leaving Concord Oval in the 2020 season for two years as Canada Bay Council build a new state of the art stadium. The Club will be playing its home matches at Drummoyne Oval for the next two years, after which time West Harbour will return to Concord Oval, which will be the envy of the eleven Clubs in the Shute Shield. \n\n'''Representatives'''\n\nOverall 48 players who have played for the Club have gone on to represent the Wallabies, along with the large number of Wallabies and Wallaroos representative players. Due to the diverse nature of West Harbour Rugby Club, 36 players have gone on to represent other nations in international rugby including Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malta, Croatia and Lebanon. \n\n89 players have been selected for representative honours with the New South Wales Waratahs and many others have played with other Super Rugby franchises.\n\n==International representatives==\n{{col-float|firstcol=18em}}\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Stanley Wickham]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Warden Clarrie Prentice]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Larry Wogan]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Clarence S.

The club is based in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]] in the [[Inner West]] of Sydney, and plays home matches at [[Concord Oval]]. Concord holds a place in rugby history as a venue for the inaugural [[Rugby World Cup]] in 1987. West Harbour's major sponsor is Burwood RSL and post match functions are held at Club Burwood.\n\n== Club information ==\n\n:'''Uniform colours:''' Black, White and Red\n:'''Premiership Titles:''' 2 titles: 1902, 1929\n\n== Club history ==\n\n'''Beginnings'''\n\nWest Harbour R.F.C. was founded in 1900 as Western Suburbs D.R.U.F.C after an amalgamation between Burwood and Concord rugby clubs. The club originally fielded only two grade teams but still won the Sydney Premiership at its third attempt in 1902. Since then the club has won one other championship in 1929.\n\nThe Club\u2019s name was changed to Western Suburbs to satisfy municipal aldermen when it sought a lease on St Lukes Oval, later Concord Oval. Western Suburbs\u2019 boundaries were far-reaching in its early days because the club could draw on players from Concord to the Harbour, south to Port Hacking, north to the Parramatta River, and west to the Blue Mountains. When Parramatta, St George, Drummoyne, Gordon and Eastwood joined the competition these boundaries were reduced.\n\n'''Between the Wars'''\n\nWestern Suburbs enjoyed a golden era after the war when Secretary Francis Joseph Herlihy co-opted Tom.S.R (Iron Guts) Davis, Larry Wogan, and Charlie Rea to help lift the club\u2019s fortunes. They built a playing strength that enabled Western Suburbs to figure prominently in the competition for years and to win the competition in 1929\n\nThe brothers Geoff (1929) and Keith Storey (1936) entered international football from Western Suburbs followed by Sid King (1929), M.R.Blair (1931), T.S.Lawton (1929), A.Thorpe (1929), P.K.Collins (1937), R.L.F.Kelly (1936), R.E.M.McLaughlin (1936), T.P.Pauling (1936), and Cecil Ramalli (1938). Phil Hardcastle was an established Test player when he joined the club from Easts in 1948.\n\n'''Relegation and Promotion'''\n\nWestern Suburbs were unceremoniously relegated to the second division in 1952 and faired poorly until promoted back into 1st Division in 1966. It was at this point that the club\u2019s fortunes changed when Rufus Miahere joined as 1st Grade coach in 1970. Miahere began with seven wins in 1971 and eight wins in 1972. In 1973 he lifted the Club back to the glory it had enjoyed in the 1930\u2019s by winning 17 matches in a row. Western Suburbs won the Club Championships that year and the season was flawed only by a loss to Randwick in the Grand Final. That year Laurie Monaghan became the Club\u2019s first test player since World War II, followed shortly after by one of Sydney\u2019s true Rugby characters, Mick Ellem.\n\nThe Club was once again relegated to 2nd Division in 1980 and then promoted back to 1st Division in 1981. In 1982, the Club had discussions with the Sydney Rugby Union regarding the upgrade of Concord Oval. The Club made a donation of $250,000 to the NSWRU, which allowed the State Government to provide a further $1 million and saw Concord Oval transformed into a world class rugby venue, which in 1987 saw more than 25,000 people attend the World Cup semi-final match between Australia and France.\n\n'''Resurgence and Professionalism'''\n\nThe 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s saw a resurgence in the Club\u2019s strength. Stephen James represented Australia in a number of Test series from 1986 and Fili Finau wore the green and gold on a French Tour in 1993. \n\nIn 1995, the Club changed its name to the West Harbour Rugby Football Club to more truly reflect the Club\u2019s location in the inner west of the harbour city. In 1997, Fili Finau once again represented Australia, this time against New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup. Jason Madz and Fili Finau also featured prominently for the NSW Super 12 side during this period. \n\nSteve Devine represented NSW and Australia U/21\u2019s and played with the Waratahs before signing a Super 12 contract with the Auckland Blues. Steve was then selected as a member of the All Blacks eventually playing 13 tests for New Zealand. Pierre Hola capped off a fine 2001 season by being selected in the Tongan national team and was a member of the Tongan 2003 World Cup Squad.\n\nIn 2000/01 Des Tuiavii played for the ACT Brumbies before taking up a NSW Waratahs contract for the 2002/03 seasons. Des won both the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Player of the Year and the NSWRU Ken Catchpole Medal in 2001 and played his 100th 1st Grade game for West Harbour in 2003. Des finished a remarkable 2003 season by playing for the Samoan side in the 2003 World Cup.\n\nIn the early to mid 2000s, West Harbour had a number of players in the NSW Waratah and Junior Waratah squads including Lote Tuqiri, Timana Tahu, Chris O\u2019Young and Elia Tiqiri all represented the Waratahs in 2004. Chris Siale and Rodney Blake represented the Australia U/21 side in the IRB Championships in Scotland. Both subsequently signed Super 12 contracts. \n\nSeven West Harbour players Penny Anderson, Louise Ferris, Charmain Smith, Debby Hodgkinson, Tui Ormsby, Nyree Osieck, Pearl Palaialii represented the Australian Wallaroos at the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup in Spain in 2002. Debby Hodgkinson was named the SMH \u201cPlayer of the Year\u201d for the 2004 season.\n\n'''The Current Era'''\n\nSince 2010, the Club\u2019s fortunes have been mixed with periods of strong success and frustrating disappointments. With a seemingly transient playing population and a number of successive short term presidents and coaches, the Club has lacked a great deal of stability and has seen a high turnover of players.  \n\nThe tenure of experienced coach, Tod Louden, which came to an end at the culmination of the 2018 season saw another mass exodus of players. Yet the Club\u2019s newly appointed board acted quickly to engage long time club man, Mark Gudmenson, as Head Coach, who in turn was successful season in bringing a sense of stability to the Club for the 2019 season driven by a competitive 1st Grade team. \n\nWest Harbour is leaving Concord Oval in the 2020 season for two years as Canada Bay Council build a new state of the art stadium. The Club will be playing its home matches at Drummoyne Oval for the next two years, after which time West Harbour will return to Concord Oval, which will be the envy of the eleven Clubs in the Shute Shield. \n\n'''Representatives'''\n\nOverall 48 players who have played for the Club have gone on to represent the Wallabies, along with the large number of Wallabies and Wallaroos representative players. Due to the diverse nature of West Harbour Rugby Club, 36 players have gone on to represent other nations in international rugby including Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malta, Croatia and Lebanon. \n\n89 players have been selected for representative honours with the New South Wales Waratahs and many others have played with other Super Rugby franchises.\n\n==International representatives==\n{{col-float|firstcol=18em}}\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Stanley Wickham]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Warden Clarrie Prentice]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Larry Wogan]]\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Clarence S.

The Griffins are a [[nuclear family]] consisting of the married couple [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], their three children [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], their [[anthropomorphic]] [[dog]] [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], and they have several unknown children showcased once or twice throughout the series, although that\u2019s all we hear of them. They live at [[List of places on Family Guy#Houses|31 Spooner Street]] in the fictional town of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]], [[Rhode Island]]. Their family car is a red sixth-generation [[Ford Country Squire]]. They were created by [[Seth MacFarlane]], in model of his two [[animated cartoon|animated films]], ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|The Life of Larry]]'' and ''Larry & Steve''. The family debuted on January 31, 1999, after [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the [[List of Family Guy episodes|episode]] \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\".\n\nAlongside the six main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The most commonly recurring characters are Lois's parents [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] and [[Barbara Pewterschmidt]], and Peter's now-deceased parents [[Francis Griffin (Family Guy)|Francis]], and [[Thelma Griffin]]. Other recurring family members include Lois's two siblings, Carol and Patrick, as well as Brian's cousin Jasper.\n\n==Creation==\nMacFarlane conceived the idea for ''Family Guy'' in 1998, developing it out of his two short films.

Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. Lois's [[Morality|morals]] are often questionable, as she went through a brief period of [[kleptomania]] in the episode \"[[Breaking Out Is Hard to Do]]\", for which she went to [[prison]]. She also showed a [[gambling]] addiction when the family went to an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[casino]] in \"[[The Son Also Draws]]\" during the first season. Various episodes have hinted that Lois is an avid drug user, but this is shown most clearly in \"[[Deep Throats]]\", where she revealed that she smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] when she was pregnant with Stewie, a claim backed-up by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] on a DVD commentary. Also, when asked by Peter where she got a tattoo on her lower back, she replied, 'Oh, I don't know Peter, [[Methamphetamine|meth]] is a hell of a drug' (\"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\"). When Meg is thought to have become pregnant, Lois tells her to \"smoke and drink a lot\" (when Meg does not want to have an abortion, which Lois hinted at beforehand) \"but don't start, then chicken out halfway throughout the pregnancy, 'cause then you'll wind up with Chris,\" which implies she smoked and consumed alcohol while pregnant with Chris.\n\n===Meg Griffin===\n{{main|Meg Griffin}}\n'''Megan/Megatron''' \"'''Meg'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Mila Kunis]]. Meg is a self-conscious and emotionally vulnerable teenage girl. She is currently 18 years old and enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Her numerous insecurities cause her to desperately try to be part of the \"in-crowd\", but this only results in her getting rebuffed by [[List of characters in Family Guy#James Woods Regional High School|Connie D'Amico]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408574/movieconnections|title=IMDB&nbsp;\u2014 Family Guy&nbsp;\u2014 Stew-Roids (2009) Movie Connections}}</ref> the bullying head [[cheerleader]] of her school. Initially valued to the family in earlier seasons, her standing in the family's \"pecking order\" is now much more similar to that of the stereotypical \"[[Middle child syndrome|middle child]]\" (despite being the oldest of the Griffin children by age) such as being the butt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s jokes due to her \"homeliness\" and lack of self-confidence, despite frequently proving to be more responsible and reasonable than the rest of the family. Despite all this, another student named [[List of characters in Family Guy#The Goldmans|Neil Goldman]] has a crush on her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2DB103DF931A25754C0A9639C8B63|title=Sharing the Ratings Spoils |last=Aurthur|first=Kate|date=2005-07-12|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>\nAt times, she has been shown to be so self-conscious about herself that she engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention.\n\n===Chris Griffin===\n{{main|Chris Griffin}}\n'''Christopher Cross''' \"'''Chris'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Seth Green]]. Chris is a friendly and laid-back teenage boy. Physically, he is a younger version of Peter, but intellectually, he often shows better potential, as shown from moments of articulation and coherence within his speech, and makes good points when especially talking about films, TV series, actors and actresses, etc. Similar to Meg, Chris deals with the problems that most teenage boys face: acne, girls, and school. He is currently 15 years old and, like Meg, is enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. On the volume 1 DVD box set, it stated that Chris \"would not hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog.\" Chris is also willing to take drastic measures to get what he wants or needs, especially when it comes to getting good grades. He, at one point, believed that he got a bad grade on a mathematics test when he tickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and accidentally puncturing a lobe.\n\n===Stewie Griffin===\n{{main|Stewie Griffin}}\n'''Stewart Gilligan''' \"'''Stewie'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. Stewie is the youngest Griffin family member at one year old. Stewie originally served as the main villain of the show. Though he was originally an antagonistic [[Child prodigy|child-genius]] sociopath, hell-bent on killing his mother and taking over the world, in more recent episodes he is a much more friendly yet flamboyant (and possibly homosexual) character, though nonetheless still rambunctious and disrespecting towards his elders and peers. Despite having a rivalry with the family dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], this seems to have ended as he and Brian now share a very close friendship, and they admitted that they loved each other, in the episode \"[[Brian & Stewie]]\". Stewie is considered to be the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |date=2005-01-26 |author=Nathan Rabin |work=[[The A.V.

Brian is often the voice of reason for the family, frequently reminding Peter how stupid or corrupt his ideas are. He also has a very close friendship with Stewie, and the two of them have been at the center of some of the most critically acclaimed episodes during the series, most notably the [[Road to...

Their family car is a red sixth-generation [[Ford Country Squire]]. They were created by [[Seth MacFarlane]], in model of his two [[animated cartoon|animated films]], ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|The Life of Larry]]'' and ''Larry & Steve''. The family debuted on January 31, 1999, after [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the [[List of Family Guy episodes|episode]] \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\".\n\nAlongside the six main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The most commonly recurring characters are Lois's parents [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] and [[Barbara Pewterschmidt]], and Peter's now-deceased parents [[Francis Griffin (Family Guy)|Francis]], and [[Thelma Griffin]]. Other recurring family members include Lois's two siblings, Carol and Patrick, as well as Brian's cousin Jasper.\n\n==Creation==\nMacFarlane conceived the idea for ''Family Guy'' in 1998, developing it out of his two short films. MacFarlane caught the attention of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and was given $50,000 to make a pilot. MacFarlane completed the 11-minute pilot after six months of hand animation. Upon review, Fox gave the green light to ''Family Guy'' as a series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.video.yahoo.com/watch/1929627/2891929 |title=Inside Media at MTR (2006): ''Family Guy'' 2 |work=Yahoo!

Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. Lois's [[Morality|morals]] are often questionable, as she went through a brief period of [[kleptomania]] in the episode \"[[Breaking Out Is Hard to Do]]\", for which she went to [[prison]]. She also showed a [[gambling]] addiction when the family went to an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[casino]] in \"[[The Son Also Draws]]\" during the first season. Various episodes have hinted that Lois is an avid drug user, but this is shown most clearly in \"[[Deep Throats]]\", where she revealed that she smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] when she was pregnant with Stewie, a claim backed-up by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] on a DVD commentary. Also, when asked by Peter where she got a tattoo on her lower back, she replied, 'Oh, I don't know Peter, [[Methamphetamine|meth]] is a hell of a drug' (\"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\"). When Meg is thought to have become pregnant, Lois tells her to \"smoke and drink a lot\" (when Meg does not want to have an abortion, which Lois hinted at beforehand) \"but don't start, then chicken out halfway throughout the pregnancy, 'cause then you'll wind up with Chris,\" which implies she smoked and consumed alcohol while pregnant with Chris.\n\n===Meg Griffin===\n{{main|Meg Griffin}}\n'''Megan/Megatron''' \"'''Meg'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Mila Kunis]]. Meg is a self-conscious and emotionally vulnerable teenage girl. She is currently 18 years old and enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Her numerous insecurities cause her to desperately try to be part of the \"in-crowd\", but this only results in her getting rebuffed by [[List of characters in Family Guy#James Woods Regional High School|Connie D'Amico]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408574/movieconnections|title=IMDB&nbsp;\u2014 Family Guy&nbsp;\u2014 Stew-Roids (2009) Movie Connections}}</ref> the bullying head [[cheerleader]] of her school. Initially valued to the family in earlier seasons, her standing in the family's \"pecking order\" is now much more similar to that of the stereotypical \"[[Middle child syndrome|middle child]]\" (despite being the oldest of the Griffin children by age) such as being the butt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s jokes due to her \"homeliness\" and lack of self-confidence, despite frequently proving to be more responsible and reasonable than the rest of the family. Despite all this, another student named [[List of characters in Family Guy#The Goldmans|Neil Goldman]] has a crush on her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2DB103DF931A25754C0A9639C8B63|title=Sharing the Ratings Spoils |last=Aurthur|first=Kate|date=2005-07-12|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>\nAt times, she has been shown to be so self-conscious about herself that she engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention.\n\n===Chris Griffin===\n{{main|Chris Griffin}}\n'''Christopher Cross''' \"'''Chris'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Seth Green]]. Chris is a friendly and laid-back teenage boy. Physically, he is a younger version of Peter, but intellectually, he often shows better potential, as shown from moments of articulation and coherence within his speech, and makes good points when especially talking about films, TV series, actors and actresses, etc. Similar to Meg, Chris deals with the problems that most teenage boys face: acne, girls, and school. He is currently 15 years old and, like Meg, is enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. On the volume 1 DVD box set, it stated that Chris \"would not hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog.\" Chris is also willing to take drastic measures to get what he wants or needs, especially when it comes to getting good grades. He, at one point, believed that he got a bad grade on a mathematics test when he tickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and accidentally puncturing a lobe.\n\n===Stewie Griffin===\n{{main|Stewie Griffin}}\n'''Stewart Gilligan''' \"'''Stewie'''\" '''Griffin''', voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. Stewie is the youngest Griffin family member at one year old. Stewie originally served as the main villain of the show. Though he was originally an antagonistic [[Child prodigy|child-genius]] sociopath, hell-bent on killing his mother and taking over the world, in more recent episodes he is a much more friendly yet flamboyant (and possibly homosexual) character, though nonetheless still rambunctious and disrespecting towards his elders and peers. Despite having a rivalry with the family dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], this seems to have ended as he and Brian now share a very close friendship, and they admitted that they loved each other, in the episode \"[[Brian & Stewie]]\". Stewie is considered to be the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |date=2005-01-26 |author=Nathan Rabin |work=[[The A.V.

Brian has lived with the Griffin family since Peter picked him up as a stray. Peter is his best friend, despite Brian's superior intelligence. Brian is often the voice of reason for the family, frequently reminding Peter how stupid or corrupt his ideas are. He also has a very close friendship with Stewie, and the two of them have been at the center of some of the most critically acclaimed episodes during the series, most notably the [[Road to...

After noticing that the limousines used in funeral processions were not being used at night, he convinced his father-in-law to let him establish a separate company that would lease out the vehicles in the evenings.<ref name=Cohen /> The company was solidly profitable<ref name=Cohen /><ref name=Cohen2>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/22/magazine/a-78-million-year-steve-ross-defends-his-paycheck.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm New York Times: \"A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck\" BY ROGER COHEN] March 22, 1992</ref> and enabled Ross to obtain bank financing to start a rental company, Abbey Rent a Car.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nHe later merged Abbey with a parking lot operator, the [[Kinney Parking Company]],<ref name=Cohen /> which was then owned by underworld crime figures [[Manny Kimmel]] and [[Abner Zwillman]], and added an office cleaning business (which was jointly owned by the funeral home and a cousin of his father-in-law). Kinney was taken public in 1962 with a market valuation of $12.5 million.<ref name=Cohen /> In 1964, Kinney purchased wood flooring manufacturer Circle Floor from [[Seymour Milstein|Seymour]] and [[Paul Milstein]] for $15 million with Paul remaining as manager of the unit until 1971.<ref name=NYTThrottle>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/realestate/milstein-opens-throttle-as-builder.html New York Times: \"Milstein Opens Throttle as Builder\"] October 18, 1981</ref>\n\nRoss served as company president and moved the firm from downtown New York to 10 [[Rockefeller Plaza]]. In 1966, Kinney expanded into the entertainment business by purchasing the [[Ashley-Famous]] talent agency (founded by [[Ted Ashley]]) and then in 1969, Kinney paid $400 million for the ailing [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] film studio and record business. Three years later, after spinning off its non-entertainment assets, Kinney National Services renamed itself [[Warner Communications]]<ref name=Cohen /> with Ross serving as co-CEO from 1969 to 1972.<ref name=Cohen />\n\n===Warner Communications===\nIn 1971, Warner expanded into the cable television business by purchasing various small cable companies. Ross competed directly with the Big Three television networks that dominated television broadcasting, believing in the potential of ''narrowcasting'' whereby separate cable channels were developed to target specific audiences with narrower interests, mirroring the radio station model.<ref name=Cohen /> This pioneering approach led to the creation of the successful cable TV channels [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]] which were both later sold at a great profit.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn 1972, Ross was appointed CEO, president and chairman of [[Warner Communications]]. He introduced an incentive-based compensation program and delegated responsibility to his middle managers. His support and commitment to his employees, combined with lucrative financial incentives and a hands-off management style, inspired deep loyalty. Many employees saw him as a father figure: \"Steve was very much what I wish my father was,\" [[Steven Spielberg]] said.<ref name=Bruck>{{cite web |url= http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1912 |publisher=Bruck, Connie.

In 1983, Atari collapsed, leaving [[Warner Communications]] vulnerable to a hostile takeover. [[Rupert Murdoch]] tried to buy Warner, but Ross was able to impede him by selling 20 percent of Warner to [[Chris-Craft Industries]] (then controlled by Herbert J. Siegel).<ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn 1979, needing financing to further expand its cable television business, Ross partnered with [[American Express]], convincing its executives on the potential of selling AmEx credit cards direct to Warner cable TV customers. [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment|Warner-AmEx Cable]] was established and Warner received a much needed capital injection. AmEx's cross-sale expectations never materialized and in 1984, Warner bought out American Express's remaining share. The cable TV business eventually became the cornerstone of the company until being spun off in 2009.<ref name=Freidman>{{cite web |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/would-steve-ross-have-done/story.aspx?guid={8794D72E-BBC0-46D5-ABC3-736BD89653C8}&dist=msr_1&print=true&dist=printMidSection\n|publisher= Freidman, Jon.

The merger was seen as a perfect fit: Warner's business was 40 percent international while Time's business was 91% percent domestic; Warner had no magazines while Time had 23 titles; Warner had the world's largest record business while Time was not involved in music; and both were big in the capital intensive cable business where economies of scale mattered.<ref name=Cohen2 /> Originally advertised as a combination of equals with both Ross and J. Richard Munro of [[Time Inc.]] listed as Co-Chief Operating Officers, within a year of the merger, Ross became the sole CEO.<ref name=Gomery>{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/timewarner/timewarner.htm |publisher= Gomery, Douglas. The Museum of Broadcast Communications. |title= Time Warner}}</ref> By 1989, Time Warner owned ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazines (the three largest advertising draws in American publishing); the [[Warner Bros.]] studio in Hollywood; the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] record companies; [[Warner Books]]; [[DC Comics]]; [[HBO|Home Box Office]] and some of the country's largest cable television systems.\n\n==Visionary==\nRoss moved before many of his competitors to bet heavily on the worldwide potential of cable television, records, videos, and other experiments. Some of his ideas were successful and others failed, but he definitively influenced the development of media and entertainment with his ideas. \"If you're not a risk-taker,\" he once said, \"you should get the hell out of business.\"<ref name=Cohen />\n\nRoss's early interest in cable television helped him envision [[narrowcasting]]\u2014cable channels created for specific audiences\u2014[[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] were expressly launched and developed to serve young audiences. Today, these two channels are still successful, and the cable television universe is now filled with hundreds of channels, specializing in many topics.\n  \nOther projects that Ross supported were not as successful as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], but certainly left a mark in television and helped shape the TV we are enjoying today. One important project was [[QUBE]]. Qube was launched in 1977 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and was Ross' vision of how television could become interactive. Although this trial was not successful, it was an important step for what became known as advanced television. In some ways, the Qube project failed because it was ahead of its time. QUBE led to further attempts by [[Warner Communications|Warner]] to integrate more services to cable television. Prominent among these was the [[Full Service Network]] that was launched in 1994 in [[Orlando, Florida]]. \nRoss also supported [[Atari]] from 1977 to 1983, taking the first widely successful video game console to millions of homes around the world. For several years, Atari was a lucrative business for [[Warner Communications]], but in 1983 it collapsed.\nAlthough many of Ross' overly ambitious projects failed, some of these failures shaped future success in the video game and cable industries.\n\n==Soccer==\nRoss is also known for promoting and popularizing soccer in the USA. He was amongst the group of people that founded [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]] in 1971. Driven by Ross's vision and financially backed by his Warner Communications, the club brought soccer superstars [[Pel\u00e9]] and [[Franz Beckenbauer]], as well as other prominent players such as [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], [[Vladislav Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Johan Neeskens]], and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=cosmos|title= When Soccer Ruled The USA|author= David Hirshey |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate = June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRoss was introduced to the sport during the late 1960s by one of his business executives [[Nesuhi Ertegun]] from [[Atlantic Records]], the record company co-founded by Nesuhi's brother and also soccer enthusiast [[Ahmet Ertegun]]. The two brothers worked for Ross in the early 1970s after Atlantic got bought in 1967 by [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] that in turn got bought by Ross's [[Kinney National Company]] two years later. When Nesuhi Ertegun had a business opportunity that would require leaving the company, Ross offered anything in an attempt to keep him. Ertegun expressed a desire to have a soccer club created and Ross, a fan of sports in general, obliged. Following [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Mexico]], the event that Erteguns used to further establish contacts in the soccer world by throwing lavish parties one of which was attended by Pel\u00e9, the brothers came back to New York and held Ross to his promise so he and longtime associate Jay Emmett called and convinced eight other executives to contribute $35,000 each towards establishing a new soccer franchise that would compete in the struggling [[North American Soccer League]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Newsham|first=Gavin |date=2007 |title=Once in a Lifetime: The Incredible Story of the New York Cosmos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zusmrbrHmdUC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=steve+ross+nasl+founding&source=bl&ots=sJLIAkqC08&sig=lkIwCSuYP_8IrIjMVpi-4lvkol0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9CPyU-3QOJD9yQTq9IKQDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=steve%20ross%20nasl%20founding&f=false|location= |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |page= |isbn=9781555848699 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Founding the New York Cosmos===\nThe franchise called the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]] was created in early 1971 with Englishman [[Clive Toye]] as its first general manager and 37-year-old [[Gordon Bradley]] as the player/coach. Playing out their [[1971 North American Soccer League season|debut season]] in almost empty stadiums with virtually no media coverage, the Cosmos were a rag-tag semi-professional operation, but most importantly Ross was hooked and very much interested to see the team do well. Scared of losing money, the ten original investors sold their stake in the franchise to newly created Warner Communications (the company where Ross was CEO and chairman) for $1. Essentially, with the sale, Ross added the modest franchise to the vast media empire he was in charge of running.\n\n===Bringing Pel\u00e9 to America===\nFollowing the first few seasons in obscurity, Ross decided that signing a big marquee name was the way forward to achieving greater prominence and ultimately securing the league's long-term dream\u2014a network television deal.\n\nThe idea of bringing Pel\u00e9 to America had actually been around for a while as NASL commissioner [[Phil Woosnam]] and eventual Cosmos GM Clive Toye discussed it as far back as 1970 and even made an approach to the player in spring 1971, one month after the Cosmos had been formed. However, in 1975 with Ross willing to spend the big money, conditions were finally there to make the dream transfer happen. He sent Emmett, Toye, Cosmos vice-president Raphael de la Sierra, and Nesuhi Ertegun to Brazil where they met with 34-year-old Pel\u00e9 at a seaside resort and played soccer with him on the beach. Since by this time [[Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus]] also started sniffing around Pel\u00e9 in an attempt to bring him to Europe for the first time, the Cosmos delegation used the possibility of making soccer big in a country new to the sport as their main lure and by the end of the day, the Brazilian agreed in principle to come to New York. The actual negotiation with Warner Communications lawyer Norman Samnick, who was deployed to Brazil by Ross, turned out to be a little more difficult: Ross was willing to risk $2 million for three years of play while Pel\u00e9 demanded $5 million for two years. In the end, the deal agreed was a complex five-part contract worth around $4.5 million in total that included $1 million for three years of play, $1 million for ten years of marketing rights, $1 million for a fourteen-year PR contract, and another $1 million for a music contract. Warner Communications money thus managed to lure arguably then still the biggest name in soccer out of retirement. In addition to huge amounts of money, due to Pel\u00e9's special status in Brazil as the country's national treasure, getting him to leave his homeland for the first time in his career involved a lot of politics as well, especially when the Brazilian president demanded that Pel\u00e9 play another year in Brazil for the \"good of his people\". Ross called on his political connections in an attempt to soften the Brazilian government's position and eventually managed to get to the US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], who personally called his Brazilian counterpart telling him that Pel\u00e9's move to New York would be a huge step forward in the [[Brazil \u2013 United States relations|US\u2013Brazil relations]].\n\nPel\u00e9's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the USA. From the moment he signed his contract at the [[21 Club]] on 10 June 1975 in front of ecstatic Ross and a crush of worldwide media, the player's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to the sport in America.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/sports/soccer-pele-in-town-is-still-making-right-moves.html |title= SOCCER; Pele, in Town, Is Still Making Right Moves|author=Alex Yannis |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = April 25, 1991 }}</ref> His debut NASL match five days later versus [[Dallas Tornado]] at the dilapidated [[Downing Stadium]] on [[Randall's Island]] was broadcast live on [[CBS]] network. It was the Cosmos tenth match of the [[1975 North American Soccer League season|season]] and led by the Brazilian, who recorded an assist and a goal, they managed to come back from two goals down for the 2\u20132 final score. The contest was also Pel\u00e9's first competitive match in eight months since his last outing with [[Santos FC]] in October 1974. He would eventually end up with 5 goals in his debut season during which his biggest challenge became figuring out how to fit into this team of journeymen players with abilities far inferior to his. Still his biggest impact was on the sport in New York and the rest of America as Cosmos' home attendance got tripled in just half the season he was there. They also played in front of huge crowds on the road since everyone wanted to see Pel\u00e9 - towards the end of the season when he pulled a hamstring and couldn't suit up, 20,000 fans in Philadelphia showed up just to see him in street clothes. Furthermore, the league's profile got raised as other NASL teams - encouraged by Ross' investment in Pel\u00e9 and the prominence his arrival brought to the Cosmos franchise - started bringing over more big-name aging foreign stars such as [[George Best]] who was about to turn 30, 31-year-old [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], 34-year-old [[Geoff Hurst]], and 35-year-old [[Bobby Moore]].\n\n===More big names arrive in New York===\nSince the Cosmos failed to make the playoffs in Pel\u00e9's debut season, for the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|next season]], Ross decided to complement his superstar with more prominent names from overseas, the biggest of which was 29-year-old temperamental Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia from [[S.S. Lazio]]. The striker became an undeniable goal-scoring hit on the pitch with 19 goals in 19 league appearances that season, but his style of play as well as his egotistical and arrogant manner also got him many detractors both within and outside of the club. However, he endeared himself to Ross as the two soon became very close friends. Due to increased interest, the team moved to Yankee Stadium. Though the Brazilian midfield organizer and the Italian striker quickly developed an uneasy relationship, thanks to their assists and goals, respectively, the club managed to make the playoffs, losing to underdogs [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] led by Rodney Marsh in the conference semifinal series 3 games to 1. Pel\u00e9 still got the league MVP honors and Chinaglia became the league's top goalscorer. Though furious over the early playoff exit, Ross immediately took the team on an exhibition summer tour of Europe with stops to play friendly games in England, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. Though hugely expensive, the tour generated plenty of publicity for Warner Communications.\n\nThe [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977 NASL season]]\u2014Pel\u00e9's final season before retirement\u2014began at the newly built [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey as New York Cosmos dropped \"New York\" from its name to become just the Cosmos. With the new giant home, Ross decided to Americanize the experience of going to a Cosmos game with cheerleaders, halftime show, and mascots. On the field, however, the squad got internationalized even further with a roster that had players from every corner of the world. Attendance rose slightly to just over 20,000 in the first five games (3 of which Cosmos lost), but still not enough to Ross' liking. In search of more people in the seats, Ross decided to raise the bar again. He reached for the chequebook midway through the season and looked oversees for more big stars, singing 31-year-old German superstar Franz Beckenbauer from [[Bayern Munich]] in May 1977. The German's debut was a 4-2 loss away at Tampa while the following week Cosmos beat Toronto at home in front of 31,000 fans. Ross was happy with the attendance increase, but wanted even more and to that end enlisted celebrities that did business with Warner Communications to make publicized appearances at Cosmos home games. People like [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Steven Spielberg]], etc. became a regular sight in the Cosmos locker room and in the luxury boxes at the Giants Stadium. Other changes were in order too as general manager Toye and head coach Bradley got fired and Tampa Bay's [[Eddie Firmani]] became the new coach. The team's striker Chinaglia was said to be the driving influence on Ross to hire Chinaglia's good friend Firmani as Chinaglia and Ross developed a personal relationship. Chinaglia thrived under Firmani, scoring goals one after another. The team's play as well as the attendance also started to pick up - led by Pele's hat-trick, the Cosmos finally managed to avenge the losses to Tampa Bay by beating them at home in front 62,394 fans. However, this was followed by another inexplicable dip in form with five losses in seven games. Ross reacted immediately, throwing more big money into the squad, signing Brazil national team's former inspirational captain defender Carlos Alberto who was about to turn 33 years of age. He joined the squad with only four games remaining in the 1977 regular season. By this time, the attendance was rising sharply as the team as well as the league started to catch major buzz. The summer of 1977 was the franchise's first true foray into big time: on 14 August, the Giants Stadium was sold out for the Cosmos first game of the playoffs against [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977\u20131983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] with 77,691 people in the stands. The Cosmos finally won the title defeating [[Seattle Sounders (1974\u20131983)|Seattle Sounders]] in the Soccer Bowl during late August as Beckenbauer became league MVP and Pel\u00e9 retired in style.\n\n===Heading US bid to host the 1986 FIFA World Cup===\nIn November 1982, when [[Colombia]], the originally selected [[FIFA World Cup hosts|host]] of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], gave up on organizing the event, for economic reasons, Ross called upon all his soccer connections and campaigned hard to bring the tournament to the US including meeting with FIFA president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]], but in May 1983 [[FIFA]] decided on [[Mexico]] as the replacement host.<ref name=Cosmos>{{cite web |url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/reviewsnews.php?id=15251|publisher= Douglas, Edward.

After noticing that the limousines used in funeral processions were not being used at night, he convinced his father-in-law to let him establish a separate company that would lease out the vehicles in the evenings.<ref name=Cohen /> The company was solidly profitable<ref name=Cohen /><ref name=Cohen2>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/22/magazine/a-78-million-year-steve-ross-defends-his-paycheck.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm New York Times: \"A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck\" BY ROGER COHEN] March 22, 1992</ref> and enabled Ross to obtain bank financing to start a rental company, Abbey Rent a Car.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nHe later merged Abbey with a parking lot operator, the [[Kinney Parking Company]],<ref name=Cohen /> which was then owned by underworld crime figures [[Manny Kimmel]] and [[Abner Zwillman]], and added an office cleaning business (which was jointly owned by the funeral home and a cousin of his father-in-law). Kinney was taken public in 1962 with a market valuation of $12.5 million.<ref name=Cohen /> In 1964, Kinney purchased wood flooring manufacturer Circle Floor from [[Seymour Milstein|Seymour]] and [[Paul Milstein]] for $15 million with Paul remaining as manager of the unit until 1971.<ref name=NYTThrottle>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/realestate/milstein-opens-throttle-as-builder.html New York Times: \"Milstein Opens Throttle as Builder\"] October 18, 1981</ref>\n\nRoss served as company president and moved the firm from downtown New York to 10 [[Rockefeller Plaza]]. In 1966, Kinney expanded into the entertainment business by purchasing the [[Ashley-Famous]] talent agency (founded by [[Ted Ashley]]) and then in 1969, Kinney paid $400 million for the ailing [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] film studio and record business. Three years later, after spinning off its non-entertainment assets, Kinney National Services renamed itself [[Warner Communications]]<ref name=Cohen /> with Ross serving as co-CEO from 1969 to 1972.<ref name=Cohen />\n\n===Warner Communications===\nIn 1971, Warner expanded into the cable television business by purchasing various small cable companies. Ross competed directly with the Big Three television networks that dominated television broadcasting, believing in the potential of ''narrowcasting'' whereby separate cable channels were developed to target specific audiences with narrower interests, mirroring the radio station model.<ref name=Cohen /> This pioneering approach led to the creation of the successful cable TV channels [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]] which were both later sold at a great profit.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn 1972, Ross was appointed CEO, president and chairman of [[Warner Communications]]. He introduced an incentive-based compensation program and delegated responsibility to his middle managers. His support and commitment to his employees, combined with lucrative financial incentives and a hands-off management style, inspired deep loyalty. Many employees saw him as a father figure: \"Steve was very much what I wish my father was,\" [[Steven Spielberg]] said.<ref name=Bruck>{{cite web |url= http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1912 |publisher=Bruck, Connie.

In 1983, Atari collapsed, leaving [[Warner Communications]] vulnerable to a hostile takeover. [[Rupert Murdoch]] tried to buy Warner, but Ross was able to impede him by selling 20 percent of Warner to [[Chris-Craft Industries]] (then controlled by Herbert J. Siegel).<ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn 1979, needing financing to further expand its cable television business, Ross partnered with [[American Express]], convincing its executives on the potential of selling AmEx credit cards direct to Warner cable TV customers. [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment|Warner-AmEx Cable]] was established and Warner received a much needed capital injection. AmEx's cross-sale expectations never materialized and in 1984, Warner bought out American Express's remaining share. The cable TV business eventually became the cornerstone of the company until being spun off in 2009.<ref name=Freidman>{{cite web |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/would-steve-ross-have-done/story.aspx?guid={8794D72E-BBC0-46D5-ABC3-736BD89653C8}&dist=msr_1&print=true&dist=printMidSection\n|publisher= Freidman, Jon.

The merger was seen as a perfect fit: Warner's business was 40 percent international while Time's business was 91% percent domestic; Warner had no magazines while Time had 23 titles; Warner had the world's largest record business while Time was not involved in music; and both were big in the capital intensive cable business where economies of scale mattered.<ref name=Cohen2 /> Originally advertised as a combination of equals with both Ross and J. Richard Munro of [[Time Inc.]] listed as Co-Chief Operating Officers, within a year of the merger, Ross became the sole CEO.<ref name=Gomery>{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/timewarner/timewarner.htm |publisher= Gomery, Douglas. The Museum of Broadcast Communications. |title= Time Warner}}</ref> By 1989, Time Warner owned ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazines (the three largest advertising draws in American publishing); the [[Warner Bros.]] studio in Hollywood; the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] record companies; [[Warner Books]]; [[DC Comics]]; [[HBO|Home Box Office]] and some of the country's largest cable television systems.\n\n==Visionary==\nRoss moved before many of his competitors to bet heavily on the worldwide potential of cable television, records, videos, and other experiments. Some of his ideas were successful and others failed, but he definitively influenced the development of media and entertainment with his ideas. \"If you're not a risk-taker,\" he once said, \"you should get the hell out of business.\"<ref name=Cohen />\n\nRoss's early interest in cable television helped him envision [[narrowcasting]]\u2014cable channels created for specific audiences\u2014[[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] were expressly launched and developed to serve young audiences. Today, these two channels are still successful, and the cable television universe is now filled with hundreds of channels, specializing in many topics.\n  \nOther projects that Ross supported were not as successful as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], but certainly left a mark in television and helped shape the TV we are enjoying today. One important project was [[QUBE]]. Qube was launched in 1977 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and was Ross' vision of how television could become interactive. Although this trial was not successful, it was an important step for what became known as advanced television. In some ways, the Qube project failed because it was ahead of its time. QUBE led to further attempts by [[Warner Communications|Warner]] to integrate more services to cable television. Prominent among these was the [[Full Service Network]] that was launched in 1994 in [[Orlando, Florida]]. \nRoss also supported [[Atari]] from 1977 to 1983, taking the first widely successful video game console to millions of homes around the world. For several years, Atari was a lucrative business for [[Warner Communications]], but in 1983 it collapsed.\nAlthough many of Ross' overly ambitious projects failed, some of these failures shaped future success in the video game and cable industries.\n\n==Soccer==\nRoss is also known for promoting and popularizing soccer in the USA. He was amongst the group of people that founded [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]] in 1971. Driven by Ross's vision and financially backed by his Warner Communications, the club brought soccer superstars [[Pel\u00e9]] and [[Franz Beckenbauer]], as well as other prominent players such as [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], [[Vladislav Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Johan Neeskens]], and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=cosmos|title= When Soccer Ruled The USA|author= David Hirshey |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate = June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRoss was introduced to the sport during the late 1960s by one of his business executives [[Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn]] from [[Atlantic Records]], the record company co-founded by Nesuhi's brother and also soccer enthusiast [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]]. The two brothers worked for Ross in the early 1970s after Atlantic got bought in 1967 by [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] that in turn got bought by Ross's [[Kinney National Company]] two years later. When Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn had a business opportunity that would require leaving the company, Ross offered anything in an attempt to keep him. Erteg\u00fcn expressed a desire to have a soccer club created and Ross, a fan of sports in general, obliged. Following [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Mexico]], the event that Erteg\u00fcns used to further establish contacts in the soccer world by throwing lavish parties one of which was attended by Pel\u00e9, the brothers came back to New York and held Ross to his promise so he and longtime associate Jay Emmett called and convinced eight other executives to contribute $35,000 each towards establishing a new soccer franchise that would compete in the struggling [[North American Soccer League]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Newsham|first=Gavin |date=2007 |title=Once in a Lifetime: The Incredible Story of the New York Cosmos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zusmrbrHmdUC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=steve+ross+nasl+founding&source=bl&ots=sJLIAkqC08&sig=lkIwCSuYP_8IrIjMVpi-4lvkol0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9CPyU-3QOJD9yQTq9IKQDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=steve%20ross%20nasl%20founding&f=false|location= |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |page= |isbn=9781555848699 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Founding the New York Cosmos===\nThe franchise called the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]] was created in early 1971 with Englishman [[Clive Toye]] as its first general manager and 37-year-old [[Gordon Bradley]] as the player/coach. Playing out their [[1971 North American Soccer League season|debut season]] in almost empty stadiums with virtually no media coverage, the Cosmos were a rag-tag semi-professional operation, but most importantly Ross was hooked and very much interested to see the team do well. Scared of losing money, the ten original investors sold their stake in the franchise to newly created Warner Communications (the company where Ross was CEO and chairman) for $1. Essentially, with the sale, Ross added the modest franchise to the vast media empire he was in charge of running.\n\n===Bringing Pel\u00e9 to America===\nFollowing the first few seasons in obscurity, Ross decided that signing a big marquee name was the way forward to achieving greater prominence and ultimately securing the league's long-term dream\u2014a network television deal.\n\nThe idea of bringing Pel\u00e9 to America had actually been around for a while as NASL commissioner [[Phil Woosnam]] and eventual Cosmos GM Clive Toye discussed it as far back as 1970 and even made an approach to the player in spring 1971, one month after the Cosmos had been formed. However, in 1975 with Ross willing to spend the big money, conditions were finally there to make the dream transfer happen. He sent Emmett, Toye, Cosmos vice-president Raphael de la Sierra, and Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn to Brazil where they met with 34-year-old Pel\u00e9 at a seaside resort and played soccer with him on the beach. Since by this time [[Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus]] also started sniffing around Pel\u00e9 in an attempt to bring him to Europe for the first time, the Cosmos delegation used the possibility of making soccer big in a country new to the sport as their main lure and by the end of the day, the Brazilian agreed in principle to come to New York. The actual negotiation with Warner Communications lawyer Norman Samnick, who was deployed to Brazil by Ross, turned out to be a little more difficult: Ross was willing to risk $2 million for three years of play while Pel\u00e9 demanded $5 million for two years. In the end, the deal agreed was a complex five-part contract worth around $4.5 million in total that included $1 million for three years of play, $1 million for ten years of marketing rights, $1 million for a fourteen-year PR contract, and another $1 million for a music contract. Warner Communications money thus managed to lure arguably then still the biggest name in soccer out of retirement. In addition to huge amounts of money, due to Pel\u00e9's special status in Brazil as the country's national treasure, getting him to leave his homeland for the first time in his career involved a lot of politics as well, especially when the Brazilian president demanded that Pel\u00e9 play another year in Brazil for the \"good of his people\". Ross called on his political connections in an attempt to soften the Brazilian government's position and eventually managed to get to the US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], who personally called his Brazilian counterpart telling him that Pel\u00e9's move to New York would be a huge step forward in the [[Brazil \u2013 United States relations|US\u2013Brazil relations]].\n\nPel\u00e9's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the USA. From the moment he signed his contract at the [[21 Club]] on 10 June 1975 in front of ecstatic Ross and a crush of worldwide media, the player's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to the sport in America.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/sports/soccer-pele-in-town-is-still-making-right-moves.html |title= SOCCER; Pele, in Town, Is Still Making Right Moves|author=Alex Yannis |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = April 25, 1991 }}</ref> His debut NASL match five days later versus [[Dallas Tornado]] at the dilapidated [[Downing Stadium]] on [[Randall's Island]] was broadcast live on [[CBS]] network. It was the Cosmos tenth match of the [[1975 North American Soccer League season|season]] and led by the Brazilian, who recorded an assist and a goal, they managed to come back from two goals down for the 2\u20132 final score. The contest was also Pel\u00e9's first competitive match in eight months since his last outing with [[Santos FC]] in October 1974. He would eventually end up with 5 goals in his debut season during which his biggest challenge became figuring out how to fit into this team of journeymen players with abilities far inferior to his. Still his biggest impact was on the sport in New York and the rest of America as Cosmos' home attendance got tripled in just half the season he was there. They also played in front of huge crowds on the road since everyone wanted to see Pel\u00e9 - towards the end of the season when he pulled a hamstring and couldn't suit up, 20,000 fans in Philadelphia showed up just to see him in street clothes. Furthermore, the league's profile got raised as other NASL teams - encouraged by Ross' investment in Pel\u00e9 and the prominence his arrival brought to the Cosmos franchise - started bringing over more big-name aging foreign stars such as [[George Best]] who was about to turn 30, 31-year-old [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], 34-year-old [[Geoff Hurst]], and 35-year-old [[Bobby Moore]].\n\n===More big names arrive in New York===\nSince the Cosmos failed to make the playoffs in Pel\u00e9's debut season, for the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|next season]], Ross decided to complement his superstar with more prominent names from overseas, the biggest of which was 29-year-old temperamental Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia from [[S.S. Lazio]]. The striker became an undeniable goal-scoring hit on the pitch with 19 goals in 19 league appearances that season, but his style of play as well as his egotistical and arrogant manner also got him many detractors both within and outside of the club. However, he endeared himself to Ross as the two soon became very close friends. Due to increased interest, the team moved to Yankee Stadium. Though the Brazilian midfield organizer and the Italian striker quickly developed an uneasy relationship, thanks to their assists and goals, respectively, the club managed to make the playoffs, losing to underdogs [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] led by Rodney Marsh in the conference semifinal series 3 games to 1. Pel\u00e9 still got the league MVP honors and Chinaglia became the league's top goalscorer. Though furious over the early playoff exit, Ross immediately took the team on an exhibition summer tour of Europe with stops to play friendly games in England, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. Though hugely expensive, the tour generated plenty of publicity for Warner Communications.\n\nThe [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977 NASL season]]\u2014Pel\u00e9's final season before retirement\u2014began at the newly built [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey as New York Cosmos dropped \"New York\" from its name to become just the Cosmos. With the new giant home, Ross decided to Americanize the experience of going to a Cosmos game with cheerleaders, halftime show, and mascots. On the field, however, the squad got internationalized even further with a roster that had players from every corner of the world. Attendance rose slightly to just over 20,000 in the first five games (3 of which Cosmos lost), but still not enough to Ross' liking. In search of more people in the seats, Ross decided to raise the bar again. He reached for the chequebook midway through the season and looked oversees for more big stars, singing 31-year-old German superstar Franz Beckenbauer from [[Bayern Munich]] in May 1977. The German's debut was a 4-2 loss away at Tampa while the following week Cosmos beat Toronto at home in front of 31,000 fans. Ross was happy with the attendance increase, but wanted even more and to that end enlisted celebrities that did business with Warner Communications to make publicized appearances at Cosmos home games. People like [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Steven Spielberg]], etc. became a regular sight in the Cosmos locker room and in the luxury boxes at the Giants Stadium. Other changes were in order too as general manager Toye and head coach Bradley got fired and Tampa Bay's [[Eddie Firmani]] became the new coach. The team's striker Chinaglia was said to be the driving influence on Ross to hire Chinaglia's good friend Firmani as Chinaglia and Ross developed a personal relationship. Chinaglia thrived under Firmani, scoring goals one after another. The team's play as well as the attendance also started to pick up - led by Pele's hat-trick, the Cosmos finally managed to avenge the losses to Tampa Bay by beating them at home in front 62,394 fans. However, this was followed by another inexplicable dip in form with five losses in seven games. Ross reacted immediately, throwing more big money into the squad, signing Brazil national team's former inspirational captain defender Carlos Alberto who was about to turn 33 years of age. He joined the squad with only four games remaining in the 1977 regular season. By this time, the attendance was rising sharply as the team as well as the league started to catch major buzz. The summer of 1977 was the franchise's first true foray into big time: on 14 August, the Giants Stadium was sold out for the Cosmos first game of the playoffs against [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977\u20131983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] with 77,691 people in the stands. The Cosmos finally won the title defeating [[Seattle Sounders (1974\u20131983)|Seattle Sounders]] in the Soccer Bowl during late August as Beckenbauer became league MVP and Pel\u00e9 retired in style.\n\n===Heading US bid to host the 1986 FIFA World Cup===\nIn November 1982, when [[Colombia]], the originally selected [[FIFA World Cup hosts|host]] of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], gave up on organizing the event, for economic reasons, Ross called upon all his soccer connections and campaigned hard to bring the tournament to the US including meeting with FIFA president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]], but in May 1983 [[FIFA]] decided on [[Mexico]] as the replacement host.<ref name=Cosmos>{{cite web |url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/reviewsnews.php?id=15251|publisher= Douglas, Edward.

It is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If {{math|''m''}} is an object's mass and {{math|'''v'''}} is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum is:<br>\n<math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.</math><br>\nIn [[International System of Units|SI units]], momentum is measured in [[kilogram metre per second|kilogram meters per second]] ([[kilogram|kg]]\u22c5[[meters per second|m/s]]).\n\n[[Newton's second law]] of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. Momentum depends on the [[frame of reference]], but in any inertial frame it is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in [[special relativity]] (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form,  in [[electrodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and [[general relativity]]. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: [[translational symmetry]].\n\nAdvanced formulations of classical mechanics, [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is  ''generalized momentum'', and in general this is different from the ''kinetic'' momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a [[wave function]]. The momentum and position operators are related by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].\n\nIn continuous systems such as [[electromagnetic field]]s, [[fluid dynamics]] and [[deformable bodies]], a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for fluids or the [[Cauchy momentum equation]] for deformable solids or fluids.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Newtonian==\nMomentum is a [[vector quantity]]: it has both magnitude and direction. Since momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction and speed of motion of objects after they collide. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see [[Momentum#Multiple dimensions|multiple dimensions]]).\n\n===Single particle===\nThe momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter {{math|''p''}}. It is the product of two quantities, the particle's [[mass]] (represented by the letter {{math|''m''}}) and its [[velocity]] ({{math|''v''}}):<ref name=FeynmanCh9>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 9}}</ref>\n:<math>p = m v. </math>\n\nThe unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In [[SI units]], if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second (kg\u22c5m/s). In [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|cgs units]], if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second (g\u22c5cm/s).\n\nBeing a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1&nbsp;kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1&nbsp;m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.\n\n===Many particles===\nThe momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}, and velocities {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, the total momentum is\n:<math> \\begin{align} p &= p_1 + p_2 \\\\\n&= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\,. \\end{align} </math>\nThe momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:\n:<math> p = \\sum_{i} m_i v_i .</math>\n\nA system of particles has a [[center of mass]], a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:\n:<math> r_\\text{cm} = \\frac{m_1 r_1 + m_2 r_2 + \\cdots}{m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_ir_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_i}.</math>\n\nIf one or more of the particles is moving, the center of mass of the system will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the total mass of the particles is <math>m</math>, and the center of mass is moving at velocity {{math|''v''<sub>cm</sub>}}, the momentum of the system is:\n:<math>p= mv_\\text{cm}.</math>\nThis is known as [[Euler's laws of motion|Euler's first law]].<ref name=\"BookRags\">{{cite book\n |url         = http://www.bookrags.com/research/eulers-laws-of-motion-wom/\n |title       = Euler's Laws of Motion\n |accessdate  = 2009-03-30\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090710162552/http://www.bookrags.com/research/eulers-laws-of-motion-wom/\n |archivedate = 2009-07-10\n |df          =\n}}</ref><ref name=\"McGillKing\">{{cite book\n|title=Engineering Mechanics, An Introduction to Dynamics\n|edition=3rd\n|last=McGill and King\n|publisher=PWS Publishing Company\n|date=1995\n|isbn=978-0-534-93399-9}}</ref>\n\n===Relation to force===\n\nIf the net force {{math|''F''}} applied to a particle is constant, and is applied for a time interval {{math|\u0394''t''}}, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount\n:<math>\\Delta p = F \\Delta t\\,.</math>\n\nIn differential form, this is [[Newton's second law]]; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the instantaneous force {{math|''F''}} acting on it,<ref name=FeynmanCh9/>\n:<math>F = \\frac{dp }{d t}. </math>\n\nIf the net force experienced by a particle changes as a function of time, {{math|''F(t)''}}, the change in momentum (or [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] {{math|''J'' }}) between times {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}  is\n:<math> \\Delta p = J = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t)\\, dt\\,.</math>\n\nImpulse is measured in the [[SI derived unit|derived units]] of the [[newton second]] (1&nbsp;N\u22c5s = 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s) or [[dyne]] second (1 dyne\u22c5s = 1 g\u22c5cm/s)\n\nUnder the assumption of constant mass {{math|''m''}}, it is equivalent to write\n:<math>F = \\frac{d(mv)}{d t} = m\\frac{dv}{d t} = m a,</math>\nhence the net force is equal to the mass of the particle times its [[acceleration]].<ref name=FeynmanCh9/>\n\n''Example'': A model airplane of mass 1&nbsp;kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6&nbsp;m/s due north in 2&nbsp;s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|newtons]] due north. The change in momentum is 6&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s due north. The rate of change of momentum is 3&nbsp;(kg\u22c5m/s)/s due north which is numerically equivalent to 3&nbsp;newtons.\n\n===Conservation===\nIn a [[closed system]] (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum is constant. This fact, known as the ''law of conservation of momentum'', is implied by [[Newton's laws of motion]].<ref name=FeynmanCh10>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Invitation to Contemporary Physics |url=https://archive.org/details/invitationtocont00hoki |url-access=registration |edition=illustrated |first1=Quang |last1=Ho-Kim |first2=Narendra |last2=Kumar |first3=Harry C.S. |last3= Lam |publisher=World Scientific |year=2004 |isbn=978-981-238-303-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/invitationtocont00hoki/page/19 19] }}</ref> Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that {{math|''F''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>1</sub>|''dt''}}}} and {{math|''F''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>2</sub>|''dt''}}}}. Therefore,\n:<math> \\frac{d p_1}{d t} = - \\frac{d p_2}{d t}, </math>\nwith the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{d}{d t} \\left(p_1+ p_2\\right)= 0. </math>\n\nIf the velocities of the particles are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the interaction, and afterwards they are {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, then\n:<math>m_1 u_{1} + m_2 u_{2} = m_1 v_{1} + m_2 v_{2}.</math>\n\nThis law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including [[collision]]s and separations caused by explosive forces.<ref name=FeynmanCh10/> It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the [[theory of relativity]] and in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]].<ref name=Goldstein54/>\n\n===Dependence on reference frame===\n[[File:Relativity an apple in a lift.svg|thumb|Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.]]\nMomentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a [[frame of reference]], in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.\n\nSuppose a particle has position {{math|''x''}} in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed {{math|''u''}}, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as\n:<math> x' = x - ut\\,.</math>\nThis is called a [[Galilean transformation]]. If the particle is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''dx''|''dt''}} {{=}} ''v''}} in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed\n:<math> v' = \\frac{dx'}{dt} = v-u\\,.</math>\nSince {{math|''u''}} does not change, the accelerations are the same:\n:<math> a' = \\frac{dv'}{dt} = a\\,.</math>\nThus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or [[Galilean invariance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=276}}</ref>\n\nA change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the [[center of mass frame]] \u2013 one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,\nthe total momentum is zero.\n\n===Application to collisions===\nBy itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, [[kinetic energy]], must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an ''[[elastic collision]]''; if not, it is an ''[[inelastic collision]]''.\n\n====Elastic collisions====\n{{Main|Elastic collision}}\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of equal masses]]\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df3.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of unequal masses]]\nAn elastic collision is one in which no [[kinetic energy]] is absorbed in the collision. Perfectly elastic \"collisions\" can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A [[gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two [[Pool billiards|pool]] balls is a good example of an ''almost'' totally elastic collision, due to their high [[stiffness|rigidity]], but when bodies come in contact there is always some [[dissipation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |title=Elastic and inelastic collisions |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818114930/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |archivedate=18 August 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nA head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the collision and {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}} after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 &= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\\\\n\\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 &= \\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2\\,.\\end{align}</math>\n\nA change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass {{math|''m''}}, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed {{math|''v''}} (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}} and both bodies are moving towards it at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}}. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed {{math|''v''}}. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by<ref name=FeynmanCh10/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}  v_1 &= u_2\\\\\nv_2 &= u_1\\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\nIn general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by<ref>{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|author2=John W.

In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:<ref>{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Peter M.|title=Biomechanics of sport and exercise|date=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL [u.a.]|isbn=9780736051019|page=85|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819020542/https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}</ref>\n:<math>C_\\text{R} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{bounce height}}{\\text{drop height}}}\\,.</math>\n\nThe momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an [[explosion]] is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. [[Rocket]]s also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple dimensions===\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df 2D.gif|thumb|right|Two-dimensional elastic collision.

In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: {{math|''m''(''t'')}}. The momentum of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is therefore {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} ''m''(''t'')''v''(''t'')}}. One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force {{math|''F''}} on the object is related to its momentum {{math|''p''(''t'')}} by {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''(''mv'')|''dt''}}}}:<ref name=\"kleppner135\">{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|last2=Kolenkow|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|pages=135\u201339}}</ref>\n\n:<math> F = m(t) \\frac{dv}{dt} + v(t) \\frac{dm}{dt}.</math> (incorrect){{Why|reason=It is not shown why the derivation is incorrect.|date=May 2019}}\nThis equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects.

It also results in a prediction that the [[speed of light]] can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the [[special theory of relativity]], Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the [[Lorentz transformation]] instead of the [[Galilean transformation]].<ref name=RindlerCh2>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nConsider, for example, one reference frame moving relative to another at velocity {{math|''v''}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction.

These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example {{math|'''R'''}} for position. The expression for the ''four-momentum'' depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of [[proper time]], {{math|''\u03c4''}}, defined by<ref>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|p=66}}</ref>\n:<math>c^2d\\tau^2 = c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2\\,,</math>\nis [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the {{nowrap|(+ \u2212 \u2212 \u2212)}} [[metric signature]] has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as [[Euclidean vector]]s and multiplying time by [[Imaginary unit|{{math|{{sqrt|\u22121}}}}]]; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a [[Minkowski space]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Misner|first=Charles W.|author2=Kip S.

Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to {{math|''\u03c1''{{sfrac|''D'''''v'''|''Dt''}}}}. This is equal to the net force on the droplet.\n\nForces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a [[shear stress]] {{math|''\u03c4''}}, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or [[strain rate]]. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the {{math|''x''}} direction varies with {{math|''z''}}, the  tangential force in direction {{math|''x''}} per unit area normal to the {{math|''z''}} direction is\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{zx} = -\\mu\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial z}\\,,</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[viscosity]].

Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air.  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (also known by his Latinized name [[Avicenna]]) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in ''The Book of Healing'' in 1020.

It is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If {{math|''m''}} is an object's mass and {{math|'''v'''}} is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum is:<br>\n<math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.</math><br>\nIn [[International System of Units|SI units]], momentum is measured in [[kilogram metre per second|kilogram meters per second]] ([[kilogram|kg]]\u22c5[[meters per second|m/s]]).\n\n[[Newton's second law]] of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. Momentum depends on the [[frame of reference]], but in any inertial frame it is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in [[special relativity]] (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form,  in [[electrodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and [[general relativity]]. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: [[translational symmetry]].\n\nAdvanced formulations of classical mechanics, [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is  ''generalized momentum'', and in general this is different from the ''kinetic'' momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a [[wave function]]. The momentum and position operators are related by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].\n\nIn continuous systems such as [[electromagnetic field]]s, [[fluid dynamics]] and [[deformable bodies]], a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for fluids or the [[Cauchy momentum equation]] for deformable solids or fluids.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Newtonian==\nMomentum is a [[vector quantity]]: it has both magnitude and direction. Since momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction and speed of motion of objects after they collide. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see [[Momentum#Multiple dimensions|multiple dimensions]]).\n\n===Single particle===\nThe momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter {{math|''p''}}. It is the product of two quantities, the particle's [[mass]] (represented by the letter {{math|''m''}}) and its [[velocity]] ({{math|''v''}}):<ref name=FeynmanCh9>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 9}}</ref>\n:<math>p = m v. </math>\n\nThe unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In [[SI units]], if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second (kg\u22c5m/s). In [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|cgs units]], if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second (g\u22c5cm/s).\n\nBeing a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1&nbsp;kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1&nbsp;m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.\n\n===Many particles===\nThe momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}, and velocities {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, the total momentum is\n:<math> \\begin{align} p &= p_1 + p_2 \\\\\n&= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\,. \\end{align} </math>\nThe momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:\n:<math> p = \\sum_{i} m_i v_i .</math>\n\nA system of particles has a [[center of mass]], a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:\n:<math> r_\\text{cm} = \\frac{m_1 r_1 + m_2 r_2 + \\cdots}{m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_ir_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_i}.</math>\n\nIf one or more of the particles is moving, the center of mass of the system will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it).

Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that {{math|''F''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>1</sub>|''dt''}}}} and {{math|''F''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>2</sub>|''dt''}}}}. Therefore,\n:<math> \\frac{d p_1}{d t} = - \\frac{d p_2}{d t}, </math>\nwith the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{d}{d t} \\left(p_1+ p_2\\right)= 0. </math>\n\nIf the velocities of the particles are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the interaction, and afterwards they are {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, then\n:<math>m_1 u_{1} + m_2 u_{2} = m_1 v_{1} + m_2 v_{2}.</math>\n\nThis law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including [[collision]]s and separations caused by explosive forces.<ref name=FeynmanCh10/> It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the [[theory of relativity]] and in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]].<ref name=Goldstein54/>\n\n===Dependence on reference frame===\n[[File:Relativity an apple in a lift.svg|thumb|Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.]]\nMomentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a [[frame of reference]], in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.\n\nSuppose a particle has position {{math|''x''}} in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed {{math|''u''}}, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as\n:<math> x' = x - ut\\,.</math>\nThis is called a [[Galilean transformation]]. If the particle is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''dx''|''dt''}} {{=}} ''v''}} in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed\n:<math> v' = \\frac{dx'}{dt} = v-u\\,.</math>\nSince {{math|''u''}} does not change, the accelerations are the same:\n:<math> a' = \\frac{dv'}{dt} = a\\,.</math>\nThus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or [[Galilean invariance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=276}}</ref>\n\nA change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the [[center of mass frame]] \u2013 one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,\nthe total momentum is zero.\n\n===Application to collisions===\nBy itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, [[kinetic energy]], must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an ''[[elastic collision]]''; if not, it is an ''[[inelastic collision]]''.\n\n====Elastic collisions====\n{{Main|Elastic collision}}\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of equal masses]]\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df3.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of unequal masses]]\nAn elastic collision is one in which no [[kinetic energy]] is absorbed in the collision. Perfectly elastic \"collisions\" can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A [[gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two [[Pool billiards|pool]] balls is a good example of an ''almost'' totally elastic collision, due to their high [[stiffness|rigidity]], but when bodies come in contact there is always some [[dissipation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |title=Elastic and inelastic collisions |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818114930/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |archivedate=18 August 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nA head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the collision and {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}} after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 &= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\\\\n\\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 &= \\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2\\,.\\end{align}</math>\n\nA change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass {{math|''m''}}, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed {{math|''v''}} (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}} and both bodies are moving towards it at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}}. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed {{math|''v''}}. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by<ref name=FeynmanCh10/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}  v_1 &= u_2\\\\\nv_2 &= u_1\\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\nIn general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by<ref>{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|author2=John W.

In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:<ref>{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Peter M.|title=Biomechanics of sport and exercise|date=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL [u.a.]|isbn=9780736051019|page=85|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819020542/https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}</ref>\n:<math>C_\\text{R} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{bounce height}}{\\text{drop height}}}\\,.</math>\n\nThe momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an [[explosion]] is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. [[Rocket]]s also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple dimensions===\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df 2D.gif|thumb|right|Two-dimensional elastic collision.

In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: {{math|''m''(''t'')}}. The momentum of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is therefore {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} ''m''(''t'')''v''(''t'')}}. One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force {{math|''F''}} on the object is related to its momentum {{math|''p''(''t'')}} by {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''(''mv'')|''dt''}}}}:<ref name=\"kleppner135\">{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|last2=Kolenkow|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|pages=135\u201339}}</ref>\n\n:<math> F = m(t) \\frac{dv}{dt} + v(t) \\frac{dm}{dt}.</math> (incorrect){{Why|reason=It is not shown why the derivation is incorrect.|date=May 2019}}\nThis equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is\n:<math> F = m(t) \\frac{dv}{dt} - u \\frac{dm}{dt},</math>\nwhere {{math|''u''}} is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass ''as seen in the object's rest frame''.<ref name=\"kleppner135\" /> This is distinct from {{math|''v''}}, which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.\n\nThis equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (''dm''). When considered together, the object and the mass (''dm'') constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.\n\n:<math> P(t+dt) = ( m - dm ) ( v + dv ) + dm ( v - u ) = mv+m dv - u dm = P(t) +m dv - u dm </math>\n\n==Relativistic==\n{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}\n\n===Lorentz invariance===\nNewtonian physics assumes that [[absolute time and space]] exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to [[Galilean invariance]]. It also results in a prediction that the [[speed of light]] can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the [[special theory of relativity]], Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the [[Lorentz transformation]] instead of the [[Galilean transformation]].<ref name=RindlerCh2>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nConsider, for example, one reference frame moving relative to another at velocity {{math|''v''}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction.

These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example {{math|'''R'''}} for position. The expression for the ''four-momentum'' depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of [[proper time]], {{math|''\u03c4''}}, defined by<ref>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|p=66}}</ref>\n:<math>c^2d\\tau^2 = c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2\\,,</math>\nis [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the {{nowrap|(+ \u2212 \u2212 \u2212)}} [[metric signature]] has been used, different authors use different conventions).

Instead, the materials must be approximated by a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] in which there is a particle or [[fluid parcel]] at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density {{math|''\u03c1''}} and velocity {{math|'''v'''}} that depend on time {{math|''t''}} and position {{math|'''r'''}}. The momentum per unit volume is {{math|''\u03c1'''''v'''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=48\u201351}}</ref>\n\nConsider a column of water in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is {{math|''\u03c1'''''g'''}}, where {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the [[pressure]] {{math|''p''}}. The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is<ref name=FeynmanCh40>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 2|loc=Chapter 40}}</ref>\n:<math>-\\nabla p +\\rho \\mathbf{g} = 0\\,.</math>\n\nIf the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative {{math|{{sfrac|''\u2202'''''v'''|''\u2202t''}}}} because the fluid in a given volume changes with time. Instead, the [[material derivative]] is needed:<ref>{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=54}}</ref>\n:<math>\\frac{D}{Dt} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}  + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\,.</math>\nApplied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to [[advection]] as fluid is carried past the point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to {{math|''\u03c1''{{sfrac|''D'''''v'''|''Dt''}}}}. This is equal to the net force on the droplet.\n\nForces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a [[shear stress]] {{math|''\u03c4''}}, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or [[strain rate]]. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the {{math|''x''}} direction varies with {{math|''z''}}, the  tangential force in direction {{math|''x''}} per unit area normal to the {{math|''z''}} direction is\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{zx} = -\\mu\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial z}\\,,</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[viscosity]].

The nine components make up the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] {{math|'''\u03c3'''}}, which includes both pressure and shear.

Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air.  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (also known by his Latinized name [[Avicenna]]) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in ''The Book of Healing'' in 1020.
