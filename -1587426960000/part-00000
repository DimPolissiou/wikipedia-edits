Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the [[body text]] or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of a [[web page]]. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps in response to user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as \"black-hat SEO\". These methods are more focused on breaking the search-engine-promotion rules and guidelines. In addition to this, the perpetrators run the risk of their websites being severely penalized by the [[Google Panda]] and [[Google Penguin]] search-results ranking algorithms.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Smarty |title=What Is BlackHat SEO? 5 Definitions |url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-blackhat-seo-5-definitions/8151/ |work=Search Engine Journal |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nCommon spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: ''content spam''<ref name=\"Ntoulas\"/> (or ''term spam'') and ''link spam''.<ref name=Gyongyi/>\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known reference<ref name=\"wspy\"/> to the term ''spamdexing'' is by Eric Convey in his article \"Porn sneaks way back on Web,\" [[The Boston Herald]], May 22, 1996, where he said:\n\n<blockquote>The problem arises when site operators load their Web pages with hundreds of extraneous terms so search engines will list them among legitimate addresses.\nThe process is called \"spamdexing,\" a combination of [[spamming]] \u2014 the Internet term for sending users unsolicited information \u2014 and \"[[Web indexing|indexing]].\"<ref name=wspy/></blockquote>\n\n==Content spam==\nThese techniques involve altering the logical view that a search engine has over the page's contents. They all aim at variants of the [[vector space model]] for information retrieval on text collections.\n\n===Keyword stuffing===\nKeyword stuffing involves the calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is useful to make a page appear to be relevant for a [[web crawler]] in a way that makes it more likely to be found. Example: A promoter of a [[Ponzi scheme]] wants to attract web surfers to a site where he advertises his scam. He places hidden text appropriate for a fan page of a popular music group on his page, hoping that the page will be listed as a fan site and receive many visits from music lovers. Older versions of indexing programs simply counted how often a keyword appeared, and used that to determine relevance levels. Most modern search engines have the ability to analyze a page for keyword stuffing and determine whether the frequency is consistent with other sites created specifically to attract search engine traffic. Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage.{{cn|date=December 2019}} (However, spammers can circumvent this webpage-size limitation merely by setting up multiple webpages, either independently or linked to each other.)\n  \n=== Hidden or invisible text ===\nUnrelated [[hidden text]] is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within [[HTML]] code such as \"no frame\" sections, [[alt attribute]]s, zero-sized [[Span and div|DIVs]], and \"no script\" sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance [[web accessibility|accessibility]].\n\n===Meta-tag stuffing===\nThis involves repeating keywords in the [[meta tag]]s, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This tactic has been ineffective since 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Doorway pages===\n\"Gateway\" or [[doorway page]]s are low-quality web pages created with very little content, but are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have \"click here to enter\" on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer [[BMW]] for using \"doorway pages\" to the company's German site, BMW.de.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Segal |title=The Dirty Little Secrets of Search |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The NY Times]] |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2012-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Scraper sites===\n[[Scraper sites]] are created using various programs designed to \"scrape\" search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create \"content\" for a website.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as [[pay per click|pay-per-click]] ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.\n\n===Article spinning===\n[[Article spinning]] involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for [[duplicate content]]. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a [[thesaurus]] database or a [[neural network]].\n\n===Machine translation===\nSimilarly to [[article spinning]], some sites use machine translation to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.\n \n===Pages with no information related to page title===\n{{Confusing|section|date=July 2014}}\nPublishing web pages that contain information that is unrelated to the title is a misleading practice known as deception. Despite being a target for penalties from the leading search engines that rank pages, deception is a common practice in some types of sites, including dictionary and encyclopedia sites.\n\n==Link spam==\n'''Link spam''' is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons\nother than merit.<ref name=Davison>{{Citation\n  | first=Brian | last=Davison | author-link=Brian D.

These are also known facetiously as ''mutual admiration societies''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is141/f05/lectures/se-course-intro.pdf|title=Search Engines:Technology, Society, and Business - Marti Hearst, Aug 29, 2005|author=|date=|website=berkeley.edu}}</ref> Use of links farms has been greatly reduced after Google launched the first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.\n\n=== Private blog networks ===\nBlog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or [[Domain name auction|auction domains]] that have [[backlink]]s from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000|title=Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Hidden links===\nPutting [[hyperlink]]s where visitors will not see them to increase [[link popularity]]. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n===Sybil attack===\nA [[Sybil attack]] is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous [[multiple personality disorder]] patient \"[[Sybil (Schreiber book)|Sybil]]\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different [[domain name]]s that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as [[spam blogs]]).\n\n===Spam blogs===\n{{main|Spam blog}}\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written and barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n===Guest blog spam===\n\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/|title=The decay and fall of guest blogging for SEO|author=|date=20 January 2014|website=mattcutts.com}}</ref>\n\n===Buying expired domains===\n{{See also|Domaining}}\nIm Tabatha whittenurg. I have not given anybody permission to do any thing with any apps web sites. My phone's been hacked  \n   \n<br />\n\n===Cookie stuffing===\n[[Cookie stuffing]] involves placing an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] tracking cookie on a website visitor's computer without their knowledge, which will then generate revenue for the person doing the cookie stuffing. This not only generates fraudulent affiliate sales, but also has the potential to overwrite other affiliates' cookies, essentially stealing their legitimately earned commissions.\n\n=== Using world-writable pages ===\n{{main|Forum spam}}\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\n\nAutomated [[spambot]]s can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated [[Forum spam#Spam prevention|spam prevention techniques]] to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n====Spam in blogs====\n{{main|Spam in blogs}}\n[[Spam in blogs]] is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n====Comment spam====\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as [[wikis]], [[blogs]], and [[guestbooks]]. It can be problematic because [[Software agent|agents]] can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.<ref name=Mishne>{{cite conference\n  | first = Gilad | last = Mishne | authorlink = Gilad Mishne |author2=David Carmel |author3=Ronny Lempel\n  | title = Blocking Blog Spam with Language Model Disagreement\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web\n  | pages= | publisher= | year=2005 | url = http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/mishne.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-24 }}</ref>\n\n====Wiki spam====\nWiki spam is a form of link spam on wiki pages. The spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often unrelated to the wiki page where the link is added.\n\n====Referrer log spamming====\n[[Referrer spam]] takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a [[web page]] (the ''referee''), by following a link from another web page (the ''[[referrer]]''), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some [[website]]s have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a [[Internet bot|robot]] randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some [[Web search engine]]s base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n==== Countermeasures ====\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a nofollow tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's [[PageRank]] system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including [[WordPress|Wordpress]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Mirror websites===\nA [[mirror website|mirror site]] is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]]. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n===URL redirection===\n[[URL redirection]] is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, ''e.g.'', using [[META refresh]] tags, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],  [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Server side redirect]]s. However, [[HTTP 301|301 Redirect]], or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n===Cloaking===\n[[Cloaking]] refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine [[Web crawler|spider]] that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses [[IP delivery]], a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is ''code swapping'', ''i.e.'', optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as ''Sneaky Redirects''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en|title=Sneaky redirects - Search Console Help|author=|date=|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== By search engine maintainer ===\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n=== By search engine user ===\nUsers can craft at search keyword, for example, a keyword preceding \"-\" (minus) will eliminate sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in their domain of URL of the pages from search result. Example, search keyword \"-naver\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"naver\" in their pages and the pages whose domain of URL contains \"naver\".\n\n=== Google Chrome extension ===\n\nGoogle itself launched the [[Google Chrome]] extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\" in 2011 as part of countermeasures against [[content farm]]ing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20161129-personal-blocklist-by-google/|title=Google\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u60aa\u8cea\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u975e\u8868\u793a\uff06\u901a\u5831\u3057\u691c\u7d22\u54c1\u8cea\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3067\u304d\u308bGoogle\u516c\u5f0fChrome\u62e1\u5f35\u6a5f\u80fd\u300cPersonal Blocklist\u300d|author=|date=|website=gigazine.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/googles-personal-blocklist-delete-google-search-results-on-chrome-64757|title=New: Block Sites From Google Results Using Chrome's \"Personal Blocklist\" - Search Engine Land|author=|date=14 February 2011|website=searchengineland.com}}</ref>  As of 2018, the extension only works with the [[Personal Computer|PC]] version of Google Chrome.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Adversarial information retrieval]]\n* [[Index (search engine)]] \u2013 overview of search engine indexing technology\n* [[TrustRank]]\n* [[Web scraping]]\n*[[Microsoft SmartScreen]]\n*[[Windows Defender]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Spamming]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}\nIn [[digital marketing]] and [[online advertising]], '''spamdexing''' (also known as '''search engine spam''', '''search engine poisoning''', '''[[Black hat hacker|black-hat]] [[search engine optimization]] (SEO)''', '''search spam''' or '''web spam''')<ref>[http://searchengineland.com/what-is-search-engine-spam-the-video-edition-15202.php  ''SearchEngineLand'', Danny Sullivan's video explanation of Search Engine Spam, October 2008] .

Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or [[Domain name auction|auction domains]] that have [[backlink]]s from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000|title=Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Hidden links===\nPutting [[hyperlink]]s where visitors will not see them to increase [[link popularity]]. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n===Sybil attack===\nA [[Sybil attack]] is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous [[multiple personality disorder]] patient \"[[Sybil (Schreiber book)|Sybil]]\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different [[domain name]]s that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as [[spam blogs]]).\n\n===Spam blogs===\n{{main|Spam blog}}\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written and barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n===Guest blog spam===\n\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/|title=The decay and fall of guest blogging for SEO|author=|date=20 January 2014|website=mattcutts.com}}</ref>\n\n===Buying expired domains===\n{{See also|Domaining}}\nSome link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is \"dropped\". \n   \nSome of these techniques may be applied for creating a [[Google bomb]] \u2014 that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.\n\n===Cookie stuffing===\n[[Cookie stuffing]] involves placing an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] tracking cookie on a website visitor's computer without their knowledge, which will then generate revenue for the person doing the cookie stuffing. This not only generates fraudulent affiliate sales, but also has the potential to overwrite other affiliates' cookies, essentially stealing their legitimately earned commissions.\n\n=== Using world-writable pages ===\n{{main|Forum spam}}\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\n\nAutomated [[spambot]]s can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated [[Forum spam#Spam prevention|spam prevention techniques]] to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n====Spam in blogs====\n{{main|Spam in blogs}}\n[[Spam in blogs]] is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n====Comment spam====\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as [[wikis]], [[blogs]], and [[guestbooks]]. It can be problematic because [[Software agent|agents]] can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.<ref name=Mishne>{{cite conference\n  | first = Gilad | last = Mishne | authorlink = Gilad Mishne |author2=David Carmel |author3=Ronny Lempel\n  | title = Blocking Blog Spam with Language Model Disagreement\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web\n  | pages= | publisher= | year=2005 | url = http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/mishne.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-24 }}</ref>\n\n====Wiki spam====\nWiki spam is a form of link spam on wiki pages. The spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often unrelated to the wiki page where the link is added.\n\n====Referrer log spamming====\n[[Referrer spam]] takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a [[web page]] (the ''referee''), by following a link from another web page (the ''[[referrer]]''), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some [[website]]s have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a [[Internet bot|robot]] randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some [[Web search engine]]s base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n==== Countermeasures ====\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a nofollow tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's [[PageRank]] system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including [[WordPress|Wordpress]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Mirror websites===\nA [[mirror website|mirror site]] is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]]. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n===URL redirection===\n[[URL redirection]] is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, ''e.g.'', using [[META refresh]] tags, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],  [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Server side redirect]]s. However, [[HTTP 301|301 Redirect]], or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n===Cloaking===\n[[Cloaking]] refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine [[Web crawler|spider]] that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses [[IP delivery]], a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is ''code swapping'', ''i.e.'', optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as ''Sneaky Redirects''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en|title=Sneaky redirects - Search Console Help|author=|date=|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== By search engine maintainer ===\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n=== By search engine user ===\nUsers can craft at search keyword, for example, a keyword preceding \"-\" (minus) will eliminate sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in their domain of URL of the pages from search result. Example, search keyword \"-naver\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"naver\" in their pages and the pages whose domain of URL contains \"naver\".\n\n=== Google Chrome extension ===\n\nGoogle itself launched the [[Google Chrome]] extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\" in 2011 as part of countermeasures against [[content farm]]ing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20161129-personal-blocklist-by-google/|title=Google\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u60aa\u8cea\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u975e\u8868\u793a\uff06\u901a\u5831\u3057\u691c\u7d22\u54c1\u8cea\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3067\u304d\u308bGoogle\u516c\u5f0fChrome\u62e1\u5f35\u6a5f\u80fd\u300cPersonal Blocklist\u300d|author=|date=|website=gigazine.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/googles-personal-blocklist-delete-google-search-results-on-chrome-64757|title=New: Block Sites From Google Results Using Chrome's \"Personal Blocklist\" - Search Engine Land|author=|date=14 February 2011|website=searchengineland.com}}</ref>  As of 2018, the extension only works with the [[Personal Computer|PC]] version of Google Chrome.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Adversarial information retrieval]]\n* [[Index (search engine)]] \u2013 overview of search engine indexing technology\n* [[TrustRank]]\n* [[Web scraping]]\n*[[Microsoft SmartScreen]]\n*[[Windows Defender]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Spamming]]\n", "name_user": "174.250.145.111", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing"}

The standard 4000 series [[CMOS]] IC is the 4071, which includes four independent two-input OR gates. The TTL device is the 7432. There are many offshoots of the original 7432 OR gate, all having the same pinout but different internal architecture, allowing them to operate in different voltage ranges and/or at higher speeds. In addition to the standard 2-input OR gate, 3- and 4-input OR gates are also available. In the CMOS series, these are:\n* 4075: triple 3-input OR gate\n* 4072: dual 4-input OR gate\n\nVariations include:\n* 74LS32: quad 2-input OR gate (low power [[Schottky barrier|Schottky]] version)\n* 74HC32: quad 2-input OR gate (high speed CMOS version) - has lower current consumption/wider voltage range\n* 74AC32: quad 2-input OR gate (advanced CMOS version) - similar to 74HC32, but with significantly faster switching speeds and stronger drive\n* 74LVC32: low voltage CMOS version of the same.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Implementations==\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=700\n|align=center\n|image1=CMOS OR.svg\n|caption1=[[CMOS]] OR gate\n|image2=NMOS OR gate.png\n|caption2=[[NMOS logic|NMOS]] OR gate\n|image3=Transistor OR Gate.png\n|caption3=[[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] OR gate\n|image4=Diode OR Gate.svg\n|caption4=OR gate using [[diode]]s\n}}\n\n\n=== Analytical representation ===\n<math>f(a,b)=a+b-a*b</math> is the analytical representation of OR gate:\n* <math>f(0,0)=0+0-0*0=0</math>\n* <math>f(0,1)=0+1-0*1=1</math>\n* <math>f(1,0)=1+0-1*0=1</math>\n* <math>f(1,1)=1+1-1*1=1</math>\n\n===Alternatives===\n{{further|NAND logic|NOR logic}}\nIf no specific OR gates are available, one can be made from NAND or NOR gates in the configuration shown in the image below.

The farm that surrounded most of the lake was the property of Margaret and John Harrington.  John could not farm the land and moved to the local town of Iron Sides (now Old Chelsea). The family stayed on the farm for many years and eventually moved to old Ottawa.  The property is located near [[Meech Lake]]\u2014where the [[Meech Lake Accord]] was negotiated in 1987\u2014approximately 35 kilometres northwest of [[Ottawa]], in [[Gatineau Park]], amidst the [[Gatineau Hills]] in [[Quebec]]. The property is not open to the public, but the [[Mackenzie King Estate]], the retreat of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] at [[Kingsmere]], is a tourist attraction located 2 kilometres south in the park.\n\n==Description==\nSince 1986, the 5.4-hectare (13-acre) property at Harrington Lake has been managed by the [[National Capital Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/official-residences/harrington-lake-lac-mousseau  |title=Places to Visit - Official Residences - Harrington Lake (Lac Mousseau) |date= |publisher=NCC CCN Canada |access-date=14 November 2015}}</ref> The property includes four recreational buildings; the land, which formerly consisted of cultivated fields, has reverted to secondary forest.\n\nIn addition to the main cottage with its fine view over the lake, the Harrington estate includes the following structures:\n* staff cottage\n* upper guest cottage\n* lower guest cottage\n* boat house and paddleboat dock\n* long dock (located the northeast of the retreat)\n\nThe lake itself and the area around it are referred to as ''Lac Mousseau''. The name ''Harrington'' is thought{{by who|date=July 2019}} to be a misspelling of ''Hetherington'', the name of a family which settled in this area. The French name ''Mousseau'' comes from another early settler to the area, Louis Mousseau, who bought property here in 1867.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rayburn |first=Alan |date=15 March 2001 |title=Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=canada+harrington+lake+Lac+Mousseau.+The+name+Harrington+Hetherington#v=onepage |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=227 |isbn=0802082939}}</ref>\n\nThe retreat is accessed by Chemin de Lac Meech with a gatehouse, staffed by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing Service]], at the driveway of the retreat. The Prime Minister's motorcade accesses Harrington Lake from Ottawa via [[Quebec Autoroute 5]].\n\n==History==\nSeveral families came in the 19th century to settle the Harrington Lake area, including the Harrington and the Mousseau families.  The lake eventually became known as \"Harrington Lake\" in English and \"lac Mousseau\" in French. The Mousseau family had built a farm on the shores of the lake, which remained in the family for several decades. Since the land was not suitable for farming, the lumber industry replaced it as the primary economic activity. In the early 20th century, two Americans,  W. A. Drum and W. L. Donnelly, built a sawmill at Harrington Lake to serve the lumber industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/official-residences/harrington-lake-lac-mousseau|title=Official Residences - Harrington Lake (Lac Mousseau)|publisher=NCC CCN Canada |access-date=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Cameron Macpherson Edwards]], a member of a prominent lumbering family in Ottawa, inherited part of the property from his uncle, Senator [[William Cameron Edwards]] (who had owned [[24 Sussex Drive]]).<ref name=HP/> He recognized the value of the land for recreation, as well as for lumber. He purchased more land around the lake, expanding his total holdings to some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres). He also ordered the demolition of the mill buildings at Harrington Lake, and replaced them with a 16-room cottage that was designed in the Colonial Revival style, very common in the 1920s according to the NCC, but with the addition of large fieldstone chimneys.\n\nIn 1951, the lake and the property (including neighbouring land belonging to William Duncan Herridge and Stanley Healey) were acquired by the [[Monarchy of Canada|King in Right of Canada]] to build up preserves of natural areas around the capital. In 1959, supporters of Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] suggested that he needed a quiet place to go fishing, not too far from Ottawa. Later that year, Harrington Lake was chosen as the site for an official country residence and the buildings were formally designated as a secure residence for Canada\u2019s prime ministers.\n\nDuring the first prime ministership of [[Pierre Trudeau]], his then-wife, [[Margaret Trudeau|Margaret]], added a vegetable garden; according to [[Kim Campbell]]'s autobiography ''[[Time and Chance (book)|Time and Chance]]'', the garden still provided the house with fresh produce at the time of that writing. Campbell was the only Prime Minister to have spent her entire term in office residing at Harrington Lake. Initially, Campbell took up residence at Harrington Lake so that her predecessor, [[Brian Mulroney]], could continue to reside at [[24 Sussex Drive]] until renovations on his new private residence in [[Montreal]] were completed. Once Mulroney vacated 24 Sussex, Campbell had not finished moving to that address before her party was defeated in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chequers]], the retreat of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Camp David]], the retreat of the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Harpsund]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/harrington-lake Harrington Lake webpage]\n* [https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/harrington-lake-renovations-ncc-1.5535502 ''Prime minister's lakeside residence undergoing $8.6M renovation'']\n\n{{ca-residence}}\n\n[[Category:Lakes of Outaouais]]\n[[Category:Canadian federal government buildings]]\n[[Category:Official residences in Canada]]\n[[Category:Prime ministerial residences]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{Infobox Historic building\n|name                    = Harrington Lake<br /><sub>''La r\u00e9sidence du lac Mousseau'' ([[Canadian French|French]])</sub>\n|image                   =\n|caption                 = \n|map_type                =\n|coordinates             = {{Coord|45|33|14|N|75|55|46|W|type:landmark_region:CA-QC|display=inline,title}}\n|location_town           = [[Gatineau]], {{QC}}\n|location_country        = {{CAN}}\n|client                  = Cameron Macpherson Edwards\n|engineer                =\n|construction_start_date = 1925<ref name=HP>{{Cite web | url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=11352 |title = HistoricPlaces.ca - HistoricPlaces.ca}}</ref>\n|date_demolished         =\n|cost                    =\n|structural_system       =\n|owner                   = [[Monarchy of Canada|The Queen in Right of Canada]]\n|landlord                = [[National Capital Commission]]\n|current_tenants         = [[Prime Minister of Canada]]\n|style                   = [[Colonial Revival]] style\n|size                    = 16 room home on 5.4-hectare (13-acre) property \n}}\n{{Infobox body of water\n | name = Lac Mousseau\n | image = \n | caption = \n | image_bathymetry = \n | caption_bathymetry = \n | location = [[Gatineau Park]], [[Quebec]]\n | coords = {{Coord|45|34|10|N|75|57|24|W|type:waterbody_region:CA-QC|display=inline}}\n | type = \n | inflow = \n | outflow = \n | catchment = \n | basin_countries = Canada\n | length = \n | width = \n | area = \n | depth = \n | max-depth = \n | volume = \n | residence_time = \n | shore = \n | elevation = \n | islands = \n | cities = \n}}\n'''Harrington Lake''' ({{lang-fr|La r\u00e9sidence du lac Mousseau}}) is the summer residence and all-season retreat of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], and also the name of the land which surrounds it. The farm that surrounded most of the lake was the property of Margaret and John Harrington.  John could not farm the land and moved to the local town of Iron Sides (now Old Chelsea). The family stayed on the farm for many years and eventually moved to old Ottawa.  The property is located near [[Meech Lake]]\u2014where the [[Meech Lake Accord]] was negotiated in 1987\u2014approximately 35 kilometres northwest of [[Ottawa]], in [[Gatineau Park]], amidst the [[Gatineau Hills]] in [[Quebec]]. The property is not open to the public, but the [[Mackenzie King Estate]], the retreat of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] at [[Kingsmere]], is a tourist attraction located 2 kilometres south in the park.\n\n==Description==\nSince 1986, the 5.4-hectare (13-acre) property at Harrington Lake has been managed by the [[National Capital Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/official-residences/harrington-lake-lac-mousseau  |title=Places to Visit - Official Residences - Harrington Lake (Lac Mousseau) |date= |publisher=NCC CCN Canada |access-date=14 November 2015}}</ref> The property includes four recreational buildings; the land, which formerly consisted of cultivated fields, has reverted to secondary forest.\n\nIn addition to the main cottage with its fine view over the lake, the Harrington estate includes the following structures:\n* staff cottage\n* upper guest cottage\n* lower guest cottage\n* boat house and paddleboat dock\n* long dock (located the northeast of the retreat)\n\nThe lake itself and the area around it are referred to as ''Lac Mousseau''. The name ''Harrington'' is thought{{by who|date=July 2019}} to be a misspelling of ''Hetherington'', the name of a family which settled in this area. The French name ''Mousseau'' comes from another early settler to the area, Louis Mousseau, who bought property here in 1867.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rayburn |first=Alan |date=15 March 2001 |title=Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=canada+harrington+lake+Lac+Mousseau.+The+name+Harrington+Hetherington#v=onepage |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=227 |isbn=0802082939}}</ref>\n\nThe retreat is accessed by Chemin de Lac Meech with a gatehouse, staffed by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing Service]], at the driveway of the retreat. The Prime Minister's motorcade accesses Harrington Lake from Ottawa via [[Quebec Autoroute 5]].\n\n==History==\nSeveral families came in the 19th century to settle the Harrington Lake area, including the Harrington and the Mousseau families.  The lake eventually became known as \"Harrington Lake\" in English and \"lac Mousseau\" in French. The Mousseau family had built a farm on the shores of the lake, which remained in the family for several decades. Since the land was not suitable for farming, the lumber industry replaced it as the primary economic activity. In the early 20th century, two Americans,  W. A. Drum and W. L. Donnelly, built a sawmill at Harrington Lake to serve the lumber industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/official-residences/harrington-lake-lac-mousseau|title=Official Residences - Harrington Lake (Lac Mousseau)|publisher=NCC CCN Canada |access-date=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Cameron Macpherson Edwards]], a member of a prominent lumbering family in Ottawa, inherited part of the property from his uncle, Senator [[William Cameron Edwards]] (who had owned [[24 Sussex Drive]]).<ref name=HP/> He recognized the value of the land for recreation, as well as for lumber. He purchased more land around the lake, expanding his total holdings to some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres). He also ordered the demolition of the mill buildings at Harrington Lake, and replaced them with a 16-room cottage that was designed in the Colonial Revival style, very common in the 1920s according to the NCC, but with the addition of large fieldstone chimneys.\n\nIn 1951, the lake and the property (including neighbouring land belonging to William Duncan Herridge and Stanley Healey) were acquired by the [[Monarchy of Canada|King in Right of Canada]] to build up preserves of natural areas around the capital. In 1959, supporters of Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] suggested that he needed a quiet place to go fishing, not too far from Ottawa. Later that year, Harrington Lake was chosen as the site for an official country residence and the buildings were formally designated as a secure residence for Canada\u2019s prime ministers.\n\nDuring the first prime ministership of [[Pierre Trudeau]], his then-wife, [[Margaret Trudeau|Margaret]], added a vegetable garden; according to [[Kim Campbell]]'s autobiography ''[[Time and Chance (book)|Time and Chance]]'', the garden still provided the house with fresh produce at the time of that writing. Campbell was the only Prime Minister to have spent her entire term in office residing at Harrington Lake. Initially, Campbell took up residence at Harrington Lake so that her predecessor, [[Brian Mulroney]], could continue to reside at [[24 Sussex Drive]] until renovations on his new private residence in [[Montreal]] were completed. Once Mulroney vacated 24 Sussex, Campbell had not finished moving to that address before her party was defeated in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chequers]], the retreat of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Camp David]], the retreat of the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Harpsund]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/harrington-lake Harrington Lake webpage]\n* [https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/harrington-lake-renovations-ncc-1.5535502 ''Prime minister's lakeside residence undergoing $8.6M renovation'']\n\n{{ca-residence}}\n\n[[Category:Lakes of Outaouais]]\n[[Category:Canadian federal government buildings]]\n[[Category:Official residences in Canada]]\n[[Category:Prime ministerial residences]]\n", "name_user": "76.71.51.68", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Improved grammar)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrington_Lake"}

The ethnic communities in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegro]] number some 186,000 and 178,000 people, respectively, while another estimated 146,000 still inhabit the disputed area of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> Smaller minorities exist in [[Serbs in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Serbs of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]], some 36,000 and 39,000 people, respectively.\n\nOutside of the Western Balkans, Serbs are an officially recognized minority in [[Serbs in Romania|Romania]] (18,000), [[Serbs in Hungary|Hungary]] (7,000), [[Serbs in Albania|Albania]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Serbs of Slovakia|Slovakia]]. There is a large diaspora in Western Europe, particularly in [[Serbs in Germany|Germany]], [[Serbs in Austria|Austria]], [[Immigration from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Serbs in France|France]], and [[Swedish Serbs|Sweden]]. Outside Europe, there are significant Serb communities in the [[Serbian American|United States]], [[Serbian Canadians|Canada]], [[Serbian Australian|Australia]], [[South America]] and [[Southern Africa]].\n\n===Diaspora===\n {{Main article|Serb diaspora}}\n[[File:World Map of Serbian Diaspora.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Geographical distribution of the diaspora]]\nThere are over 2 million Serbs in [[diaspora]] throughout the world, although some sources put that figure as high as 4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biz \u2013 Vesti \u2013 Srbi za poslom idu i na kraj sveta|publisher=B92|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|accessdate=2014-04-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213053823/http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The existence of a large diaspora is mainly a consequence of either economic or political ([[coercion]] or expulsions) reasons. There were several waves of Serb emigration:\n\n* The first wave took place since the end of the 19th century and lasted until [[World War II]] and was caused by economic reasons; particularly large numbers of Serbs (mainly from peripheral ethnic areas such as [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]]) emigrated to the United States.\n* The second wave took place after the end of [[World War II]]. At this time, members of royalist [[Chetniks]] and other political opponents of communist regime fled the country mainly going overseas ([[United States]] and [[Australia]]) and, to a lesser degree, [[United Kingdom]].\n* The third wave, and by far the largest wave, was economic emigration started in the 1960s when several Western European countries signed bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia allowing the recruitment of industrial workers to those countries, and lasted until the end of the 1980s. Main destinations were [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Sweden]]. That generation of diaspora is collectively known as ''gastarbajteri'', after German ''[[gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest-worker\"), since most of the emigrants headed for German-speaking countries.\n* Recent emigration took place during the 1990s, and was caused by both political and economic reasons. The [[Yugoslav wars]] caused many Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to leave their countries in the first half of the 1990s. The [[Sanctions against Serbia|economic sanctions]] imposed on Serbia caused an economic collapse with an estimated 300,000 people leaving Serbia during that period, 20% of which had a higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|title=Serbia seeks to fill the '90s brain-drainage gap|publisher=EMG.rs|date=5 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529021627/http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"survey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pregled-rs.com/article.php?pid=208&id=19625&lang=en|title=Survey S&M 1/2003|publisher=Yugoslav Survey}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main article|Serbian language}}\n [[File:Serbo croatian languages2006 02.png|thumb|Linguistic map of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Croatia; Serbian language in yellow]]\n [[File:Vuk Karadzic Kriehuber cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], reformer of modern Serbian language]]\nSerbs speak Serbian, a member of the [[Slavic languages|South Slavic]] group of languages, specifically the Southwestern group.

Serbian given names largely originate from [[Slavic names|Slavic roots]]:\ne.g., [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]], [[Bojan]], [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]], [[Zoran]], [[Dragan]], [[Milan (given name)|Milan]], [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]], [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]], [[Slobodan]], [[Du\u0161an]], [[Milica]], [[Nevena]], [[Vesna (name)|Vesna]], [[Radmila]]. Other names are of Christian origin, originating from the bible ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], through Greek), such as [[Lazar (name)|Lazar]], [[Mihailo]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Ilija (given name)|Ilija]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], [[Ivana]]. Along similar lines of non-Slavic Christian names are [[Greeks|Greek]] ones such as: [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Nikola]], [[Aleksandar]], [[Philip (name)|Filip]], [[\u0110or\u0111e]], [[Andrej]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]], while those of [[Latin]] origin include: [[Marko (given name)|Marko]], [[Anthony (given name)|Antonije]], [[Sr\u0111an]], [[Marina (given name)|Marina]], [[Petar]], [[Paul (name)|Pavle]], [[Natalia (given name)|Natalija]], [[Igor (given name)|Igor]] (through Russian).\n\nMost Serbian surnames are paternal, maternal, occupational or derived from personal traits. It is estimated that over two thirds of all Serbian surnames have the suffix ''[[-i\u0107]]'' (-\u0438\u045b) ({{IPA-sh|it\u0255|}}), a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname [[Petrovi\u0107]] means the \"son of Petar\" (from a male progenitor, the root is extended with possessive ''-ov'' or ''-ev''). Due to limited use of international typewriters and unicode computer encoding, the suffix may be simplified to ''-ic'', historically transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch'' in foreign languages. Other common surname suffixes found among Serbian surnames are ''-<u>ov</u>'', ''-<u>ev</u>'', ''-<u>in</u>'' and ''-<u>ski</u>'' (without ''-i\u0107'') which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov.  Other, less common suffices are ''-alj/olj/elj'', ''-ija'', ''-ica'', ''-ar/ac/an''. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are [[Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Petrovi\u0107]], [[Nikoli\u0107]], [[Markovi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], [[Stojanovi\u0107]], [[Ili\u0107]], [[Stankovi\u0107]], [[Pavlovi\u0107]] and [[Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref name=Politika>{{cite web |author=Tanjug |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |title=Srbija, zemlja Milice i Dragana : Dru\u0161tvo : POLITIKA |publisher=Politika.rs |accessdate=2014-04-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616001236/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main article|Serbian Orthodox Church}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107]] in [[Metohija]], the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century and an [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Church of Saint Sava]], one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world\n| width1    = 180\n| image1    = Pe\u0107ka Patrijar\u0161ija (XIII,XIV vek).JPG\n| width2    = 180\n| image2    = St. Sava Temple.jpg\n}}\n\nSerbs are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]].

The ethnic communities in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegro]] number some 186,000 and 178,000 people, respectively, while another estimated 146,000 still inhabit the disputed area of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> Smaller minorities exist in [[Serbs in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Serbs of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]], some 36,000 and 39,000 people, respectively.\n\nOutside of the Western Balkans, Serbs are an officially recognized minority in [[Serbs in Romania|Romania]] (18,000), [[Serbs in Hungary|Hungary]] (7,000), [[Serbs in Albania|Albania]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Serbs of Slovakia|Slovakia]]. There is a large diaspora in Western Europe, particularly in [[Serbs in Germany|Germany]], [[Serbs in Austria|Austria]], [[Immigration from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Serbs in France|France]], and [[Swedish Serbs|Sweden]]. Outside Europe, there are significant Serb communities in the [[Serbian American|United States]], [[Serbian Canadians|Canada]], [[Serbian Australian|Australia]], [[South America]] and [[Southern Africa]].\n\n===Diaspora===\n {{Main article|Serb diaspora}}\n[[File:World Map of Serbian Diaspora.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Geographical distribution of the diaspora]]\nThere are over 2 million Serbs in [[diaspora]] throughout the world, although some sources put that figure as high as 4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biz \u2013 Vesti \u2013 Srbi za poslom idu i na kraj sveta|publisher=B92|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|accessdate=2014-04-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213053823/http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The existence of a large diaspora is mainly a consequence of either economic or political ([[coercion]] or expulsions) reasons. There were several waves of Serb emigration:\n\n* The first wave took place since the end of the 19th century and lasted until [[World War II]] and was caused by economic reasons; particularly large numbers of Serbs (mainly from peripheral ethnic areas such as [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]]) emigrated to the United States.\n* The second wave took place after the end of [[World War II]]. At this time, members of royalist [[Chetniks]] and other political opponents of communist regime fled the country mainly going overseas ([[United States]] and [[Australia]]) and, to a lesser degree, [[United Kingdom]].\n* The third wave, and by far the largest wave, was economic emigration started in the 1960s when several Western European countries signed bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia allowing the recruitment of industrial workers to those countries, and lasted until the end of the 1980s. Main destinations were [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Sweden]]. That generation of diaspora is collectively known as ''gastarbajteri'', after German ''[[gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest-worker\"), since most of the emigrants headed for German-speaking countries.\n* Recent emigration took place during the 1990s, and was caused by both political and economic reasons. The [[Yugoslav wars]] caused many Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to leave their countries in the first half of the 1990s. The [[Sanctions against Serbia|economic sanctions]] imposed on Serbia caused an economic collapse with an estimated 300,000 people leaving Serbia during that period, 20% of which had a higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|title=Serbia seeks to fill the '90s brain-drainage gap|publisher=EMG.rs|date=5 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529021627/http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"survey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pregled-rs.com/article.php?pid=208&id=19625&lang=en|title=Survey S&M 1/2003|publisher=Yugoslav Survey}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main article|Serbian language}}\n [[File:Serbo croatian languages2006 02.png|thumb|Linguistic map of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Croatia; Serbian language in yellow]]\n [[File:Vuk Karadzic Kriehuber cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], reformer of modern Serbian language]]\nSerbs speak Serbian, a member of the [[Slavic languages|South Slavic]] group of languages, specifically the Southwestern group.

Serbian given names largely originate from [[Slavic names|Slavic roots]]:\ne.g., [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]], [[Bojan]], [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]], [[Zoran]], [[Dragan]], [[Milan (given name)|Milan]], [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]], [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]], [[Slobodan]], [[Du\u0161an]], [[Milica]], [[Nevena]], [[Vesna (name)|Vesna]], [[Radmila]]. Other names are of Christian origin, originating from the bible ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], through Greek), such as [[Lazar (name)|Lazar]], [[Mihailo]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Ilija (given name)|Ilija]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], [[Ivana]]. Along similar lines of non-Slavic Christian names are [[Greeks|Greek]] ones such as: [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Nikola]], [[Aleksandar]], [[Philip (name)|Filip]], [[\u0110or\u0111e]], [[Andrej]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]], while those of [[Latin]] origin include: [[Marko (given name)|Marko]], [[Anthony (given name)|Antonije]], [[Sr\u0111an]], [[Marina (given name)|Marina]], [[Petar]], [[Paul (name)|Pavle]], [[Natalia (given name)|Natalija]], [[Igor (given name)|Igor]] (through Russian).\n\nMost Serbian surnames are paternal, maternal, occupational or derived from personal traits. It is estimated that over two thirds of all Serbian surnames have the suffix ''[[-i\u0107]]'' (-\u0438\u045b) ({{IPA-sh|it\u0255|}}), a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname [[Petrovi\u0107]] means the \"son of Petar\" (from a male progenitor, the root is extended with possessive ''-ov'' or ''-ev''). Due to limited use of international typewriters and unicode computer encoding, the suffix may be simplified to ''-ic'', historically transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch'' in foreign languages. Other common surname suffixes found among Serbian surnames are ''-<u>ov</u>'', ''-<u>ev</u>'', ''-<u>in</u>'' and ''-<u>ski</u>'' (without ''-i\u0107'') which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov.  Other, less common suffices are ''-alj/olj/elj'', ''-ija'', ''-ica'', ''-ar/ac/an''. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are [[Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Petrovi\u0107]], [[Nikoli\u0107]], [[Markovi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], [[Stojanovi\u0107]], [[Ili\u0107]], [[Stankovi\u0107]], [[Pavlovi\u0107]] and [[Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref name=Politika>{{cite web |author=Tanjug |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |title=Srbija, zemlja Milice i Dragana : Dru\u0161tvo : POLITIKA |publisher=Politika.rs |accessdate=2014-04-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616001236/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main article|Serbian Orthodox Church}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107]] in [[Metohija]], the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century and an [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Church of Saint Sava]], one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world\n| width1    = 180\n| image1    = Pe\u0107ka Patrijar\u0161ija (XIII,XIV vek).JPG\n| width2    = 180\n| image2    = St. Sava Temple.jpg\n}}\n\nSerbs are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]].

Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, \"I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.\"<ref name=poetry_foundation/> ''Death of a Naturalist'' (1966) and ''Door into the Dark'' (1969) mostly focus on the details of rural, parochial life.<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\nIn a number of volumes, beginning with ''Door into the Dark'' (1969) and ''Wintering Out'' (1972), Heaney also spent a significant amount of time writing on the northern Irish bog. Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in [[North (poetry collection)|''North'']] (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \"the laureate of violence\u2014a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Donoghue|first1=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=4}}</ref> Poems such as \"Bogland\" and \"Bog Queen\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0LZlAAAAMAAJ |p=5 |title=The body and desire in contemporary Irish poetry |author=Irene Gilsenan Nordin |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2006|isbn=9780716533689 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nAllusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trinity.duke.edu/node/1637 |work=[[Duke University]] |author=Ezgi Ustundag |title=Expressing Humanity During 'The Troubles:' The Poetry of Seamus Heaney}}</ref> His books ''Wintering Out'' (1973) and ''North'' (1975) seek to interweave commentary on [[the Troubles]] with a historical context and wider human experience.<ref name=poetry_foundation>{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/seamus-heaney|title=Biography|work=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, [[Blake Morrison]] suggests the poet <blockquote>has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance...

Politic about politics, ''Station Island'' is less about a united Ireland than about a poet seeking religious and aesthetic unity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://new.bostonreview.net/BR10.1/heaney.html|title=Station Island, Seamus Heaney|date=1 February 1985|accessdate=2 October 2010|first=Shaun|last=O'Connell|work=Boston Review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeaney is described by critic [[Terry Eagleton]] as \"an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n22/terry-eagleton/hasped-and-hooped-and-hirpling |title=Terry Eagleton reviews 'Beowulf' translated by Seamus Heaney \u00b7 ''LRB'' 11 November 1999 |publisher=Lrb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> refusing to be drawn.

[[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] wrote, \"throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/>\n\nHeaney published \"Requiem for the [[Croppy|Croppies]]\", a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798, on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, \"To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say \u2018up the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]\u2019 or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing.\"<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5132022/Interview-with-Seamus-Heaney.html|title=Interview with Seamus Heaney: On the eve of his 70th birthday, Seamus Heaney tells Sameer Rahim about his lifetime in poetry \u2013 and who he thinks would make a good poet laureate|first=Sameer|last=Rahim|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> He stated, \"You don't have to love it.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

Originally entitled ''The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People'' on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of ''The Rattle Bag'' was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \"Arbitrary riches.\" Heaney commented \"the book in our heads was something closer to ''The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.''\"<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment/> It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, ''The School Bag'' aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted \"less of a carnival, more like a checklist.\" It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/25/poetry.highereducation|title=Bags of enlightenment|date=25 October 2003|accessdate=25 October 2003|first=Seamus|last=Heaney|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref> <!--Two of his poems entitled \"Storm on the Island\" and \"Follower\" feature on the new [[GCSE]] English Literature course as part of the anthology poetry cluster.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.
