It is a process of creating and managing [[contracts]] between the owner of a [[brand]] and a company or individual who wants to  use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a [[trademark]] or character onto products of a completely different nature.<ref>{{citebook|title=Integrated Intellectual Asset Management|first= Steve|last= Manton|year=2005|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-566-08721-9}}</ref>\n\nExamples of intangible assets include a song (\"[[Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Rainbow]]\"), a character ([[Donald Duck]]), a name ([[Michael Jordan]]), or a brand (The [[Ritz-Carlton]]). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).<ref name=\"Brand Licensing Expert\">[http://www.brandlicensingexpert.com BrandLicensingExpert.com Peter Canalichio, Licensing Brands, Inc. CEO]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBrand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of [[patent]]s and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.\n\nThis process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. [[McDonald's]] play food, [[Burger King]] T-shirts and even ghastly [[Good Humor]] Halloween costumes became commonplace. [[Brand extension]]s later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to ''rent'' the product of an established brand name. [[Armor All]] auto vacuums, [[Breyers]] yogurt, [[TGI Friday's]] frozen appetizers, and [[Lucite]] nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.\n\n== Reasons for licensing ==\nA company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for [[brand extensions]] or products. For example, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a [[licensee]] make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded \"Earbud Headphones\", \"iPod docking stations\" and \"iPod socks.\" Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.\n\nApart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their [[merchandise]], but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee's products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:\n\n* Licensor chooses the product categories to be licensed   \n* Licensor finds and negotiates a license with the best licensees   \n* Licensees develop concepts, prototypes and final production samples and submit for approval   \n* Licensor approves licensed products for sale   \n* Licensees sell licensed products to authorized retailers<ref name=\"Marketing Professors\">[http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/971/pete-canalichio MarketingProfessors.com]</ref>\n\nLicensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. [[Royalties]] are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.<ref name=\"Atlanta Business Radio\">[http://atlantabusinessradio.businessradiox.com/atlanta-business-radio-interviews-swine-flu-expert-dr-elaina-george-brand-licensing-expert-pete-canalichio-and-batteries-plus-owner-john-cyphers/ Atlanta Business Radio Interview]</ref>\n\n== Global brand licensing industry ==\n\nThe main international [[professional association]] for brand licensing is the [[Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association]], which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.\n\nThe Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence  (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing.

Paul Blair, the swift center fielder who enjoyed a banner season, whacked five hits and drove in five runs. Left fielder [[Don Buford]] contributed four hits after going 0-for-9 in the first two games. Oriole Manager [[Earl Weaver]] employed simple strategy to deal with Minnesota's [[Harmon Killebrew]], AL MVP winner that year: Walk him in any dangerous situation. The Killer got nothing good to swing at until Game&nbsp;3 was on ice. Baltimore pitchers walked him five times in the first two games and pitched to him only when he could not wreck them with one swing.\n\n[[Rod Carew]] and [[Tony Oliva]] were the Twins' other top hitters during 1969. Carew, AL batting champ, was a dud in the playoffs, going 1-for-14. Oliva hit safely in each of the three games, including a home run in the opener, but was guilty of some shoddy fielding in the third game.\n\nThe Twins struck first in the bottom of the first off of [[Jim Palmer]] on [[Rich Reese]]'s RBI single after a two-out double and intentions walk, but [[Elrod Hendricks]]'s two-run double after a double and error put the Orioles up 2\u20131 in the second. Two outs later, [[Don Buford]]'s RBI single made it 3\u20130 Orioles and knock starter [[Bob Miller (baseball, born 1939)|Bob Miller]] out of the game. [[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]]'s two-run double in the fourth off of [[Dick Woodson]] made it 5\u20131 Orioles. The Twins scored their last run of the series in the fifth when [[Harmon Killebrew]] doubled with two outs and scored on Reese's single. [[Frank Robinson]]'s RBI single with two on off of [[Al Worthington]] made it 6\u20132 Orioles in the sixth. Blair's two-run home run in the eighth off of [[Dean Chance]] made it 8\u20132 Orioles. Next inning, [[Davey Johnson]] hit a leadoff single off of Chance, then scored on Hendricks's double off of [[Ron Perranoski]] while Hendricks himself scored on an error. [[Mark Belanger]] singled and scored on Blair's two-out double. Palmer pitched a scoreless ninth to finish the series.\n\nThis Monday game at Metropolitan Stadium forced the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] to play their game against division rival [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]] the previous day at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Minneapolis]].

Following his win over Savarese, Foreman fought Briggs.\n\nThe fight was controversial as Briggs ultimately picked up the victory by way of [[majority decision]].

Foreman landed 284 of his 488 punches for a 58% success rate while Briggs landed 45% of his punches, going 223 for 494. Foreman made $5 million, whilst Briggs received a $400,000 purse.\n\nForeman spent much of the fight as the aggressor while Briggs spent a lot of the fight retreating. In the later rounds Foreman's power punches seemed to take a toll on the younger Briggs, as he began slowing down and all but abandoned his tactic of moving away from Foreman and was hit from some heavy shots as a result. In the 12th and final round, Foreman tried hard for a knockout victory and was able to break Briggs' nose but was unable to score a knockdown.

Following his win over Savarese, Foreman fought Briggs.\n\nThe fight was controversial as Briggs ultimately picked up the victory by way of [[majority decision]].

Foreman landed 284 of his 488 punches for a 58% success rate while Briggs landed 45% of his punches, going 223 for 494. Foreman made $5 million, whilst Briggs received a $400,000 purse.\n\nForeman spent much of the fight as the aggressor while Briggs spent a lot of the fight retreating. In the later rounds Foreman's power punches seemed to take a toll on the younger Briggs, as he began slowing down and all but abandoned his tactic of moving away from Foreman and was hit from some heavy shots as a result. In the 12th and final round, Foreman tried hard for a knockout victory and was able to break Briggs' nose but was unable to score a knockdown.
