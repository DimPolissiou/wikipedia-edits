There he became infatuated with the pastor's daughter and, while praying for guidance, he opened his eyes and allegedly found the [[Bible]] open at [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 34:16]], stating that \"none should want for her mate\"; convinced this was a sign from God, he approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter, he was expelled from the congregation.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nIn 1981, Koresh moved to [[Waco, Texas]], where he joined the [[Branch Davidians]] (not to be confused with the original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist group). [[Benjamin Roden]], who died in 1978, originated the Branch group in 1955 with new teachings that were not connected with the original Davidians. Koresh played guitar and sang in church services at the [[Mount Carmel Center]], the sect's headquarters outside Waco.\n\n==Ascent to leadership of the Branch Davidians==\nIn 1983, Koresh began claiming the gift of [[prophecy]]. It is speculated by David Thibodeau in his 1999 book, ''A Place Called Waco'', that he had a sexual relationship with [[Lois Roden]], the widow of Benjamin Roden and leader of the cult, who was then <!-- Born August 1916. -->in her late-sixties, with Koresh eventually claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the [[Messiah|Chosen One]].<ref name=\"wilson\"/> In 1983, Lois allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message, called \"The Serpent's Root,\" which caused controversy in the group. Lois's son [[George Roden]] intended to be the cult's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper.\n\nWhen Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones (who then added Koresh to her name), there was a short period of calm at the Mount Carmel Center, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden claimed to have the support of the majority of the cult, forcing Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at [[Palestine, Texas]], {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Waco, where they lived under rough conditions in buses and tents for the next two years. During this time, Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in [[California]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]] and [[Australia]]. That same year he traveled to Israel, where he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern day [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].\n\nThe founder of the Davidian movement, [[Victor Houteff]], wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in [[Jerusalem]]. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991 he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the U.S. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel Center was the Davidic kingdom.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{Citation| surname=Valentine| given=Carol A.| title=David Koresh and The Cuckoo's Egg \u2013 pt. 3| year=2001| url=http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/page/b_kce3.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter being exiled to the Palestine camp, Koresh and his followers eked out a primitive existence. When Lois died in 1986, the exiled Branch Davidians wondered if they would ever be able to return to the Mount Carmel Center. But despite the displacement, \"Koresh now enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the [Branch Davidian] community\".<ref>David G. Bromley and Edward D. Silver, \"The Davidian Tradition: From Patronal Clan to Prophetic Movement,\" p.54 in Stuart A. Wright, Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995)</ref> By late 1987, Roden's support was in steep decline. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. Koresh went to authorities to file charges against Roden for illegally exhuming a corpse, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse).\n\nKoresh seized the opportunity to seek criminal [[prosecution]] of Roden by returning to the Mount Carmel Center with seven armed followers, allegedly attempting to get photographic proof of the crime. Koresh's group was discovered by Roden and a gunfight broke out. When the sheriff arrived, Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree. As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with [[attempted murder]]. At the trial, Koresh explained that he went to the Mount Carmel Center to uncover evidence of criminal disturbance of a corpse by Roden. Koresh's followers were [[acquittal|acquitted]], and in Koresh's case a [[Trial (law)|mistrial]] was declared.\n\nIn 1989, Roden murdered Wayman Dale Adair with an [[axe]] blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that he (Adair) was the true messiah.<ref>Marc Breault and Martin King, ''Inside the Cult'', Signet, 1st Printing June 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-451-18029-2}}.

Since Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes on the Mount Carmel Center, Koresh and his followers were able to raise the money and reclaim the property. Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by [[vexatious litigation|filing legal papers]] while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed the Mount Carmel Center, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a [[methamphetamine]] laboratory, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.<ref name=\"thibodeau\">{{Citation| surname=Thibodeau| given=David| title=The truth about Waco| year=1999| url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/09/waco/}}</ref><ref name=\"lujan\">Thomas R.

Linedecker, ''Massacre at Waco, Texas'', St. Martin's Press, 1993, page 94. {{ISBN|0-312-95226-0}}.</ref>\n\nKoresh is the Biblical name of Cyrus the Great (\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0634, Kurosh), a [[Persia|Persian king]] who is named a messiah for freeing Jews during the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. His first name, David, symbolized a lineage directly to the biblical [[King David]], from whom the new messiah would descend. By taking the name of David Koresh, he was \"professing himself to be the spiritual descendant of King David, a messianic figure carrying out a divinely commissioned errand.\"<ref>Bromley and Silver, p.57</ref>\n\n==Allegations of child abuse and statutory rape==\nKoresh was alleged to be involved in multiple incidents of [[child abuse]] and child [[sexual abuse]].<ref>See Christopher G. Ellison and John Bartkowski, \"'Babies Were Being Beaten': Exploring Child Abuse Allegations at Ranch Apocalypse,\" pp.111\u2013152 in Stuart A. Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995)</ref> His doctrine of the House of David<ref>See Bromley and Silver, pp.60\u201365</ref> did lead to \"marriages\" with both married and single women in the group, purportedly including with at least one underage girl. The underage girl was Michelle Jones, the younger sister of Koresh's legal wife Rachel and the daughter of lifelong Branch Davidians Perry and Mary Belle Jones. \n\nA six-month investigation of child abuse allegations by the Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 failed to turn up any evidence, possibly because the Branch Davidians concealed the spiritual marriage of Koresh to Michelle, assigning a surrogate husband (David Thibodeau) to the girl for the sake of appearances.<ref>David Thibodeau and Leon Whiteson, A Place Called Waco: A Survivor's Story (New York: Public Affairs, 1999)</ref>\n\nRegarding the allegations of child abuse, the evidence is less certain. In one widely reported incident, ex-members claimed that Koresh became irritated with the cries of his son Cyrus and spanked the child severely for several minutes on three consecutive visits to the child's bedroom. In a second report, a man involved in a custody battle visited the Mount Carmel Center and claimed to have seen the beating of a young boy with a stick.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nFinally, the FBI's justification for forcing an end to the 51-day standoff was predicated on the charge that Koresh was abusing children inside the Mount Carmel Center.  There were allegations he had fathered children with under-age girls in his cult. In hours following the deadly conflagration, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] told reporters that, \"We had specific information that babies were being beaten.\"<ref>Sam Howe Verovek, \"In Shadow of Texas Siege, Uncertainty for Innocents.\" New York Times, 1993, March 8</ref> However, [[FBI Director]] [[William Sessions]] publicly denied the charge and told reporters that they had no such information about child abuse inside the Mount Carmel Center.<ref>Stephen Labaton, \"Confusion Abounds in the Capital on Rationale for Assault on Cult,\" New York Times, 1993, April 21</ref> A careful examination of the other child abuse charges found the evidence to be weak and ambiguous, casting doubt on the allegations.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995</ref>\n\nThe allegations of child abuse stem largely from detractors and ex-members.<ref>John R.

Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco</ref> The 1993 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report cites allegations of child [[child sexual abuse|sexual]] and [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse. Legal scholars point out that the ATF had no legal jurisdiction in the matter of child protection and it appears that these accounts were inserted by the ATF to inflame the case against Koresh. For example, the account of former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds is reproduced in the affidavit. She claimed that Koresh had fathered at least fifteen children with various women and girls and that she had personally delivered seven of these infants. Bunds also claims that Koresh would annul all marriages of couples who joined the group and had exclusive sexual access to the women and girls.<ref name=\"dpmt_justice\">{{Citation |surname=U.S. Department of Justice |year=1993 |chapter=Evidence of Historical Child Sexual and Physical Abuse |title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas February 28 to April 19, 1993 (From ATF Affidavit in Support of Arrest of Koresh, taken from ATF Special Agent Aguilera's interview of former compound resident Jeannine Bunds, included in Agent Aguilera's affidavit in support of the Koresh arrest warrant \"Davy Aguilera, Special Agent Bureau of ATF, Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of February 1993 Dennis G.

The ensuing gun battle resulted in the deaths of four agents and six Branch Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] took command of the federal operation, because the FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. The negotiating team established contact with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators.\n\nKoresh himself had been seriously injured by a gunshot. As the standoff continued, Koresh and his closest male leaders negotiated delays, possibly so that he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations with the negotiators were dense and included biblical imagery. The federal negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis.\n\nThe siege of Mount Carmel Center ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] approved recommendations of FBI officials to proceed with a final advance in which the Branch Davidians were to be removed from their building by force. In an attempt to flush Koresh from the stronghold, the FBI resorted to pumping [[CS gas]] from a [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]] with battering ram into the compound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://libertyunderfire.org/2013/04/remembering-waco-and-the-branch-davidian-church-twenty-years-latter/|title=Remembering Waco and the Branch Davidian Church 20 years later.|date=April 30, 2013|newspaper=Liberty Under Fire|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the advance on the compound, the church building caught fire in circumstances that are still disputed.

There he became infatuated with the pastor's daughter and, while praying for guidance, he opened his eyes and allegedly found the [[Bible]] open at [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 34:16]], stating that \"none should want for her mate\"; convinced this was a sign from God, he approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter, he was expelled from the congregation.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nIn 1981, Koresh moved to [[Waco, Texas]], where he joined the [[Branch Davidians]] (not to be confused with the original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist group). [[Benjamin Roden]], who died in 1978, originated the Branch group in 1955 with new teachings that were not connected with the original Davidians. Koresh played guitar and sang in church services at the [[Mount Carmel Center]], the sect's headquarters outside Waco.\n\n==Ascent to leadership of the Branch Davidians==\nIn 1983, Koresh began claiming the gift of [[prophecy]]. It is speculated by David Thibodeau in his 1999 book, ''A Place Called Waco'', that he had a sexual relationship with [[Lois Roden]], the widow of Benjamin Roden and leader of the cult, who was then <!-- Born August 1916. -->in her late-sixties, with Koresh eventually claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the [[Messiah|Chosen One]].<ref name=\"wilson\"/> In 1983, Lois allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message, called \"The Serpent's Root,\" which caused controversy in the group. Lois's son [[George Roden]] intended to be the cult's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper.\n\nWhen Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones (who then added Koresh to her name), there was a short period of calm at the Mount Carmel Center, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden claimed to have the support of the majority of the cult, forcing Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at [[Palestine, Texas]], {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Waco, where they lived under rough conditions in buses and tents for the next two years. During this time, Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in [[California]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]] and [[Australia]]. That same year he traveled to Israel, where he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern day [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].\n\nThe founder of the Davidian movement, [[Victor Houteff]], wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in [[Jerusalem]]. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991 he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the U.S. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel Center was the Davidic kingdom.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{Citation| surname=Valentine| given=Carol A.| title=David Koresh and The Cuckoo's Egg \u2013 pt. 3| year=2001| url=http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/page/b_kce3.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter being exiled to the Palestine camp, Koresh and his followers eked out a primitive existence. When Lois died in 1986, the exiled Branch Davidians wondered if they would ever be able to return to the Mount Carmel Center. But despite the displacement, \"Koresh now enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the [Branch Davidian] community\".<ref>David G. Bromley and Edward D. Silver, \"The Davidian Tradition: From Patronal Clan to Prophetic Movement,\" p.54 in Stuart A. Wright, Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995)</ref> By late 1987, Roden's support was in steep decline. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. Koresh went to authorities to file charges against Roden for illegally exhuming a corpse, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse).\n\nKoresh seized the opportunity to seek criminal [[prosecution]] of Roden by returning to the Mount Carmel Center with seven armed followers, allegedly attempting to get photographic proof of the crime. Koresh's group was discovered by Roden and a gunfight broke out. When the sheriff arrived, Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree. As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with [[attempted murder]]. At the trial, Koresh explained that he went to the Mount Carmel Center to uncover evidence of criminal disturbance of a corpse by Roden. Koresh's followers were [[acquittal|acquitted]], and in Koresh's case a [[Trial (law)|mistrial]] was declared.\n\nIn 1989, Roden murdered Wayman Dale Adair with an [[axe]] blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that he (Adair) was the true messiah.<ref>Marc Breault and Martin King, ''Inside the Cult'', Signet, 1st Printing June 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-451-18029-2}}. (Australian edition entitled ''Preacher of Death'').</ref> Roden was [[insanity defense|judged insane]] and confined to a psychiatric hospital at [[Big Spring, Texas]]. Since Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes on the Mount Carmel Center, Koresh and his followers were able to raise the money and reclaim the property. Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by [[vexatious litigation|filing legal papers]] while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed the Mount Carmel Center, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a [[methamphetamine]] laboratory, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.<ref name=\"thibodeau\">{{Citation| surname=Thibodeau| given=David| title=The truth about Waco| year=1999| url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/09/waco/}}</ref><ref name=\"lujan\">Thomas R.

His first name, David, symbolized a lineage directly to the biblical [[King David]], from whom the new messiah would descend. By taking the name of David Koresh, he was \"professing himself to be the spiritual descendant of King David, a messianic figure carrying out a divinely commissioned errand.\"<ref>Bromley and Silver, p.57</ref>\n\n==Allegations of child abuse and statutory rape==\nKoresh was alleged to be involved in multiple incidents of [[child abuse]] and child [[sexual abuse]].<ref>See Christopher G. Ellison and John Bartkowski, \"'Babies Were Being Beaten': Exploring Child Abuse Allegations at Ranch Apocalypse,\" pp.111\u2013152 in Stuart A.

The underage girl was Michelle Jones, the younger sister of Koresh's legal wife Rachel and the daughter of lifelong Branch Davidians Perry and Mary Belle Jones. \n\nA six-month investigation of child abuse allegations by the Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 failed to turn up any evidence, possibly because the Branch Davidians concealed the spiritual marriage of Koresh to Michelle, assigning a surrogate husband (David Thibodeau) to the girl for the sake of appearances.<ref>David Thibodeau and Leon Whiteson, A Place Called Waco: A Survivor's Story (New York: Public Affairs, 1999)</ref>\n\nRegarding the allegations of child abuse, the evidence is less certain. In one widely reported incident, ex-members claimed that Koresh became irritated with the cries of his son Cyrus and spanked the child severely for several minutes on three consecutive visits to the child's bedroom. In a second report, a man involved in a custody battle visited the Mount Carmel Center and claimed to have seen the beating of a young boy with a stick.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nFinally, the FBI's justification for forcing an end to the 51-day standoff was predicated on the charge that Koresh was abusing children inside the Mount Carmel Center.  There were allegations he had fathered children with under-age girls in his cult. In hours following the deadly conflagration, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] told reporters that, \"We had specific information that babies were being beaten.\"<ref>Sam Howe Verovek, \"In Shadow of Texas Siege, Uncertainty for Innocents.\" New York Times, 1993, March 8</ref> However, [[FBI Director]] [[William Sessions]] publicly denied the charge and told reporters that they had no such information about child abuse inside the Mount Carmel Center.<ref>Stephen Labaton, \"Confusion Abounds in the Capital on Rationale for Assault on Cult,\" New York Times, 1993, April 21</ref> A careful examination of the other child abuse charges found the evidence to be weak and ambiguous, casting doubt on the allegations.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995</ref>\n\nThe allegations of child abuse stem largely from detractors and ex-members.<ref>John R.

Legal scholars point out that the ATF had no legal jurisdiction in the matter of child protection and it appears that these accounts were inserted by the ATF to inflame the case against Koresh. For example, the account of former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds is reproduced in the affidavit. She claimed that Koresh had fathered at least fifteen children with various women and girls and that she had personally delivered seven of these infants. Bunds also claims that Koresh would annul all marriages of couples who joined the group and had exclusive sexual access to the women and girls.<ref name=\"dpmt_justice\">{{Citation |surname=U.S. Department of Justice |year=1993 |chapter=Evidence of Historical Child Sexual and Physical Abuse |title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas February 28 to April 19, 1993 (From ATF Affidavit in Support of Arrest of Koresh, taken from ATF Special Agent Aguilera's interview of former compound resident Jeannine Bunds, included in Agent Aguilera's affidavit in support of the Koresh arrest warrant \"Davy Aguilera, Special Agent Bureau of ATF, Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of February 1993 Dennis G.

The ensuing gun battle resulted in the deaths of four agents and six Branch Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] took command of the federal operation, because the FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. The negotiating team established contact with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators.\n\nKoresh himself had been seriously injured by a gunshot. As the standoff continued, Koresh and his closest male leaders negotiated delays, possibly so that he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations with the negotiators were dense and included biblical imagery. The federal negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis.\n\nThe siege of Mount Carmel Center ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] approved recommendations of FBI officials to proceed with a final advance in which the Branch Davidians were to be removed from their building by force. In an attempt to flush Koresh from the stronghold, the FBI resorted to pumping [[CS gas]] from a [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]] with battering ram into the compound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://libertyunderfire.org/2013/04/remembering-waco-and-the-branch-davidian-church-twenty-years-latter/|title=Remembering Waco and the Branch Davidian Church 20 years later.|date=April 30, 2013|newspaper=Liberty Under Fire|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the advance on the compound, the church building caught fire in circumstances that are still disputed.

One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. \n\nMukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik\u2019s relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for the last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK.\n\nMadhu visits RK\u2019s set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Balraj\u2019s treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK\u2019s set after he had shown up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala\u2019s life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her.\n\nEventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. \n\nShamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK\u2019s life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. \n\nMadhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. \n\nMadhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves her. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets a job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't come back unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers to RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film.

He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead in the bomb blast.

It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning a living.

One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. \n\nMukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik\u2019s relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for the last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK.\n\nMadhu visits RK\u2019s set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Balraj\u2019s treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK\u2019s set after he had shown up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala\u2019s life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her.\n\nEventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. \n\nShamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK\u2019s life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. \n\nMadhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. \n\nMadhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves her. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets a job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't come back unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers to RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him and chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. \n\nRK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. \n\nSuper excited, RK appears as the leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK\u2019s aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali\u2019s plot to oust her from RK\u2019s life.\n\nMadhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn\u2019t want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu\u2019s heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. \n\nThe movie \u201cIshq Ek Junoon\u201d becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers a miscarriage and blames RK. He misunderstands her thought of becoming a superstar like him and tries his best to avert her mind from getting into the film industry. Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be.\n\nEnters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK\u2019s money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK\u2019s place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead in the bomb blast. RK' mother escapes with RK and Madhu's infant 'Madhubala' and raises her without the shadow of cinema industry as it would become a threat for Junior Madhubala. Radha gets unwell and, Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge the death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. \n\nRaja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises the question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions.\n\nThis leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja\u2019s aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning a living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. \n\nMadhubala reads Madhu\u2019s diary, learning that Madhu\u2019s last wish was to make a film on her and RK\u2019s life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film.

Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is.<ref>Glenn. Jerome. Chapter 9 Defense, Future Mind, Acropolis Books, Washington, DC 1989</ref> Information warfare may involve the [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|collection]] of tactical information, [[information assurance|assurance(s)]] that one's own information is valid, spreading of [[propaganda]] or [[disinformation]] to [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralize]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~burnsm/InfoWarfare.html|title=Information Warfare: What and How?|website=www.cs.cmu.edu|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force's information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

In fact, the official mission of the U.S. Air Force is now \"To fly, fight and win...in air, space and cyberspace\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.com/learn-about/our-mission/|title=About the Air Force: Our Mission - airforce.com|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> with the latter referring to its information warfare role.\n\nAs the U.S. Air Force often risks aircraft and aircrews to attack strategic enemy communications targets, remotely disabling such targets using software and other means can provide a safer alternative. In addition, disabling such networks electronically (instead of explosively) also allows them to be quickly re-enabled after the enemy territory is occupied. Similarly, counter-information warfare units are employed to deny such capability to the enemy. The first application of these techniques was used against Iraqi communications networks in the [[Gulf War]].\n\nAlso during the Gulf War, Dutch [[Security cracking|hackers]] allegedly stole information about U.S. troop movements from [[U.S. Defense Department]] computers and tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/9bdfd653327fc9c17e643090f08d1d04|title=Computer security experts: Dutch hackers stole Gulf War secrets|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> In January 1999, U.S. Air Intelligence computers were hit by a coordinated attack ([[Moonlight Maze]]), part of which came from a Russian mainframe.

The three most prevalent revolutions in military affairs come in the form of [[cyberattack]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s  and [[communication management]].\n\nWithin the realm of cyberspace, there are two primary weapons: network-centric warfare and [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], which denotes integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Furthermore, cyberspace attacks initiated by one nation against another nation have an underlying goal of gaining [[information superiority]] over the attacked party, which includes disrupting or denying the victimized party's ability to gather and distribute information. A real-world occurrence that illustrated the dangerous potential of cyberattacks transpired in 2007, when [[Operation Orchard|a strike from Israeli forces demolished an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria]] that was being constructed via a collaborative effort between Syria and North Korea. Accompanied with the strike was a cyberattack on Syria's air defenses, which left them blind to the attack on the nuclear reactor and, ultimately allowed for the attack to occur (New York Times 2014). An example of a more basic attack on a nation within cyberspace is a [[Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDOS) attack, which is utilized to hinder networks or websites until they lose their primary functionality. As implied, cyberattacks do not just affect the military party being attacked, but rather the whole population of the victimized nation. Since more aspects of daily life are being integrated into networks in cyberspace, civilian populations can potentially be negatively affected during wartime. For example, if a nation chose to attack another nation's [[power grid]] servers in a specific area to disrupt communications, civilians and businesses in that area would also have to deal with [[power outage]]s, which could potentially lead to economic disruptions as well.\n\nMoreover, physical ICTs have also been implemented into the latest revolution in military affairs by deploying new, more autonomous robots (i.e. \u2013 [[unmanned drone]]s) into the battlefield to carry out duties such as patrolling borders and attacking ground targets. Humans from remote locations pilot many of the unmanned drones, however, some of the more advanced robots, such as the [[Northrop Grumman X-47B]], are capable of autonomous decisions.  Despite piloting the drones from remote locations, a proportion of drone pilots still suffer from stress factors of more traditional warfare. According to NPR, a study performed by the Pentagon in 2011 found that 29% of drone pilots are \u201cburned out\u201d and undergo high levels of stress. Furthermore, approximately 17% of the drone pilots surveyed as the study were labeled \u201cclinically distressed\u201d with some of those pilots also showing signs of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/19/143926857/report-high-levels-of-burnout-in-u-s-drone-pilots|title=Report: High Levels Of 'Burnout' In U.S. Drone Pilots|date=18 December 2011|work=NPR.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern ICTs have also brought advancements to communications management among military forces. Communication is a vital aspect of war for any involved party and, through the implementation of new ICTs such as data-enabled devices, military forces are now able to [[information dissemination|disseminate information]] faster than ever before. For example, some militaries are now employing the use of [[iPhone]]s to upload data and information gathered by drones in the same area.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Information Warfare: A Philosophical Perspective|doi=10.1007/s13347-011-0040-9|volume=25|journal=Philosophy & Technology|pages=105\u2013120|author=Taddeo Mariarosaria|year = 2012|url=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/2299/8987/1/904727.pdf|hdl=2299/8987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/middleeast/obama-worried-about-effects-of-waging-cyberwar-in-syria.html|title=Syria War Stirs New U.S. Debate on Cyberattacks|author= DAVID E. SANGER |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=2014-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Legal and ethical concerns==\n\nWhile information warfare has yielded many advances in the types of attack that a government can make, it has also raised concerns about the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding this particularly new form of war.  Traditionally, wars have been analyzed by moral scholars according to [[Just War Theory]].  However, with Information Warfare, Just War Theory fails because the theory is based on the traditional conception of war.  Information Warfare has three main issues surrounding it compared to traditional warfare:\n\n#The risk for the party or nation initiating the cyberattack is substantially lower than the risk for a party or nation initiating a traditional attack.  This makes it easier for governments, as well as potential terrorist or [[criminal organization]]s, to make these attacks more frequently than they could with traditional war.\n#Information communication technologies (ICT) are so immersed in the modern world that a very wide range of technologies are at risk of a cyberattack.  Specifically, civilian technologies can be targeted for cyberattacks and attacks can even potentially be launched through civilian computers or websites.  As such, it is harder to enforce control of civilian infrastructures than a physical space.   Attempting to do so would also raise many ethical concerns about the right to privacy, making defending against such attacks even tougher.\n#The mass-integration of ICT into our system of war makes it much harder to assess accountability for situations that may arise when using robotic and/or cyber attacks.  For robotic weapons and automated systems, it's becoming increasingly hard to determine who is responsible for any particular event that happens.  This issue is exacerbated in the case of cyberattacks, as sometimes it is virtually impossible to trace who initiated the attack in the first place.<ref name=\"mariarosariataddeo\"/>\n\nRecently, legal concerns have arisen centered on these issues, specifically the issue of the [[right to privacy]] in the United States of America.

Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is.<ref>Glenn. Jerome. Chapter 9 Defense, Future Mind, Acropolis Books, Washington, DC 1989</ref> Information warfare may involve the [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|collection]] of tactical information, [[information assurance|assurance(s)]] that one's own information is valid, spreading of [[propaganda]] or [[disinformation]] to [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralize]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~burnsm/InfoWarfare.html|title=Information Warfare: What and How?|website=www.cs.cmu.edu|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force's information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

In fact, the official mission of the U.S. Air Force is now \"To fly, fight and win...in air, space and cyberspace\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.com/learn-about/our-mission/|title=About the Air Force: Our Mission - airforce.com|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> with the latter referring to its information warfare role.\n\nAs the U.S. Air Force often risks aircraft and aircrews to attack strategic enemy communications targets, remotely disabling such targets using software and other means can provide a safer alternative. In addition, disabling such networks electronically (instead of explosively) also allows them to be quickly re-enabled after the enemy territory is occupied. Similarly, counter-information warfare units are employed to deny such capability to the enemy. The first application of these techniques was used against Iraqi communications networks in the [[Gulf War]].\n\nAlso during the Gulf War, Dutch [[Security cracking|hackers]] allegedly stole information about U.S. troop movements from [[U.S. Defense Department]] computers and tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/9bdfd653327fc9c17e643090f08d1d04|title=Computer security experts: Dutch hackers stole Gulf War secrets|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> In January 1999, U.S. Air Intelligence computers were hit by a coordinated attack ([[Moonlight Maze]]), part of which came from a Russian mainframe.

The three most prevalent revolutions in military affairs come in the form of [[cyberattack]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s  and [[communication management]].\n\nWithin the realm of cyberspace, there are two primary weapons: network-centric warfare and [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], which denotes integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Furthermore, cyberspace attacks initiated by one nation against another nation have an underlying goal of gaining [[information superiority]] over the attacked party, which includes disrupting or denying the victimized party's ability to gather and distribute information. A real-world occurrence that illustrated the dangerous potential of cyberattacks transpired in 2007, when [[Operation Orchard|a strike from Israeli forces demolished an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria]] that was being constructed via a collaborative effort between Syria and North Korea. Accompanied with the strike was a cyberattack on Syria's air defenses, which left them blind to the attack on the nuclear reactor and, ultimately allowed for the attack to occur (New York Times 2014). An example of a more basic attack on a nation within cyberspace is a [[Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDOS) attack, which is utilized to hinder networks or websites until they lose their primary functionality. As implied, cyberattacks do not just affect the military party being attacked, but rather the whole population of the victimized nation. Since more aspects of daily life are being integrated into networks in cyberspace, civilian populations can potentially be negatively affected during wartime. For example, if a nation chose to attack another nation's [[power grid]] servers in a specific area to disrupt communications, civilians and businesses in that area would also have to deal with [[power outage]]s, which could potentially lead to economic disruptions as well.\n\nMoreover, physical ICTs have also been implemented into the latest revolution in military affairs by deploying new, more autonomous robots (i.e. \u2013 [[unmanned drone]]s) into the battlefield to carry out duties such as patrolling borders and attacking ground targets. Humans from remote locations pilot many of the unmanned drones, however, some of the more advanced robots, such as the [[Northrop Grumman X-47B]], are capable of autonomous decisions.  Despite piloting the drones from remote locations, a proportion of drone pilots still suffer from stress factors of more traditional warfare. According to NPR, a study performed by the Pentagon in 2011 found that 29% of drone pilots are \u201cburned out\u201d and undergo high levels of stress. Furthermore, approximately 17% of the drone pilots surveyed as the study were labeled \u201cclinically distressed\u201d with some of those pilots also showing signs of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/19/143926857/report-high-levels-of-burnout-in-u-s-drone-pilots|title=Report: High Levels Of 'Burnout' In U.S. Drone Pilots|date=18 December 2011|work=NPR.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern ICTs have also brought advancements to communications management among military forces. Communication is a vital aspect of war for any involved party and, through the implementation of new ICTs such as data-enabled devices, military forces are now able to [[information dissemination|disseminate information]] faster than ever before. For example, some militaries are now employing the use of [[iPhone]]s to upload data and information gathered by drones in the same area.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Information Warfare: A Philosophical Perspective|doi=10.1007/s13347-011-0040-9|volume=25|journal=Philosophy & Technology|pages=105\u2013120|author=Taddeo Mariarosaria|year = 2012|url=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/2299/8987/1/904727.pdf|hdl=2299/8987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/middleeast/obama-worried-about-effects-of-waging-cyberwar-in-syria.html|title=Syria War Stirs New U.S. Debate on Cyberattacks|author= DAVID E. SANGER |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=2014-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Legal and ethical concerns==\n\nWhile information warfare has yielded many advances in the types of attack that a government can make, it has also raised concerns about the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding this particularly new form of war.  Traditionally, wars have been analyzed by moral scholars according to [[Just War Theory]].  However, with Information Warfare, Just War Theory fails because the theory is based on the traditional conception of war.  Information Warfare has three main issues surrounding it compared to traditional warfare:\n\n#The risk for the party or nation initiating the cyberattack is substantially lower than the risk for a party or nation initiating a traditional attack.  This makes it easier for governments, as well as potential terrorist or [[criminal organization]]s, to make these attacks more frequently than they could with traditional war.\n#Information communication technologies (ICT) are so immersed in the modern world that a very wide range of technologies are at risk of a cyberattack.  Specifically, civilian technologies can be targeted for cyberattacks and attacks can even potentially be launched through civilian computers or websites.  As such, it is harder to enforce control of civilian infrastructures than a physical space.   Attempting to do so would also raise many ethical concerns about the right to privacy, making defending against such attacks even tougher.\n#The mass-integration of ICT into our system of war makes it much harder to assess accountability for situations that may arise when using robotic and/or cyber attacks.  For robotic weapons and automated systems, it's becoming increasingly hard to determine who is responsible for any particular event that happens.  This issue is exacerbated in the case of cyberattacks, as sometimes it is virtually impossible to trace who initiated the attack in the first place.<ref name=\"mariarosariataddeo\"/>\n\nRecently, legal concerns have arisen centered on these issues, specifically the issue of the [[right to privacy]] in the United States of America.  Lt. General [[Keith B. Alexander]], who served as the head of Cyber Command under President [[Barack Obama]], noted that there was a \u201cmismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies\u201d when writing to the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]].
