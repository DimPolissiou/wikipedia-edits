{"title_page": "Climate of Dubai", "text_new": "[[File:Dubai Skyline on 10 January 2008.jpg|270px|thumb|Clouds over Dubai in winter]]\nDubai has a [[hot desert climate]]. Dubai has two distinct seasons - summer and winter. Summer in Dubai begins around the last week of April and ends around the first week of October. This period is characterized by hot weather, warm winds and high humidity. Due to the city's close proximity to the sea the temperatures in Dubai are milder in summer in comparison to other Gulf cities such as Kuwait City and Riyadh. However this means the city has a high humidity which can make the weather very unpleasant. Rainfall is scarce during the summer months, but the windy conditions ensure there are frequent [[dust storms]]. Temperatures regularly climb above {{convert|38|C|0|abbr=on}} during this period and fall to around {{convert|26|C|0|abbr=on}} overnight. Winter in Dubai begins around the last week of October and lasts until the beginning of April. The winter season has the most pleasant weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Most of the precipitation takes place during this season. Strong thunderstorms are not uncommon to the city during this period, this is accompanied by strong north-westerly winds and lower temperatures. Average daytime high during the winter season is around {{convert|22|C|0|abbr=on}} with overnight lows of {{convert|12|C|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall has been increasing over the past few decades accumulating to {{convert|130|mm|2|abbr=on}} per year.<ref>Citation error.

[[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[urban heat island]] effect does have its toll on Dubai as well, for example during the winter months when temperatures regularly fall to around {{convert|5|C|0|abbr=on}} in the outskirts of the city and its suburbs, the temperatures in Central Dubai rarely fall below {{convert|9|C|0|abbr=on}}. This can be clearly seen when comparing weather data from the city's two airports - [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai International]] and [[Al Maktoum International Airport|Dubai World Central]]. The highest temperature recorded in Dubai is {{convert|48.2|C|0|abbr=on}} reached in July 1996.<ref>Citation error.

Dubai has two distinct seasons - summer and winter. Summer in Dubai begins around the last week of April and ends around the first week of October. This period is characterized by hot weather, warm winds and high humidity. Due to the city's close proximity to the sea the temperatures in Dubai are milder in summer in comparison to other Gulf cities such as Kuwait City and Riyadh. However this means the city has a high humidity which can make the weather very unpleasant. Rainfall is scarce during the summer months, but the windy conditions ensure there are frequent [[dust storms]]. Temperatures regularly climb above {{convert|38|C|0|abbr=on}} during this period and fall to around {{convert|26|C|0|abbr=on}} overnight. Winter in Dubai begins around the last week of October and lasts until the beginning of April. The winter season has the most pleasant weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Most of the precipitation takes place during this season. Strong thunderstorms are not uncommon to the city during this period, this is accompanied by strong north-westerly winds and lower temperatures. Average daytime high during the winter season is around {{convert|22|C|0|abbr=on}} with overnight lows of {{convert|12|C|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall has been increasing over the past few decades accumulating to {{convert|130|mm|2|abbr=on}} per year.<ref>Citation error.

They use a GPS receiver to show the precise location and provide visual and spoken directions on how to drive to the specified destination. Some TomTom systems also integrate with [[mobile phone]]s using Bluetooth, [[traffic congestion map]]s or to actually take calls and read [[short message service|SMS messages]] aloud.\n\nModels are largely hardware-compatible, with different software; it has been reported that some users have been able to upgrade low-cost hardware with the software of more advanced models, for example providing a One&nbsp;XL or Go&nbsp;510 with most of the functionality of a Go&nbsp;940.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.support.tomtom.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6133/~/updating-the-software-on-your-navigation-device|title=TomTom Support|website=uk.support.tomtom.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>\n\n* '''TomTom GO''' \u2013 an all-in-one GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV2 and NAV3 models, but only on certain NAV4 models).The TomTom Go models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Camper & Caravan / RV''' \u2013 an all-in-one GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. In Europe, the Camper model is based on the TomTom Go&nbsp;1005, in North America the RV models are based on the NAV3 Start 60 model. The TomTom Camper & Caravan and RV models belong to the NAV3 range and their biggest difference compared to other NAV3 models is the map that is supplied with, which allows certain size and weight data to be entered and being considered in the route planning. Technically any NAV3 device can be made to a Camper/RV editing by purchasing the camper map from the TomTom webshop.\n* '''TomTom Truck''' \u2013 designed for professional truck drivers and include truck-specific software and maps. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV3 models).The TomTom Pro/Truck models belong either to the NAV3 or NAV4 ranges. A few years ago truck maps were available to NAV2 models too.\n* '''TomTom Via''' \u2013 middle class GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. All the TomTom Via models belong to the NAV3 range.\n* '''TomTom Start''' \u2013 an entry-level GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]], but usually a lower HW specification, compared to the Via and Go models. Some models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. The TomTom Start models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom One and One XL''' \u2013 The TomTom One is the base model for [[automotive navigation system|automobile navigation]]. The difference between the TomTom One XL and the TomTom One is the size of the touch screen (4.3 vs 3.5&nbsp;in or 110 vs 89&nbsp;mm).  Neither model of the One contains the added functions included in the Go models, such as Bluetooth hands-free calling and MP3 Jukebox.  However, the One is able to receive traffic and weather updates using the TomTom Plus service when paired via Bluetooth with a mobile phone with a DUN data service.  The reduced software capability means less demand on the hardware, which allows the One to be sold at a significantly lower price than the Go. The ''XL'' is also available as a ''Live'' version with integrated Live Services.\n* '''TomTom Rider''' \u2013 Portable water-resistant models for [[motorcycle]] and [[motorscooter]] users. They differ from other devices in that the Rider is partly shielded and has a 'glove-friendly' screen and GUI. There are many different models in the NAV2 and NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Navigator''' \u2013 a GPS navigation software product for [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[Palm (device)|Palm]] devices, [[Pocket PC]]s, and some smartphones. TomTom Navigator 6 replaced the earlier TomTom Mobile 5.2. It can use GPS receivers built into the device or external (e.g., Bluetooth-connected) receivers. Navigator 7 was the latest release of this software, released as a part of the software that came with the June 2008 HTC Touch Diamond. Frequently used functions can be added to the main screen of the program, and users can report map corrections and share them with other users. Navigator supports touch screens; devices without touch screens use a cursor to input data.  The software is available on SD card and DVD. It runs on a number of devices listed on the TomTom website, but will run successfully on many unlisted devices using the [[Windows Mobile]] [[operating system]], discontinued in 2010. The DVD version includes a DVD, printed 15-character product code, Quick Start Guide, Licensing Agreement, a poster with a picture diagram for setup procedure of DVD version and SD card version, and an advertisement for associated TomTom Plus services.  The DVD contains installation software for [[TomTom Home]], software for mobile devices, licenses, manuals, maps, and voices.  The software for mobile devices includes CAB files for Palm, PPC, Symbian, and UIQ3.<ref>The container states that this product is compatible with: ACER N310-B, N311-BW, N35, N50; Asus MyPal A632N, MyPal A636N; Dell AXIM X51, Axim X51v; Eten M600; Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX 720, Pocket LOOX N520; HP iPAQ h1450, h4350, hw6510, hw6515, hw6910, hw6915, hx2190, hx2490, rx1950, rz1710; i-Mate JAM, JAMin, PDA-N, PDA2k; Mio 168, A201, A701, P350; Nokia E50, E61, N80; O2 XDA Exec; Orange SPV M1000, SPV M2000, SPV M3000; Palm Treo 700W, Treo 650; Qtek G100, S100, S110, 9000; T-Mobile MDA compact, MDA III, MDA Pro. {{cite book|publisher=TomTom|title=NAVIGATOR 6 DVD|format=software package|id= article no. 1T90.080, part no. 1T90.080S}}</ref>\n*'''TomTom for iOS''' \u2013 GPS navigation software product for [[iOS]] devices, originally announced for the [[iPhone]] at the Apple [[WWDC]] Keynote speech in early June 2009, and released internationally on 15 August 2009 in the Apple App Store, with various map packs for different regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=326055452 |title=TomTom for iPhone |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> TomTom Vice President of Marketing Development gave information in an interview by [[Macworld]] in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141539/2009/07/tomtomiphoneupdate.html |title=TomTom for iPhone en route &#124; Software &#124; iPhone Central |publisher=Macworld |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> Currently the app works with iPhone (all models), the iPod Touch (all models) and the iPad (all models), however Apple dropped the support for the early models and latest versions of the TomTom iOS app might have issues on certain devices.

Turkey and Greece were not included in the larger ''Europe'' map pack; this is related to the AppStore's app size limitation of 2 GB. These maps are available separately. Iceland is not available in any map package sold by TomTom at the moment, but they are working on it (and a few other countries too). Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available, based on the NavKit, which might cure the issue with the size limit (also Apple increased the app size limit to 4GB).\n*'''TomTom Go Mobile''', GPS navigation software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It replaced the old app, which had similar features to the iOS app. In March 2015, TomTom announced the new TomTom GO Mobile app for Android with a freemium subscription model for maps with the first 50 miles/75 kilometres per month being free, including all the maps that are available, TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. The previous app, which had promised \"free lifetime updates\", is not available for purchase on [[Play Store]] anymore and its maps are not updated since October 2015. TomTom claims their definition of lifetime map updates is \"the period of time that TomTom continues to support the app with updates\". Previous customers of TomTom's Android navigation app are offered a discount on the subscription in the new app for three years. There is no provision for users who want to keep using the old app under the conditions it was sold with lifetime map updates.\n*'''TomTom Speed Cameras''', a mobile software application released in 2015 free of charge.<ref>https://recombu.com/cars/article/tomtom-speed-cameras-app-to-keep-you-on-the-right-side-of-the-law</ref>\n\nNavigation software for several mobile phones discontinued after release 5.2; Navigator, which does not support all the phones that Mobile did, is the nearest equivalent. Mobile 5.2 cannot use maps later than v6.60 build 1223; this and earlier program versions are not compatible with all map versions, particularly other builds of version 6.\n\nIn September 2012, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] collaborated with TomTom to provide mapping data for its revamped iOS 6 updated [[Apple Maps]] app.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/tomtom-confirmed-as-official-partner-for-ios-6-maps-1084678|title=TomTom confirmed as official partner for iOS 6 Maps|work=TechRadar|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}</ref> The partnership was in part due to Apple's decision to wean itself off the products of its competitor, [[Google]]. As of 2018 TomTom continues to provide data for Apple Maps.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-tomtom/apple-rebuilds-mapping-app-but-will-still-tap-tomtom-idUSKBN1JP32S</ref>\n\n==TomTom Home and MyDrive Connect==\nTomTom Home (stylized as TomTom HOME) is a 32-bit PC application that allows synchronization/updates to be sent to the mobile device. The container states that it is compatible with Mac OS X v10.3 or greater and Windows ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (see above reference). After installation, it has options to choose a device to be associated to and activate the software.  A caution is given that the software only allows one device to be associated to an email address and the associated device can be changed only after 14 days since the previous association. TomTom Home version 2.0 and above is implemented on the [[XULRunner]] platform. With version 2.2, TomTom Home added a content-sharing platform where users can download and upload content to personalize their device such as voices, start-up images, [[Point of Interest|POI]] sets, etc. At the moment TomTom Home is on version 2.9.\n\nDespite being based on the cross-platform XULRunner, TomTom Home lacks support for Linux (and most probably it won't ever support, as the NAV2 devices are mostly legacy models by now).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/home|title=TomTom HOME software downloads page|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724234645/http://www.tomtom.com/home/|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is, for instance, impossible to update the maps in these devices by connecting them to another machine running Linux, even when using a common web browser like Firefox that normally allowed such an update under Microsoft Windows. \nHowever, the devices can still be read in a Linux OS as a disk drive. There is even software made by the community to manage some functions of\nthe TomTom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pytomtom.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page|title=pyTOMTOM}}</ref>\n\nThe NAV3 and NAV4 range of models use MyDrive Connect. MyDrive Connect is compatible with 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 preview and with most Mac OS X versions. The internal flash memory or the memory card content of the device cannot be accessed through USB for security reasons (modified applications would easily accept a map that wasn't sold by TomTom). The device can update itself by getting files through the HTTP protocol over USB. The support app is nothing more than a proxy on the PC buffering the download. So far the security achieved using this mechanism has not been broken yet. Also, the usage of the non-FAT/FAT32 file system brought stability improvements in device operations. On the downside, some users might experience compatibility issues between their PC, device and the MyDrive Connect support application. For those issues, TomTom Customer Services or members of the community forum are usually able to provide solutions.\n\n==TomTom built-in navigation==\nTomTom partners with several car manufacturers and offers built-in navigation solutions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Currently, the fees are only for European countries.\n\nTraffic data is also available to subscribers in many parts of Europe and the US via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled cell phone with Internet service or an add-on aerial, which picks up [[Traffic Message Channel|RDS]] data (broadcast on [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio frequencies) offering traffic information without the requirement for a data connection.  The TomTom Plus service is not compatible with Apple's [[iPhone]].\n\n===TomTom Live Services===\nIn October 2008 the company released Live Services on the Go 940 Live. These allowed users to receive updates over the mobile telephone network using the SIM card in the device. These services included HD Traffic, Safety Alerts, Local Search with Google and Fuel Prices.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, TomTom announced that it was offering up its real-time traffic products to \"industry partners\" in the United States.<ref>Don Reisinger, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20062210-17.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 TomTom offering real-time traffic data to partners].\" 12 May 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2011.</ref>\n\nOn the latest NAV4 devices the service is not available anymore in the old form. The included services had been separated and now being called TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. On the x0/x00/x000 devices the traffic service is free of charge either via the built-in SIM (Always Connected models) or via a compatible smartphone (Smartphone Connected or BYOD \u2013 Bring Your Own Device). The speed camera service is free for three months on these models. However, there is a newer range, the x10/x100 models, which come now with free lifetime speed camera subscription too.\n\n===Map Share===\nMap Share is a proprietary map technology launched by TomTom in June 2007.  Map Share allows users to make changes to the maps on their navigation devices and share them with others. It allows drivers to make changes to their maps directly on their navigation devices. Drivers can block or unblock streets, change the direction of traffic, edit street names and add, edit or remove points of interest (POIs). Improvements can be shared with other users through TomTom HOME, TomTom's content management software.\n\nAn online version called Map Share Reporter is on the TomTom website.\n\n===TomTom Traffic (previously HD Traffic)===\nA traffic monitoring service that uses multiple sources to provide traffic information. The service does this by combining data from:\n* traditional sources: governmental/third-party data such as induction loops in the roads, cameras and traffic surveillance\n* new sources: traffic flow of millions of anonymous mobile phone users<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/services/service.php?id=2&tab=4|title=TomTom HD Traffic \u2013 How it works}}</ref>\n\nThe information is merged by TomTom and algorithms are used to improve the data and filter out anomalous readings. The system sends updates to all TomTom Traffic users every two minutes (and the data the users receive is never older than 30 seconds). Users can receive the service through the built-in SIM, via a smartphone connection or on older devices via a standard phone connection. Re-routing can be set to be transparent to the user with the only sign that the route has been changed due to a traffic jam being a sound indication from the device and a changed {{abbr|ETA|estimated time of arrival}}.\n\nThe system was first launched in the Netherlands in 2007 and expanded to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland in 2008. By mid-2011, TomTom Live services including TomTom Traffic are available in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand and the following seventeen European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. {{Asof|2015}}, the service is vastly expanded and current coverage is available on the TomTom Traffic site (34 countries {{asof|2015|06|26|lc=on}} and the list expands every few months to new regions).\n\n'''TomTom Traffic improvements'''\n*''HD Traffic 6.0'' (August 2012): More accurate location of traffic jams, improved coverage of automatically detected road closures\n*''TomTom Traffic 7.0'' (September 2013): Increased accuracy of jam location now allows for 'Jam Ahead Warnings', warning drivers when approaching a jam-tail too fast. Improved coverage of automatic road closure detection started to include also major secondary roads. Automatic road works detection on highways. TomTom also added 'Predictive Flow Feed' for better predicting approaching traffic delays, with the goal of improving optimal route calculation and ETA.\n*''TomTom Traffic 8.0'' (November 2014): TomTom included real-time weather information in their routing algorithms, and warns users in areas of bad weather. Also, version 8.0 now incorporates in their real-time traffic information road closures that are reported via the online Map Share Reporter tool.\n\n===IQ Routes===\nIQ Routes, developed by TomTom and available since spring 2008 on the TomTom Go 730 and Go 930, uses anonymous travel time data accumulated by users of TomTom satnav devices. Newer TomTom devices use this data to take into account the time and day when determining the fastest route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloginfomanage.blogspot.com/2008/01/tomtom-collecting-data-from-gps-systems.html|title=Information Management: TomTom collecting data from GPS Systems}}</ref>\n\nTravel time data is stored in Historical Speed Profiles, one for each road segment, covering large motorways, main roads and also small local roads. Historic Speed Profiles are part of the digital map and are updated with every new map release. They give insight into real-world traffic patterns. This is a fact-based routing system based on measured travel times, compared to most other methods which use speed limits or \u2018assumed\u2019 speeds.\n\nIn September 2008, map upgrade v8.10 was released for x20 series models, extending the IQ Routes feature to those devices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |title=(click on \"show detailed map information\") |publisher=Tomtom.com |accessdate=2010-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126181249/http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with a free software update using TomTom Home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.support.tomtom.com/cgi-bin/tomtom_uk.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=9552|title=TomTom FAQs \u2013 IQ Routes|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>\n\nOn the NAV3 and NAV4 models the IQ Routes feature is available by default on all map versions.\n\n===Enhanced Positioning Technology===\nOffers continuous navigation, even when a navigation device can't receive GPS satellite signals (e.g. in tunnels or amongst high buildings) using [[Accelerometer|movement and gravity sensors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=318538|title=TomTom introduces New High-End Model: TomTom GO 920 (AMS:TOMTOM)|website=corporate.tomtom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref>\n\n===Mapping===\nTomTom products use [[Tele Atlas]] based maps. Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight and the TomTom Map Share Reporter Tool (preferred tool). Reports can be done via the devices too. These reports are processed and approved/rejected by TomTom staff members and the end products are synchronized via the TomTom support applications, such as TomTom Home for the NAV2 devices and MyDrive Connect for the NAV3 and NAV4 devices. These support applications are available for Windows or Mac OS X based computers.\n\nMaps are not universally compatible across TomTom devices; while most maps are available for most modern devices, a compatible version must be used. Version numbers have a three-digit number identifying the major version, a dot, then a four-digit build number. Major version v940, for example, is available for most regions and most devices, but different builds are available for different regions and devices and supporting different features. The support applications ensure that the correct map version is assigned for download. For NAV2 devices one has to purchase the map via the TomTom Home support application and for NAV3 and NAV4 devices, one has to obtain the updates via the TomTom webshop.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn April 2011, TomTom \"apologized for supplying driving data collected from customers to police to use in catching speeding motorists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/27/tomtom_customer_data_flap/|title=TomTom Sorry for Giving Customer Driving Data to Cops|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=The Register}}</ref> The company had collected data from its Dutch customers which Dutch police subsequently used to set targeted speed traps.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|title=TomTom Admits Police Used Data for Speed Traps|first=Toby|last=Sterling|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-10|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003501/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|archivedate=2011-05-01}}</ref> As a result of this, TomTom was investigated by the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]], who found that TomTom had not contravened the {{ill|Dutch Data Protection Act|nl|Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens}}.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tomtom-idUSTRE80B0HN20120112</ref>\n\nIn 2011, TomTom improved the clarity of its explanation of how it uses the data it collects from its customers.<ref>http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/tomtom-cleared-in-dutch-data-privacy-investigation/</ref><ref>https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/news/following-report-dutch-dpa-tomtom-provides-user-better-information</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the company announced that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Australian [[Roads and Traffic Authority]], which could also potentially be used for targeted speed enforcement.<ref name=outrage>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/cartech/outrage-over-tomtom-speed-traps-for-motorists-20110506-1ebc2.html|title=Outrage Over TomTom Speed Traps for Motorists|first=Asher|last=Moses|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nThe privacy implications of this announcement were widely reported, particularly the lack of anonymity and the potential to associate the data with individuals. The company's practice of selling its user data has been criticised by [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]].

A few years ago truck maps were available to NAV2 models too.\n* '''TomTom Via''' \u2013 middle class GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. All the TomTom Via models belong to the NAV3 range.\n* '''TomTom Start''' \u2013 an entry-level GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]], but usually a lower HW specification, compared to the Via and Go models. Some models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. The TomTom Start models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom One and One XL''' \u2013 The TomTom One is the base model for [[automotive navigation system|automobile navigation]]. The difference between the TomTom One XL and the TomTom One is the size of the touch screen (4.3 vs 3.5&nbsp;in or 110 vs 89&nbsp;mm).  Neither model of the One contains the added functions included in the Go models, such as Bluetooth hands-free calling and MP3 Jukebox.  However, the One is able to receive traffic and weather updates using the TomTom Plus service when paired via Bluetooth with a mobile phone with a DUN data service.  The reduced software capability means less demand on the hardware, which allows the One to be sold at a significantly lower price than the Go. The ''XL'' is also available as a ''Live'' version with integrated Live Services.\n* '''TomTom Rider''' \u2013 Portable water-resistant models for [[motorcycle]] and [[motorscooter]] users. They differ from other devices in that the Rider is partly shielded and has a 'glove-friendly' screen and GUI. There are many different models in the NAV2 and NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Navigator''' \u2013 a GPS navigation software product for [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[Palm (device)|Palm]] devices, [[Pocket PC]]s, and some smartphones. TomTom Navigator 6 replaced the earlier TomTom Mobile 5.2. It can use GPS receivers built into the device or external (e.g., Bluetooth-connected) receivers. Navigator 7 was the latest release of this software, released as a part of the software that came with the June 2008 HTC Touch Diamond. Frequently used functions can be added to the main screen of the program, and users can report map corrections and share them with other users. Navigator supports touch screens; devices without touch screens use a cursor to input data.  The software is available on SD card and DVD. It runs on a number of devices listed on the TomTom website, but will run successfully on many unlisted devices using the [[Windows Mobile]] [[operating system]], discontinued in 2010. The DVD version includes a DVD, printed 15-character product code, Quick Start Guide, Licensing Agreement, a poster with a picture diagram for setup procedure of DVD version and SD card version, and an advertisement for associated TomTom Plus services.  The DVD contains installation software for [[TomTom Home]], software for mobile devices, licenses, manuals, maps, and voices.  The software for mobile devices includes CAB files for Palm, PPC, Symbian, and UIQ3.<ref>The container states that this product is compatible with: ACER N310-B, N311-BW, N35, N50; Asus MyPal A632N, MyPal A636N; Dell AXIM X51, Axim X51v; Eten M600; Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX 720, Pocket LOOX N520; HP iPAQ h1450, h4350, hw6510, hw6515, hw6910, hw6915, hx2190, hx2490, rx1950, rz1710; i-Mate JAM, JAMin, PDA-N, PDA2k; Mio 168, A201, A701, P350; Nokia E50, E61, N80; O2 XDA Exec; Orange SPV M1000, SPV M2000, SPV M3000; Palm Treo 700W, Treo 650; Qtek G100, S100, S110, 9000; T-Mobile MDA compact, MDA III, MDA Pro. {{cite book|publisher=TomTom|title=NAVIGATOR 6 DVD|format=software package|id= article no. 1T90.080, part no. 1T90.080S}}</ref>\n*'''TomTom for iOS''' \u2013 GPS navigation software product for [[iOS]] devices, originally announced for the [[iPhone]] at the Apple [[WWDC]] Keynote speech in early June 2009, and released internationally on 15 August 2009 in the Apple App Store, with various map packs for different regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=326055452 |title=TomTom for iPhone |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> TomTom Vice President of Marketing Development gave information in an interview by [[Macworld]] in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141539/2009/07/tomtomiphoneupdate.html |title=TomTom for iPhone en route &#124; Software &#124; iPhone Central |publisher=Macworld |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> Currently the app works with iPhone (all models), the iPod Touch (all models) and the iPad (all models), however Apple dropped the support for the early models and latest versions of the TomTom iOS app might have issues on certain devices.

Turkey and Greece were not included in the larger ''Europe'' map pack; this is related to the AppStore's app size limitation of 2 GB. These maps are available separately. Iceland is not available in any map package sold by TomTom at the moment, but they are working on it (and a few other countries too). Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available, based on the NavKit, which might cure the issue with the size limit (also Apple increased the app size limit to 4GB).\n*'''TomTom Go Mobile''', GPS navigation software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It replaced the old app, which had similar features to the iOS app. In March 2015, TomTom announced the new TomTom GO Mobile app for Android with a freemium subscription model for maps with the first 50 miles/75 kilometres per month being free, including all the maps that are available, TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. The previous app, which had promised \"free lifetime updates\", is not available for purchase on [[Play Store]] anymore and its maps are not updated since October 2015. TomTom claims their definition of lifetime map updates is \"the period of time that TomTom continues to support the app with updates\". Previous customers of TomTom's Android navigation app are offered a discount on the subscription in the new app for three years. There is no provision for users who want to keep using the old app under the conditions it was sold with lifetime map updates.\n*'''TomTom Speed Cameras''', a mobile software application released in 2015 free of charge.<ref>https://recombu.com/cars/article/tomtom-speed-cameras-app-to-keep-you-on-the-right-side-of-the-law</ref>\n\nNavigation software for several mobile phones discontinued after release 5.2; Navigator, which does not support all the phones that Mobile did, is the nearest equivalent. Mobile 5.2 cannot use maps later than v6.60 build 1223; this and earlier program versions are not compatible with all map versions, particularly other builds of version 6.\n\nIn September 2012, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] collaborated with TomTom to provide mapping data for its revamped iOS 6 updated [[Apple Maps]] app.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/tomtom-confirmed-as-official-partner-for-ios-6-maps-1084678|title=TomTom confirmed as official partner for iOS 6 Maps|work=TechRadar|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}</ref> The partnership was in part due to Apple's decision to wean itself off the products of its competitor, [[Google]]. As of 2018 TomTom continues to provide data for Apple Maps.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-tomtom/apple-rebuilds-mapping-app-but-will-still-tap-tomtom-idUSKBN1JP32S</ref>\n\n==TomTom Home and MyDrive Connect==\nTomTom Home (stylized as TomTom HOME) is a 32-bit PC application that allows synchronization/updates to be sent to the mobile device. The container states that it is compatible with Mac OS X v10.3 or greater and Windows ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (see above reference). After installation, it has options to choose a device to be associated to and activate the software.  A caution is given that the software only allows one device to be associated to an email address and the associated device can be changed only after 14 days since the previous association. TomTom Home version 2.0 and above is implemented on the [[XULRunner]] platform. With version 2.2, TomTom Home added a content-sharing platform where users can download and upload content to personalize their device such as voices, start-up images, [[Point of Interest|POI]] sets, etc. At the moment TomTom Home is on version 2.9.\n\nDespite being based on the cross-platform XULRunner, TomTom Home lacks support for Linux (and most probably it won't ever support, as the NAV2 devices are mostly legacy models by now).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/home|title=TomTom HOME software downloads page|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724234645/http://www.tomtom.com/home/|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is, for instance, impossible to update the maps in these devices by connecting them to another machine running Linux, even when using a common web browser like Firefox that normally allowed such an update under Microsoft Windows. \nHowever, the devices can still be read in a Linux OS as a disk drive. There is even software made by the community to manage some functions of\nthe TomTom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pytomtom.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page|title=pyTOMTOM}}</ref>\n\nThe NAV3 and NAV4 range of models use MyDrive Connect. MyDrive Connect is compatible with 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 preview and with most Mac OS X versions. The internal flash memory or the memory card content of the device cannot be accessed through USB for security reasons (modified applications would easily accept a map that wasn't sold by TomTom). The device can update itself by getting files through the HTTP protocol over USB. The support app is nothing more than a proxy on the PC buffering the download. So far the security achieved using this mechanism has not been broken yet. Also, the usage of the non-FAT/FAT32 file system brought stability improvements in device operations. On the downside, some users might experience compatibility issues between their PC, device and the MyDrive Connect support application. For those issues, TomTom Customer Services or members of the community forum are usually able to provide solutions.\n\n==TomTom built-in navigation==\nTomTom partners with several car manufacturers and offers built-in navigation solutions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Currently, the fees are only for European countries.\n\nTraffic data is also available to subscribers in many parts of Europe and the US via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled cell phone with Internet service or an add-on aerial, which picks up [[Traffic Message Channel|RDS]] data (broadcast on [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio frequencies) offering traffic information without the requirement for a data connection.  The TomTom Plus service is not compatible with Apple's [[iPhone]].\n\n===TomTom Live Services===\nIn October 2008 the company released Live Services on the Go 940 Live. These allowed users to receive updates over the mobile telephone network using the SIM card in the device. These services included HD Traffic, Safety Alerts, Local Search with Google and Fuel Prices.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, TomTom announced that it was offering up its real-time traffic products to \"industry partners\" in the United States.<ref>Don Reisinger, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20062210-17.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 TomTom offering real-time traffic data to partners].\" 12 May 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2011.</ref>\n\nOn the latest NAV4 devices the service is not available anymore in the old form. The included services had been separated and now being called TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. On the x0/x00/x000 devices the traffic service is free of charge either via the built-in SIM (Always Connected models) or via a compatible smartphone (Smartphone Connected or BYOD \u2013 Bring Your Own Device). The speed camera service is free for three months on these models. However, there is a newer range, the x10/x100 models, which come now with free lifetime speed camera subscription too.\n\n===Map Share===\nMap Share is a proprietary map technology launched by TomTom in June 2007.  Map Share allows users to make changes to the maps on their navigation devices and share them with others. It allows drivers to make changes to their maps directly on their navigation devices. Drivers can block or unblock streets, change the direction of traffic, edit street names and add, edit or remove points of interest (POIs). Improvements can be shared with other users through TomTom HOME, TomTom's content management software.\n\nAn online version called Map Share Reporter is on the TomTom website.\n\n===TomTom Traffic (previously HD Traffic)===\nA traffic monitoring service that uses multiple sources to provide traffic information. The service does this by combining data from:\n* traditional sources: governmental/third-party data such as induction loops in the roads, cameras and traffic surveillance\n* new sources: traffic flow of millions of anonymous mobile phone users<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/services/service.php?id=2&tab=4|title=TomTom HD Traffic \u2013 How it works}}</ref>\n\nThe information is merged by TomTom and algorithms are used to improve the data and filter out anomalous readings. The system sends updates to all TomTom Traffic users every two minutes (and the data the users receive is never older than 30 seconds). Users can receive the service through the built-in SIM, via a smartphone connection or on older devices via a standard phone connection. Re-routing can be set to be transparent to the user with the only sign that the route has been changed due to a traffic jam being a sound indication from the device and a changed {{abbr|ETA|estimated time of arrival}}.\n\nThe system was first launched in the Netherlands in 2007 and expanded to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland in 2008. By mid-2011, TomTom Live services including TomTom Traffic are available in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand and the following seventeen European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. {{Asof|2015}}, the service is vastly expanded and current coverage is available on the TomTom Traffic site (34 countries {{asof|2015|06|26|lc=on}} and the list expands every few months to new regions).\n\n'''TomTom Traffic improvements'''\n*''HD Traffic 6.0'' (August 2012): More accurate location of traffic jams, improved coverage of automatically detected road closures\n*''TomTom Traffic 7.0'' (September 2013): Increased accuracy of jam location now allows for 'Jam Ahead Warnings', warning drivers when approaching a jam-tail too fast. Improved coverage of automatic road closure detection started to include also major secondary roads. Automatic road works detection on highways. TomTom also added 'Predictive Flow Feed' for better predicting approaching traffic delays, with the goal of improving optimal route calculation and ETA.\n*''TomTom Traffic 8.0'' (November 2014): TomTom included real-time weather information in their routing algorithms, and warns users in areas of bad weather. Also, version 8.0 now incorporates in their real-time traffic information road closures that are reported via the online Map Share Reporter tool.\n\n===IQ Routes===\nIQ Routes, developed by TomTom and available since spring 2008 on the TomTom Go 730 and Go 930, uses anonymous travel time data accumulated by users of TomTom satnav devices. Newer TomTom devices use this data to take into account the time and day when determining the fastest route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloginfomanage.blogspot.com/2008/01/tomtom-collecting-data-from-gps-systems.html|title=Information Management: TomTom collecting data from GPS Systems}}</ref>\n\nTravel time data is stored in Historical Speed Profiles, one for each road segment, covering large motorways, main roads and also small local roads. Historic Speed Profiles are part of the digital map and are updated with every new map release. They give insight into real-world traffic patterns. This is a fact-based routing system based on measured travel times, compared to most other methods which use speed limits or \u2018assumed\u2019 speeds.\n\nIn September 2008, map upgrade v8.10 was released for x20 series models, extending the IQ Routes feature to those devices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |title=(click on \"show detailed map information\") |publisher=Tomtom.com |accessdate=2010-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126181249/http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with a free software update using TomTom Home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.support.tomtom.com/cgi-bin/tomtom_uk.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=9552|title=TomTom FAQs \u2013 IQ Routes|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>\n\nOn the NAV3 and NAV4 models the IQ Routes feature is available by default on all map versions.\n\n===Enhanced Positioning Technology===\nOffers continuous navigation, even when a navigation device can't receive GPS satellite signals (e.g. in tunnels or amongst high buildings) using [[Accelerometer|movement and gravity sensors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=318538|title=TomTom introduces New High-End Model: TomTom GO 920 (AMS:TOMTOM)|website=corporate.tomtom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref>\n\n===Mapping===\nTomTom products use [[Tele Atlas]] based maps. Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight and the TomTom Map Share Reporter Tool (preferred tool). Reports can be done via the devices too. These reports are processed and approved/rejected by TomTom staff members and the end products are synchronized via the TomTom support applications, such as TomTom Home for the NAV2 devices and MyDrive Connect for the NAV3 and NAV4 devices. These support applications are available for Windows or Mac OS X based computers.\n\nMaps are not universally compatible across TomTom devices; while most maps are available for most modern devices, a compatible version must be used. Version numbers have a three-digit number identifying the major version, a dot, then a four-digit build number. Major version v940, for example, is available for most regions and most devices, but different builds are available for different regions and devices and supporting different features. The support applications ensure that the correct map version is assigned for download. For NAV2 devices one has to purchase the map via the TomTom Home support application and for NAV3 and NAV4 devices, one has to obtain the updates via the TomTom webshop.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn April 2011, TomTom \"apologized for supplying driving data collected from customers to police to use in catching speeding motorists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/27/tomtom_customer_data_flap/|title=TomTom Sorry for Giving Customer Driving Data to Cops|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=The Register}}</ref> The company had collected data from its Dutch customers which Dutch police subsequently used to set targeted speed traps.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|title=TomTom Admits Police Used Data for Speed Traps|first=Toby|last=Sterling|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-10|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003501/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|archivedate=2011-05-01}}</ref> As a result of this, TomTom was investigated by the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]], who found that TomTom had not contravened the {{ill|Dutch Data Protection Act|nl|Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens}}.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tomtom-idUSTRE80B0HN20120112</ref>\n\nIn 2011, TomTom improved the clarity of its explanation of how it uses the data it collects from its customers.<ref>http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/tomtom-cleared-in-dutch-data-privacy-investigation/</ref><ref>https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/news/following-report-dutch-dpa-tomtom-provides-user-better-information</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the company announced that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Australian [[Roads and Traffic Authority]], which could also potentially be used for targeted speed enforcement.<ref name=outrage>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/cartech/outrage-over-tomtom-speed-traps-for-motorists-20110506-1ebc2.html|title=Outrage Over TomTom Speed Traps for Motorists|first=Asher|last=Moses|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nThe privacy implications of this announcement were widely reported, particularly the lack of anonymity and the potential to associate the data with individuals. The company's practice of selling its user data has been criticised by [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]]. David Vaile of the University of New South Wales' Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre has called for an independent technical analysis of the company's data collection practices. TomTom navigation devices collect user data that includes point of origin, point of destination, journey times, speeds and routes taken. The [[Australian Privacy Foundation]] said it would be easy to trace the data back to individual customers, even if TomTom claimed it used only aggregated, anonymous data.<ref name=outrage /><ref name=peeping>{{cite web|url= http://www.afr.com/technology/peeping-tomtom-sells-your-every-move-20110505-ietht|title=Peeping TomTom sells your every move|publisher=Australian Financial Review|date=6 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nTomTom VP of Marketing Chris Kearney insisted the information was totally anonymous.

He is diagnosed with a rare medical disorder called [[Congenital insensitivity to pain]] and is tended to by the odd-couple combination of his father and his mischievous grandfather Ajoba. School life is difficult for a boy who doesn\u2019t get hurt and is picked on by bullies and, yet, Surya finds an unlikely ally in his neighbour, Supri. At home, Surya learns to tend to his own wounds and binges on a whole host of [[martial arts film]]s on VHS tapes thanks to his grandfather\u2019s unique tutelage. The one tape that mesmerizes young Surya is 100-man karate [[kumite]] fought by a mysterious one-legged man called Karate Mani. His first foray into vigilantism is to come to the aid of Supri against her abusive father, but that event leads to the family being evicted from the building they lived in, and Surya and Supri are estranged as children. They go their separate ways, each one finding purpose and mentorship in unusual circumstances.\nAjoba encourages Surya to pursue his passion secretly & Surya trains himself by watching VHS videos meanwhile, Supri is trained by Karate Mani whom she meets when she accidentally bumps into his scooter.\n\nAs an adult, Surya remains as dorky as he was as a child because his father will never let him leave the house. When his father finally agrees to let him outside, Surya finds a poster advertising his childhood idol Karate Mani. This poster leads him to the very building where he and Supri had been separated years ago, and it is Supri who is pasting the posters. Both of them don't recognize each other, but he is bedazzled when she fights off thugs to rescue a lady. Later, Surya visits the address mentioned on the poster to meet Karate Mani. He finds him knocked out by his evil twin Jimmy, and his assistant calls Supri to help him. They take him to a hospital, where only Supri and Surya are left when the rest of them leave. Later Supri is forcefully taken away from the hospital by her boyfriend Atul and Surya fails to understand why she didn't fight back. Mani recovers consciousness he escapes from the hospital, feeling that hospital will bill him a bomb for trivial treatment. Surya chases him and fights off the hospital staff who had come to capture him, and Mani is impressed with his skill and reveals his story.\n\nMani and Jimmy were trained by his father, a Karate trainer since they were kids. Mani showed that talent for martial arts and easily won the heart of his father, which made Jimmy jealous. One fine day Mani saves Jimmy from a speeding truck, sacrificing his leg in the process. This further elevates Mani in the eyes of his father, and Jimmy is further estranged. After the 100-man kumite, his father gifts him his locket, whereas Jimmy takes up the path of crime. Once jailed for one of his crimes, Mani gets cozy with Jimmy's girlfriend, and Jimmy catches them red-handed in bed when he returns. This incident creates a permanent rift between the two, putting Mani in a guilt trap. Later Jimmy starts a security agency and bullies Mani with men and guns from his security agency, taking something from him each time he visits him, while Mani relents out of guilt.\n\nSupri later reveals that Atul won over her parents by taking care of their medical expenses, which sort of forced her to stay with him so that her mother would get adequate medical care. Atul is taking her family to Canada to treat her mother. Supri is falling into the same trap of family burden as her mother bore all her life with an abusive husband, so much so that she doesn't have time to think for herself and no clue of what she would do in life or what career she would pursue.\n\nOn his previous visit, Jimmy snatches the locket that was given by their father to Mani, and Surya vows to get it back for him. His grandfather tries to dissuade him as it is too dangerous but eventually gives in when he realises that he should not kill this very motivating factor. When Surya meets Mani, he refuses to take him to Jimmy but when Surya stops at nothing he accompanies him to Jimmy's office. Meanwhile at the airport just before boarding their flight to Canada, Supri's mother insists that she run away from Atul so that she doesn't go through the same fate of an overbearing husband. She hatches a plan wherein she covers up for the absence of Supri inside the plane and falls unconscious with a heavy dose of insulin once the plane lands in Canada, and once unconscious at the airport she has to be admitted to hospital to be treated. Supri leaves after some pushing from her mother and goes straight to Jimmy's office, knowing Surya would create some ruckus there. At Jimmy's office, a fight ensues between his staff and the two. Surya easily thrashes most of them and they are surprised to find that Surya doesn't experience the pain, which makes him more lethal. In the ensuing fight, fire is triggered and the staff lock them in a room and escape from the building. Supri enters in a nick of time and rescues them. They later take refuge at their old residential complex, where they had spent their childhood, which is deserted for reconstruction, and Ajoba gets them all the essentials like blankets and food.\n\nEarly in the morning, they are all captured by Jimmy, and he arranges a cruel game, where each one of them has to fight his staff members one-on-one. The first up is Mani, followed by Supri, Surya, and Ajoba. Supri and Mani knock down a quite a few men before going down. All of them attack Surya barring one, and Surya knocks them all out. Jimmy then sends his last remaining fighter: his best one. Just to quickly end the contest, he changes the rules: a 10 point match where a point is scored with every hit. Surya is injured when his foot is fractured by his opponent. Mani throws his crutch for help. Surya decides that it is time to break the rule and hits his opponent close to the eye with the crutch temporarily blinding him and finishes off the match. Jimmy is enraged at this, and he shoots and stabs him. Supri intervenes, snatches the gun and shoots Jimmy dead.\n\nLater Surya wakes up at his home, turned hospital. Supri and Ajoba are next to him. Mani is revealed to be in jail, who owns up to the murder of Jimmy. Surya goes on to fulfill his father's aspiration to become an accountant. Supri's mother gets treated in Canada. Now liberated from the burden of her mother's treatment, she finally starts thinking of her own self and starts focusing on her career.\n\n==Cast==\n* Abhimanyu Dassani as Surya Sampat\n** Sartaaj Kakkar as Young Surya\n* [[Radhika Madan]] as Supriya aka Supri\n** Riva Arora as Young Supri\n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Karate Mani and Jimmy\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Aajoba (grandpa)\n* [[Jimit Trivedi]] as Jatin Sampat\n* [[Shweta Basu Prasad]] as Aai (mother)\n* Prateek Parmar as Samurai (baby face)\n* Nishad Rana as Supri's Father\n* Lovleen Mishra as Supri's Mother\n* [[Elena Kazan]] as Nandini/Bridget Von Hammersmark\n* Satyajit Ganu as Atul\n\n==Production==\nDirector Vasan Bala said that in early 2016, a friend of his told him about a dentist whose patient did not ask for anaesthesia.

He is diagnosed with a rare medical disorder called [[Congenital insensitivity to pain]] and is tended to by the odd-couple combination of his father and his mischievous grandfather Ajoba. School life is difficult for a boy who doesn\u2019t get hurt and is picked on by bullies and, yet, Surya finds an unlikely ally in his neighbour, Supri. At home, Surya learns to tend to his own wounds and binges on a whole host of [[martial arts film]]s on VHS tapes thanks to his grandfather\u2019s unique tutelage. The one tape that mesmerizes young Surya is 100-man karate [[kumite]] fought by a mysterious one-legged man called Karate Mani. His first foray into vigilantism is to come to the aid of Supri against her abusive father, but that event leads to the family being evicted from the building they lived in, and Surya and Supri are estranged as children. They go their separate ways, each one finding purpose and mentorship in unusual circumstances.\nAjoba encourages Surya to pursue his passion secretly & Surya trains himself by watching VHS videos meanwhile, Supri is trained by Karate Mani whom she meets when she accidentally bumps into his scooter.\n\nAs an adult, Surya remains as dorky as he was as a child because his father will never let him leave the house. When his father finally agrees to let him outside, Surya finds a poster advertising his childhood idol Karate Mani. This poster leads him to the very building where he and Supri had been separated years ago, and it is Supri who is pasting the posters. Both of them don't recognize each other, but he is bedazzled when she fights off thugs to rescue a lady. Later, Surya visits the address mentioned on the poster to meet Karate Mani. He finds him knocked out by his evil twin Jimmy, and his assistant calls Supri to help him. They take him to a hospital, where only Supri and Surya are left when the rest of them leave. Later Supri is forcefully taken away from the hospital by her boyfriend Atul and Surya fails to understand why she didn't fight back. Mani recovers consciousness he escapes from the hospital, feeling that hospital will bill him a bomb for trivial treatment. Surya chases him and fights off the hospital staff who had come to capture him, and Mani is impressed with his skill and reveals his story.\n\nMani and Jimmy were trained by his father, a Karate trainer since they were kids. Mani showed that talent for martial arts and easily won the heart of his father, which made Jimmy jealous. One fine day Mani saves Jimmy from a speeding truck, sacrificing his leg in the process. This further elevates Mani in the eyes of his father, and Jimmy is further estranged. After the 100-man kumite, his father gifts him his locket, whereas Jimmy takes up the path of crime. Once jailed for one of his crimes, Mani gets cozy with Jimmy's girlfriend, and Jimmy catches them red-handed in bed when he returns. This incident creates a permanent rift between the two, putting Mani in a guilt trap. Later Jimmy starts a security agency and bullies Mani with men and guns from his security agency, taking something from him each time he visits him, while Mani relents out of guilt.\n\nSupri later reveals that Atul won over her parents by taking care of their medical expenses, which sort of forced her to stay with him so that her mother would get adequate medical care. Atul is taking her family to Canada to treat her mother. Supri is falling into the same trap of family burden as her mother bore all her life with an abusive husband, so much so that she doesn't have time to think for herself and no clue of what she would do in life or what career she would pursue.\n\nOn his previous visit, Jimmy snatches the locket that was given by their father to Mani, and Surya vows to get it back for him. His grandfather tries to dissuade him as it is too dangerous but eventually gives in when he realises that he should not kill this very motivating factor. When Surya meets Mani, he refuses to take him to Jimmy but when Surya stops at nothing he accompanies him to Jimmy's office. Meanwhile at the airport just before boarding their flight to Canada, Supri's mother insists that she run away from Atul so that she doesn't go through the same fate of an overbearing husband. She hatches a plan wherein she covers up for the absence of Supri inside the plane and falls unconscious with a heavy dose of insulin once the plane lands in Canada, and once unconscious at the airport she has to be admitted to hospital to be treated. Supri leaves after some pushing from her mother and goes straight to Jimmy's office, knowing Surya would create some ruckus there. At Jimmy's office, a fight ensues between his staff and the two. Surya easily thrashes most of them and they are surprised to find that Surya doesn't experience the pain, which makes him more lethal. In the ensuing fight, fire is triggered and the staff lock them in a room and escape from the building. Supri enters in a nick of time and rescues them. They later take refuge at their old residential complex, where they had spent their childhood, which is deserted for reconstruction, and Ajoba gets them all the essentials like blankets and food.\n\nEarly in the morning, they are all captured by Jimmy, and he arranges a cruel game, where each one of them has to fight his staff members one-on-one. The first up is Mani, followed by Supri, Surya, and Ajoba. Supri and Mani knock down a quite a few men before going down. All of them attack Surya barring one, and Surya knocks them all out. Jimmy then sends his last remaining fighter: his best one. Just to quickly end the contest, he changes the rules: a 10 point match where a point is scored with every hit. Surya is injured when his foot is fractured by his opponent. Mani throws his crutch for help. Surya decides that it is time to break the rule and hits his opponent close to the eye with the crutch temporarily blinding him and finishes off the match. Jimmy is enraged at this, and he shoots and stabs him. Supri intervenes, snatches the gun and shoots Jimmy dead.\n\nLater Surya wakes up at his home, turned hospital. Supri and Ajoba are next to him. Mani is revealed to be in jail, who owns up to the murder of Jimmy. Surya goes on to fulfill his father's aspiration to become an accountant. Supri's mother gets treated in Canada. Now liberated from the burden of her mother's treatment, she finally starts thinking of her own self and starts focusing on her career.\n\n==Cast==\n* Abhimanyu Dassani as Surya Sampat\n** Sartaaj Kakkar as Young Surya\n* [[Radhika Madan]] as Supriya aka Supri\n** Riva Arora as Young Supri\n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Karate Mani and Jimmy\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Aajoba (grandpa)\n* [[Jimit Trivedi]] as Jatin Sampat\n* [[Shweta Basu Prasad]] as Aai (mother)\n* Prateek Parmar as Samurai (baby face)\n* Nishad Rana as Supri's Father\n* Lovleen Mishra as Supri's Mother\n* [[Elena Kazan]] as Nandini/Bridget Von Hammersmark\n* Satyajit Ganu as Atul\n\n==Production==\nDirector Vasan Bala said that in early 2016, a friend of his told him about a dentist whose patient did not ask for anaesthesia.

In Zanzibar, Queen Sono (an undercover secret agent) is tasked with obtaining data about a private arms company called Superior Solutions from one of its senior operatives. When the initial plan to hack the data fails due to signal blocking technology, Queen resorts to stealing the required intel manually and engages in a fight with law enforcement operatives after being compromised. She manages to escape using a decoy and, together with her partner Fred, travels back to South Africa to report to their seniors at the Special Operations Group (SOG). There, she learns about a new terrorist group calling themselves the Watu Wema who plan to liberate Africa. Queen later has her friend and therapist William write her a complementary psychological evaluation at the request of her boss Sid. On the anniversary of her mother Safia's assassination, Queen meets with her grandmother Mazet and the two of them visit Safia's grave where a desolate Queen refuses to talk with her mother. In Congo, the Watu Wema appear at a slave mine and kill the guards and superiors, granting freedom to the enslaved miners. Shandu, Queen's ex and a former SOG agent is revealed as the leader of the terrorist group.

In Zanzibar, Queen Sono (an undercover secret agent) is tasked with obtaining data about a private arms company called Superior Solutions from one of its senior operatives. When the initial plan to hack the data fails due to signal blocking technology, Queen resorts to stealing the required intel manually and engages in a fight with law enforcement operatives after being compromised. She manages to escape using a decoy and, together with her partner Fred, travels back to South Africa to report to their seniors at the Special Operations Group (SOG). There, she learns about a new terrorist group calling themselves the Watu Wema who plan to liberate Africa. Queen later has her friend and therapist William write her a complementary psychological evaluation at the request of her boss Sid. On the anniversary of her mother Safia's assassination, Queen meets with her grandmother Mazet and the two of them visit Safia's grave where a desolate Queen refuses to talk with her mother. In Congo, the Watu Wema appear at a slave mine and kill the guards and superiors, granting freedom to the enslaved miners. Shandu, Queen's ex and a former SOG agent is revealed as the leader of the terrorist group.

She later visits him in prison and forces him to tell her what happened on the day of Safia's assassination. His story about shooting Safia as she sat on a park bench is revealed to be a lie when Queen recalls the shooter being in a moving car when she was five years old; revealing that Queen was there when her mother was shot.\n| LineColor       = 56CCDF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Dying Is Sore\n| DirectedBy      = Kagiso Lediga\n| WrittenBy       = Camilo Saloojee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|28}}\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

He spoke often about the generosity, tolerance, and compassion of Canadians, and admired the dignity and abilities of the common citizen.\n\nTo recognize the \"unsung heroes\" who volunteer their time and effort to help others, LeBlanc initiated in 1996 the [[Governor General's Caring Canadian Award]], and, on June 21, of the same year, was proud to issue a [[Proclamation|royal proclamation]] inaugurating [[National Aboriginal Day]] as an annual observance.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://archive.gg.ca/gg/fgg/bios/02/causes_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada|title=Governor General > Former Governors General > Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc > Personal Causes of the Rt.

He participated in more than 2,000 events, including the annual New Year's [[Lev\u00e9e (event)|Lev\u00e9e]], which he moved to various locations around the country, seeing the party organised at [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], in 1996; [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], in 1997; [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], in 1998; and [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in 1999.\n\nOver the same years, LeBlanc also had public access to Rideau Hall and [[Rideau Hall#Grounds|its grounds]] expanded and improved{{mdash}} including opening a dedicated visitors' centre in 1997{{mdash}} so that the number of visitors increased threefold to approximately 125,000 people per year.<ref name=GGHigh/> In keeping with his respect for the First Peoples of Canada, LeBlanc placed a totem pole and inukshuk prominently on the royal property.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAmongst numerous other official and ceremonial duties, the Governor General granted [[Royal Assent]] to amendments to [[Constitution of Canada|the constitution]] on three occasions: April 21, 1997, December 19, 1997, and January 8, 1998, and also issued the royal proclamation announcing the creation of the territory of [[Nunavut]] on April 1, 1999. LeBlanc welcomed to Rideau Hall the Queen, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]], along with a host of foreign dignitaries such as [[President of the United States|United States president]] [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]]; [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] and [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], and later Hussein's son, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]], and his wife [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania]]; as well as [[President of South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]]; and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President of China]] [[Jiang Zemin]].

As such, he was seen as a symbol for reconciliation, given the past relations between the Acadians and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Canadian Crown's predecessor]]. At the same time, LeBlanc was also credited for returning Rideau Hall to a status closer to that which it held a century previous, when it was the centre of life in the national capital.<ref name=CMNLeB />\n[[File:Flag of Canadian Governor General LeBlanc.svg|thumb|left|The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|Governor General's standard]] as redesigned at LeBlanc's direction, declawed and delangued]]\n\nAlthough LeBlanc enjoyed all the provinces and territories, his visits touching small towns as well as big cities, he travelled to events in his home province to a degree that some saw as disproportionate. Moreover, LeBlanc never sought media coverage, with the result that many Canadians were unaware of who he was, and his down-to-earth demeanour was thought by some to have been too \"folksy\" for the post.<ref name=CMNSun /> The accusations of political patronage also failed to evaporate during LeBlanc's governorship; while LeBlanc was viceroy, his son, [[Dominic LeBlanc|Dominic]], continued to work for the prime minister's office until 1997, when he ran for election to the House of Commons in LeBlanc's old riding, where the Governor General had a series of events planned the very week he dropped the [[Writ of election|election writs]]. Further, LeBlanc's daughter maintained employment as a political assistant to Liberal Cabinet ministers, and some of the Governor General's staff had close Liberal Party connections.<ref name=CMNLeB />\n\nPersonal touches were also left on [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|the symbol of the Canadian viceregal office]], from which LeBlanc removed the claws and tongue of the crowned lion,<ref name=CMNSun /> saying that they were impolite and un-Canadian.

Moreover, LeBlanc never sought media coverage, with the result that many Canadians were unaware of who he was, and his down-to-earth demeanour was thought by some to have been too \"folksy\" for the post.<ref name=CMNSun /> The accusations of political patronage also failed to evaporate during LeBlanc's governorship; while LeBlanc was viceroy, his son, [[Dominic LeBlanc|Dominic]], continued to work for the prime minister's office until 1997, when he ran for election to the House of Commons in LeBlanc's old riding, where the Governor General had a series of events planned the very week he dropped the [[Writ of election|election writs]].

After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded after lead vocalist Sandman died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] onstage in [[Palestrina]], Italy, on July 3, 1999. Founding members have reformed into the band [[Vapors of Morphine]], maintaining much of the original style and sound.\n\nMorphine combined [[blues]] and [[jazz]] elements with more traditional [[rock music|rock]] arrangements, giving the band an unusual sound. Sandman sang distinctively in a \"deep, laid-back [[croon]]\",<ref>{{cite news | title = Morphine's addictive music is seducing a phalanx of fans | author = Matt Ashare | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | newspaper = [[The Boston Phoenix]] | date = 1994-05-27 | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132754/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | archivedate = 2008-05-15 }}</ref> and his songwriting featured a prominent [[Beat generation|beat]] influence. The band themselves coined the label \"low rock\" to describe their music, which involved \"a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a '[[power trio]]' not built around the sound of an [[electric guitar]]. Instead, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Morphine discography | author = Greg Kot | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=morphine | publisher = TrouserPress.com | date =  | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially.  In the United States the band was embraced and promoted by the [[indie rock]] community, including [[National Public Radio|public]] and [[campus radio|college]] radio stations and [[MTV]]'s ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which the band once guest-hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and [[Australia]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation, independent years (1989\u20131996)===\nMorphine was formed in 1989 by bassist and vocalist Mark Sandman, a member of the bluesy alternative rock band [[Treat Her Right]], saxophonist Dana Colley, a former member of the local Boston group Three Colors, and drummer Jerome Deupree, who had played with Sandman in the Hypnosonics.  Sandman, a prolific musician who frequently experimented with home-made instruments, played a single-stringed bass guitar of his own devising with a [[slide guitar|slide]], although he later added a second string.  Deupree briefly left the group for health reasons in 1991 and was temporarily replaced by Treat Her Right drummer [[Billy Conway (drummer)|Billy Conway]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=873}}</ref>  These years found the group building a strong local audience and touring occasionally.\n\nWith Deupree returning, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Good (Morphine album)|Good]]'', for the Boston-based Accurate/Distortion label in 1991.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album received positive reviews and increased the band's audience. The band subsequently signed to [[Rykodisc]], who re-released ''Good'' under its own imprint.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| page= 661| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n''[[Cure for Pain]]'', 1993's followup,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> increased the band's audience outside of [[New England]], and singles like \"Thursday\" and \"Buena\" picked up some college radio play.  During the recording of ''Cure for Pain'', Deupree was again replaced by Conway, although Deupree still played most of the percussion work on the album.  After the album was completed, the band toured the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1994, the songs \"Sheila\" and \"In Spite of Me\" were prominently featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]''.  The band returned to the studio in 1995 and produced ''[[Yes (Morphine album)|Yes]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album featured the single \"Honey White,\" the music video for which appeared on the [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.\n\n===DreamWorks Records years (1997\u20131999)===\nAfter two years of touring, Morphine signed with [[DreamWorks Records]], who released their major label debut, ''[[Like Swimming]]'', in 1997.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It was a critical success, but did not break the band into the domestic mainstream as had been hoped. DreamWorks released a music video for the single \"Early to Bed\"; directed by [[Jamie Caliri]] and released in March 1997, the nightmarish yet humorous video became an instant favorite among fans and was later nominated for a [[Grammy awards|Grammy award]].  The band also released ''[[B-Sides and Otherwise]]'', a collection of B-sides and live recordings, on Rykodisc this same year.\n\nIn the following time, Deupree once again began performing live and in the studio with the band, making the group a four-piece.  The band's final studio album, ''[[The Night (Morphine album)|The Night]]'', was completed in early 1999.\n\nOn July 3, 1999, Sandman collapsed on the stage of the [[:it:Nel Nome del Rock|Nel Nome del Rock]] festival at the Giardini del Principe in [[Palestrina]], [[Italy]], outside of [[Rome]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> He was soon pronounced dead of a heart attack and Morphine immediately disbanded. ''The Night'' was released in 2000.  Posthumous Morphine releases followed shortly thereafter, including ''[[Bootleg Detroit]]'', an \"official live bootleg\", and ''[[The Best of Morphine: 1992\u20131995]]'', both on Rykodisc.\n\n===Posthumous projects (1999\u2013present)===\n[[File:Dana Colley in BA - 2011.jpg|thumb|180px|Dana Colley performing with the posthumous Members of Morphine project in 2011]]\nWithin a year of Sandman's death, Colley and Conway created '''Orchestra Morphine''', a group of Sandman's friends and colleagues who toured to celebrate the music of the band and to raise funds for the Mark Sandman Music Education Fund. Orchestra Morphine mostly performed music from ''The Night'', but also included some other Morphine and Hypnosonics material as well.  Orchestra Morphine still performs occasionally but no longer tours.  Singer and guitarist [[Laurie Sargent]], a member of Orchestra Morphine and former vocalist for the band [[Face to Face (new wave band)|Face to Face]], later joined Colley and Conway in their first post-Morphine musical endeavor, [[Twinemen]].\n\nConway and Colley also officially formed the [[Hi-n-Dry]] [[independent record label]] and studio, converting Sandman's workspace into a commercial enterprise. The label's roster includes a number of their friends, colleagues and other Boston-area musicians.  In 2004, Hi-n-Dry released the Mark Sandman box set ''Sandbox'', which contained two CDs and a DVD of previously unreleased material spanning Sandman's musical career. The DVD featured clips from early Sandman shows, interviews from the Morphine tours, and various videos from other Sandman solo and group projects, such as Treat Her Right. However, for copyright reasons the box set did not contain any previously released material found in the Morphine catalog, Morphine videos, or promotional material produced by Rykodisc or DreamWorks Records.\n\nDeupree continued to record with various jazz musicians.  \n\nIn 2009, Colley and Deupree began regularly performing Morphine songs and new material as '''Members of Morphine''' (alternately, the Ever-Expanding Elastic Waste Band), with singer, bassist and guitarist [[Jeremy Lyons]] of [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unity.edu/NewsEvents/News/UCCPAReunion609.aspx |title=Unity.edu |publisher=Unity.edu |accessdate=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720094425/http://www.unity.edu/NewsEvents/News/UCCPAReunion609.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-20 }}</ref>  In July 2009, the group played at Nel Nome Del Rock Festival in Palestrina, Italy, marking the ten-year anniversary of Sandman's death at the location in which it occurred.<ref>{{cite web|author=US |url=http://www.myspace.com/membersofmorphine |title=Myspace.com |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> As of 2014, the group was renamed [[Vapors of Morphine]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20140416/Entertainment/140417005 |newspaper=Patriot Ledger |author=Chad Berndtson |title=Vapors of Morphine makes it a point to keep the music fresh |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> and regularly performs in Boston and New Orleans, and holds a standing weekly gig at Atwood's Tavern in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/01/08/vapors-morphine-home-atwood-any-night/2DfssHaadUGocd8moJWJ4I/story.html|author=Sean L.

After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded after lead vocalist Sandman died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] onstage in [[Palestrina]], Italy, on July 3, 1999. Founding members have reformed into the band [[Vapors of Morphine]], maintaining much of the original style and sound.\n\nMorphine combined [[blues]] and [[jazz]] elements with more traditional [[rock music|rock]] arrangements, giving the band an unusual sound. Sandman sang distinctively in a \"deep, laid-back [[croon]]\",<ref>{{cite news | title = Morphine's addictive music is seducing a phalanx of fans | author = Matt Ashare | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | newspaper = [[The Boston Phoenix]] | date = 1994-05-27 | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132754/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/99/07/08/ASHARE_MAY_94.html | archivedate = 2008-05-15 }}</ref> and his songwriting featured a prominent [[Beat generation|beat]] influence. The band themselves coined the label \"low rock\" to describe their music, which involved \"a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a '[[power trio]]' not built around the sound of an [[electric guitar]]. Instead, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Morphine discography | author = Greg Kot | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=morphine | publisher = TrouserPress.com | date =  | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially.  In the United States the band was embraced and promoted by the [[indie rock]] community, including [[National Public Radio|public]] and [[campus radio|college]] radio stations and [[MTV]]'s ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which the band once guest-hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and [[Australia]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation, independent years (1989\u20131996)===\nMorphine was formed in 1989 by bassist and vocalist Mark Sandman, a member of the bluesy alternative rock band [[Treat Her Right]], saxophonist Dana Colley, a former member of the local Boston group Three Colors, and drummer Jerome Deupree, who had played with Sandman in the Hypnosonics.  Sandman, a prolific musician who frequently experimented with home-made instruments, played a single-stringed bass guitar of his own devising with a [[slide guitar|slide]], although he later added a second string.  Deupree briefly left the group for health reasons in 1991 and was temporarily replaced by Treat Her Right drummer [[Billy Conway (drummer)|Billy Conway]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=873}}</ref>  These years found the group building a strong local audience and touring occasionally.\n\nWith Deupree returning, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Good (Morphine album)|Good]]'', for the Boston-based Accurate/Distortion label in 1991.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album received positive reviews and increased the band's audience. The band subsequently signed to [[Rykodisc]], who re-released ''Good'' under its own imprint.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| page= 661| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n''[[Cure for Pain]]'', 1993's followup,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> increased the band's audience outside of [[New England]], and singles like \"Thursday\" and \"Buena\" picked up some college radio play.  During the recording of ''Cure for Pain'', Deupree was again replaced by Conway, although Deupree still played most of the percussion work on the album.  After the album was completed, the band toured the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1994, the songs \"Sheila\" and \"In Spite of Me\" were prominently featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]''.  The band returned to the studio in 1995 and produced ''[[Yes (Morphine album)|Yes]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album featured the single \"Honey White,\" the music video for which appeared on the [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.\n\n===DreamWorks Records years (1997\u20131999)===\nAfter two years of touring, Morphine signed with [[DreamWorks Records]], who released their major label debut, ''[[Like Swimming]]'', in 1997.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It was a critical success, but did not break the band into the domestic mainstream as had been hoped. DreamWorks released a music video for the single \"Early to Bed\"; directed by [[Jamie Caliri]] and released in March 1997, the nightmarish yet humorous video became an instant favorite among fans and was later nominated for a [[Grammy awards|Grammy award]].  The band also released ''[[B-Sides and Otherwise]]'', a collection of B-sides and live recordings, on Rykodisc this same year.\n\nIn the following time, Deupree once again began performing live and in the studio with the band, making the group a four-piece.  The band's final studio album, ''[[The Night (Morphine album)|The Night]]'', was completed in early 1999.\n\nOn July 3, 1999, Sandman collapsed on the stage of the [[:it:Nel Nome del Rock|Nel Nome del Rock]] festival at the Giardini del Principe in [[Palestrina]], [[Italy]], outside of [[Rome]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> He was soon pronounced dead of a heart attack and Morphine immediately disbanded. ''The Night'' was released in 2000.

Colley played primarily [[baritone saxophone]], along with soprano or tenor saxes, and the rare [[bass saxophone]], and he sometimes played two saxes at once, a la [[Roland Kirk]]; he also played occasional [[percussion]], and [[Dobro]] on a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Studio albums\n* ''[[Good (Morphine album)|Good]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Cure for Pain]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Yes (Morphine album)|Yes]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Like Swimming]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[The Night (Morphine album)|The Night]]'' (2000)\n\n;Live albums\n*''[[Bootleg Detroit]]'' (2000)\n\n;Compilations\n*''[[B-Sides and Otherwise]]'' (1997)\n*''[[The Best of Morphine: 1992-1995]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Sandbox: The Mark Sandman Box Set]]'' (2004)\n*''At Your Service'' (2009)\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Singles\n* \"Buena\" (1993)\n* \"Thursday\" (1993)\n* \"Sharks\" (1994)\n* \"Cure for Pain\" (1994)\n* \"Super Sex\" (1995)\n* \"Honey White\" (1995)\n* \"Early to Bed\" (1997)\n* \"[[Wild Things (film)|Murder for the Money]]\" (1997)\n* \"Eleven O'Clock\" (1999)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.lukin.com/tos/ The Other Side]\n* [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p11245|pure_url=yes}} Morphine data at AllMusic]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/twinemen Twinemen on Myspace]\n\n{{Morphine}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Alternative rock groups from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:American blues rock musical groups]]\n[[Category:American experimental musical groups]]\n[[Category:Indie rock musical groups from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1999]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1989]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:American musical trios]]\n[[Category:Rykodisc artists]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "186.84.90.133", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine_(band)"}
