All higher ranks are temporary ranks and linked to their specific commands or office and expire with the expiration of their term of command or office.\n\n<gallery>\nUSN-USMC O8 insignia.svg|U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, USPHSCC, NOAACOC shoulder insignia\nFile:USCG O-8 insignia.svg|The collar stars, shoulder boards, and sleeve stripes of a U.S. Coast Guard rear admiral\nFile:US PHS O8 insignia.svg|The collar stars, shoulder boards, and sleeve stripes of a U.S. Public Health Service rear admiral\nFile:US NOAA O8 insignia.svg|The collar stars, shoulder boards, and sleeve stripes of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rear admiral\nFile:Flag of a United States Coast Guard rear admiral.svg|[[Flag officer|Rank flag]] of a U.S. Coast Guard rear admiral\n</gallery>\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the [[American Civil War]], the American Navy had resisted creating the rank of admiral. Instead, they preferred the term \"[[flag officer]]\", in order to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. During the American Civil War, the US Congress honored [[David Glasgow Farragut]]'s successful assault on the city of New Orleans by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard both had a temporary one-star rank of commodore that was used in limited circumstances. By the end of the war, all incumbents had been advanced to the rank of two-star rear admiral and the commodore rank was eliminated in both services. Both the Navy and the Coast Guard divided their rear admirals into \"lower half\" and full rear admirals, or \"upper half\", the former being paid at the same rate as a one-star brigadier general in the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and the newly independent [[U.S. Air Force]]. Lower-half rear admirals were eventually promoted to full rear admirals, or upper half status, where they would receive pay equivalent to a two-star major general.  However, both categories of rear admiral wore two-star insignia, an issue that was a source of consternation to the other services.\n\nAt the same time, the Navy also bestowed the title of commodore on selected U.S. Navy captains who commanded multiple subordinate units, such as destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons and air wings and air groups not designated as carrier air wings or carrier air groups.  Although not [[flag officer]]s, these officers were entitled to a personal blue and white command pennant containing the initials, acronym abbreviation or numerical designation of their command.<ref>[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=commodore+pennant&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1440&bih=795&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=bSGywyKi1FYoFM:&imgrefurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/cmdpen.html&docid=nH6cBkqGfKw3UM&imgurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/usbrdcp.GIF&w=279&h=216&ei=WZGEUKOgJoq08ATvlYDYBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=624&vpy=311&dur=494&hovh=172&hovw=223&tx=71&ty=80&sig=116125559521526739827&page=1&tbnh=142&tbnw=184&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:92 Google Image Search]</ref>\n \nIn 1981, {{USPL|97|86}} expanded commodore from a title to an official permanent grade by creating the one-star rank of [[commodore admiral]].<ref name=\"rear admiral\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5501- 10 U.S.C. 5501 Notes]</ref> After only 11 months, the rank was reverted to just commodore but kept the one-star insignia.

Since then, rear admirals (lower half) wear one star while rear admirals wear two; verbal address remains \"rear admiral\" for both ranks. On correspondence, where the rear admiral's rank is spelled out, the acronym (LH) and (UH) follows the rear admiral's rank title to distinguish between one and two stars.\n\nBeginning around 2001, the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps started using the separate rank abbreviations RDML (one star) and RADM (two stars), while the Public Health Service continued to use the abbreviation RADM for both.<ref>[http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/uniforms.aspx About the Commissioned Corps Uniforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nAs flag officers, the flags flown for rear admirals of the unrestricted line of the U.S. Navy have one or two white, single-point-up stars on blue fields for the lower half or upper half, respectively. The flags of restricted line officers and staff corps officers have blue stars on a white field. All services officially list the two-star grade as rear admiral and not rear admiral (upper half) as stated by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8111}} and  {{UnitedStatesCode|37|201}} of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]].

Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once confirmed, a nominee is promoted once he or she assumes an office that requires or allows an officer to hold that rank. For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute.

By law, the Service has the same rank structure of the United States Coast Guard, but its uniforms are more similar to the United States Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 46 USC Subtitle V: Merchant Marine|url = http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle5&edition=prelim|website = uscode.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory limits ==\n\nU.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of flag officers that may be on active duty at any given time. The total number of active duty flag officers is capped at 162 for the Regular Navy,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/526- 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 526. Authorized strength: general and flag officers on active duty]</ref> augmented by a smaller number of additional flag officers in the Navy Reserve who are either on full-time active duty, temporary active duty, or on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) as part-time drilling reservists.  Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once confirmed, a nominee is promoted once he or she assumes an office that requires or allows an officer to hold that rank. For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute. For the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps, both grades of rear admiral are permanent ranks and do not expire when the officer vacates a one-star or two-star position. The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, however, employs permanent promotions in both grades of rear admiral as well as position-linked temporary appointments in both grades.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. 206(c)] Assignment of officers - Creation of temporary positions as Assistant Surgeons General</ref> Their temporary ranks expires when those officers vacate certain temporary positions of office designated to bear those ranks.\n\n== Tradition ==\nBy tradition in the United States Navy, when an officer is selected or appointed to flag rank, all current Navy flag officers write the selectee a letter congratulating him or her for attaining flag officer status.<ref>[http://downloads.feedroom.com/downloads/t_assets/pentagontv/20081030/MullenReal_oct29_Web_output_1_2YMQ.wmv The Pentagon Channel.mil: 28 Oct 2008 - Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, speech at Maxwell Gunter AFB, (69 minutes 37 seconds into the speech).

At first the men were separated from the women, but they later met in masquerade ball fashion show. There, they had to pick their partners and kiss them at the end of the runway. Notable scenes were Cory, who picked a guy instead of a girl as a partner, Chris H., who chose two female partners, and Bianca with Chlea, both of whom were left without a man to walk with.\n\nAfterwards, the models were interviewed individually. Jourdan revealed that she had married and divorced a man at the age of eighteen. Virgg talked about her being transgender, and that she had begun to take hormones in preparation for sex reassignment surgery. Mike confessed that he had been discovered by Tyra while working on an ice cream truck. Jeremy admitted that he had been chubby as a kid, but managed to overcome his struggles and become fit. Marvin talked about his home life, and about his father's profession as a janitor. Chris H. spoke about his experience of having been homeless. Later, all thirty-five semifinalists were driven to the top model house. There, the pool of contestants was narrowed down to twenty-six people who would spend the night there before the permanent and official cast was revealed.\n\nThe chosen twenty-six finalists moved into the top model home, where they would spend the night. Tyra and Rob dropped by in order to talk to the hopefuls about the different aspects of male and female modeling. Personalities clashed when playful Chris H., punched Phil in his groin area. He was quickly confronted by the other male models. Seeing this, Nina tried to comfort him and got to know him more.\n\nLater that night, the models were photographed so that they could earn the fan votes that would allow them into the final cast. Chris H. and Jourdan struggled during the beginning of the shoot, while others excelled. Back at the model house, Jourdan began to talk to Jeremy and told him that they were only friends. She also stated that she felt uncomfortable and slightly irritated with Jeremy following her around. Nina talked to Chris H. and tried to convince him to open up to more to the people there. Immediately before the final cast was going to be revealed, Virgg requested to speak to Tyra. She explained that the hormones were taking a toll on her, and as a result, she had decided to quit the competition.

Nina reveals she had part of her lungs removed due to inhaling an airborne fungus. At the sea runway, Jourdan, Renee and Chris did extremely well for the most part, while Marvin and Jeremy fell flat in convincing the designer by their walk. Nina broke down which frustrated Chris, after being told she cannot participate in the sea runway for her lung problem. As a result, she and Don who panicked under water and quickly bailed the runway, have to jump in the sea and pose while wearing snorkels, instead of walking with a helmet.

Don and Marvin landed in the bottom two both for the second time; Marvin, though praised for his charisma, produced another weak photo, and Don, for delivering an average photograph. In the end, Don was eliminated, who thought that he had a better picture than Chris.\n\n*'''Featured photographer:'''  Lennette Newell\n*'''Special guests:'''  Carole Lacroix, Laura Fuest\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 250\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = The Girl Who Gets Kissed on an Elephant\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|10|18}}\n| Viewers         = 1.10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/10/21/friday-final-tv-ratings-masterchef-junior-and-shark-tank-adjusted-up/210320/|title=Friday Final TV Ratings: 'MasterChef Junior' and 'Shark Tank' Adjusted Up|date=October 22, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The remaining models return to the hotel and were met in the living room by Tyra with candles and floor pillows. As the models talked about certain feelings and emotions like Jourdan brought her struggles in the past with her ex-husband, Chris also expressed his jealousy about the others' strong relationships and that he didn't have a close friend in the house which dismays Nina knowing that she had been Chris's closest friend and that he didn't feel the same.\n\nThe next day, while working out, Jeremy confronted Chris and recalled their past experiences while they were met in Bali. Jeremy pointed out that he was shown by Chris's lack of respect. Everyone in the house started listening to their drama while Nina was sleeping sound. The photoshoot came where they had to model designs by a deaf 11-year old designer, Rafi A. Ridwan and Oka Diputra in a Rice Paddy. The models showed their high-fashion abilities to Tyra for a 10-second pose teach. Jourdan, Cory and Marvin excelled and proved their modelling abilities in the shoot while Chris was criticized for being bad tempered and performing lackluster and Nina for not knowing to connect her body and face. Jeremy was told to not having the ability to work his body. Also, Renee was constantly told of her flat expression and inability to stand out.\n\nAfter the photoshoot, they head to [[Ubud]] into two teams in three, Chris, Cory, Nina and Renee went to a healing and cleansing trip while Jourdan, Jeremy and Marvin toured around [[Ubud Monkey Forest]]. They were housed to the elephant village where tensions rose again while the bed assignment was done. Chris felt he was not assigned properly which prompted Jeremy to be the mature one. Jourdan, Nina and Cory shared the big bed, Marvin and Renee shared the couches, Jeremy slept on the small couch on the room and Chris made his own. The next day, the models rode some elephants where Marvin and Renee; who have the nickname of \"Marnee\", kissed. They then went back to the hotel and were greeted by the skull Mail. Again, a 'no one is safe' letter was sent, leaving them guessing for a double elimination.\n\nAt panel, Jourdan, Marvin and Cory received praise for their high fashion editorial photographs while Renee, Jeremy, Chris and Nina received mixed feedback to weak. Having no challenge, this week would prove who delivered the best photo out of everyone else. Jourdan's photograph eventually won her fourth best photo in the competition. Nina, Chris and Jeremy were called for a double elimination; Chris, for not believing in his own abilities, Nina, for producing an average photo despite strong performances throughout the competition, and Jeremy, for still not mastering Head-to-toe modelling. In a shocking elimination, Nina was first to be eliminated, followed by Jeremy, and were both sent home, which dismayed everyone.\n\n*'''Featured Photographer:'''  [[Jez Smith]]\n*'''Special Guests:'''  Oka Diputra, Rafi A.

It was a battle within the sexes. Renee versus Jourdan and Chris, Marvin and Cory battled it out as well. Renee beat Jourdan and Marvin won over the guys. As a result, the two won the challenge and had the chance to appear in a fitness video with Laura and Rob. They were also rewarded with a spa treatment.\n\nAt the photo shoot, they were greeted by Johnny in a temple where they had to do shoot with Bats while suspended in the air upside-down. Jourdan started thinking about how the competition would affect Renee and Marvin if one of them got eliminated. Jourdan and Marvin excelled in the shoot and impressed Johnny and Jez the most. Chris's shoot had to take long before a great shot was produced. Cory was directed to not look to feminine in his face and body, while Renee didn't feel good and had her shoot end earlier.\n\nAt judging, Tyra announced that there would be a final double elimination which would help determine the final three. Jourdan wowed the judges with her stellar photo. Marvin also received great feedback. Renee was criticized for having produced an \"amateur\" photo. Chris's photo also dismayed the judges, while Cory created polarity amongst the judges at panel as well as in social media.\n\nAfter adding up all the scores, Jourdan received her fifth best picture during elimination, becoming the first finalist. She was commended by Tyra for having performed successfully throughout the competition. She proceeded to nickname her \"Sunrise Smize\". Marvin was called second and was also lauded for his journey. He received \"Booch Blue\" as his nickname. Cory, Chris and Renee were called forward for elimination. Renee had the lowest score and exited first. She was followed by Chris, who fell 1.5 points short to Cory and was eliminated.

Johnny has to meet them on-set, as their assumptions were proven correct when they were told that they would having a shoot for Guess. He introduced the models to Yu Tsai, their photographer for the shoot. Immediately before the shoot however, past contestants returned to assist the final three models.\n\nAll of the eliminated models (except Bianca Chris S and Alexandra.) have made an entrance wearing the color of the finalist they were supporting. Cory's team consist of Chlea, Jiana, Kanani and Nina. Marvin's team have supported four people: Don, Jeremy, Phil and Renee. Jourdan only received one supporter, Chris H. This left Mike to be part of Jourdan's team, Chris stressed that he picked Jourdan because he felt that Jourdan was ready to be a model. That night, the final three models had a chance to talk with their loved ones. Jourdan decided to call her boyfriend, Cory called his mom and Marvin talked with his father.\n\nThe second photo shoot of the week was for Nylon. Marvin Scott Jarrett shot the three models in different locations. He stressed his awe for the three models. He applauded Jourdan's striking performance, Marvin's drive and Cory's masculinity. After the shoot, the models had the chance to talk with Jarrett himself about their lives and journey in ''Top Model''. For the last challenge, the final three went to the site where the final runway show would be taking place. Executive Producers Ken Mok and Laura Fuest Silva are at the show where Ken and Laura explained as they would have to perform in a fashion feature, with the theme involving a 'love triangle' with an abusive relationship. Jourdan excelled after performing amazingly and believably. Jourdan and Cory had to kiss with each other, while Marvin felt a bit uneasy.\n\nThe eliminate models must have debated to switch teams, as a result, Mike left Corey's team and switch to Jourdan's team as he felt Jourdan looked like a more model. Twenty minutes before the show has begun, Tyra and the judges revealed a twist that there would be one final elimination before the fashion show. The judges deliberated on the models' Guess photos. Jourdan was praised for having produced a Guess-worthy photograph and having a great social media response for her \"booty tooch\", but they believed her photo not as strong as it could have been. Marvin was lauded for his cheekbones but Kelly said he was depending too much on his looks. Cory was noted to look very masculine but the Judges were not sure if he could be \"the man\". The judges said they had already scored the photos and the results were in, and that only two of them would continue on in the competition. The episode ended with a cliffhanger.\n\n*'''Featured Photographers:'''  Yu Tsai, Dinar Puspita Sari\n*'''Special Guests:''' Mrs. Maria, Laura James, Marvin Scott Jarrett, Ken Mok, Laura Fuest Silva\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 253\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = Finale Part 2: The Guy or Girl Who Becomes America's Next Top Model\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|15}}\n| Viewers         = 1.29<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/11/18/friday-final-ratings-hawaii-five-0-undercover-boss-grimm-last-man-standing-the-carrie-diaries-the-neighbors-adjusted-down/216297/|title=Friday Final Ratings: 'Hawaii Five-0', 'Undercover Boss', 'Grimm' & 'Raising Hope' Adjusted Up; 'Last Man Standing', 'The Carrie Diaries' & 'The Neighbors' Adjusted Down|date=November 18, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Concluded from the previous episode, Tyra and the judges have already made the decision, Jourdan and Marvin advanced into the top two and Cory was eliminated.

Immediately after this, the catwalk show began. Jourdan tripped with her stilettos on her gown leaving her on the verge of tears. Both Jourdan and Marvin wowed the judges with their performances.\n\nThe next day, Tyra visited the final two near the villa and told them that they would be having one final photo shoot, focusing on portraying feral and wild jungle creatures.

At first the men were separated from the women, but they later met in masquerade ball fashion show. There, they had to pick their partners and kiss them at the end of the runway. Notable scenes were Cory, who picked a guy instead of a girl as a partner, Chris H., who chose two female partners, and Bianca with Chlea, both of whom were left without a man to walk with.\n\nAfterwards, the models were interviewed individually. Jourdan revealed that she had married and divorced a man at the age of eighteen. Virgg talked about her being transgender, and that she had begun to take hormones in preparation for sex reassignment surgery. Mike confessed that he had been discovered by Tyra while working on an ice cream truck. Jeremy admitted that he had been chubby as a kid, but managed to overcome his struggles and become fit. Marvin talked about his home life, and about his father's profession as a janitor. Chris H. spoke about his experience of having been homeless. Later, all thirty-five semifinalists were driven to the top model house. There, the pool of contestants was narrowed down to twenty-six people who would spend the night there before the permanent and official cast was revealed.\n\nThe chosen twenty-six finalists moved into the top model home, where they would spend the night. Tyra and Rob dropped by in order to talk to the hopefuls about the different aspects of male and female modeling. Personalities clashed when playful Chris H., punched Phil in his groin area. He was quickly confronted by the other male models. Seeing this, Nina tried to comfort him and got to know him more.\n\nLater that night, the models were photographed so that they could earn the fan votes that would allow them into the final cast. Chris H. and Jourdan struggled during the beginning of the shoot, while others excelled. Back at the model house, Jourdan began to talk to Jeremy and told him that they were only friends. She also stated that she felt uncomfortable and slightly irritated with Jeremy following her around. Nina talked to Chris H. and tried to convince him to open up to more to the people there. Immediately before the final cast was going to be revealed, Virgg requested to speak to Tyra. She explained that the hormones were taking a toll on her, and as a result, she had decided to quit the competition. The top sixteen models were then revealed by Tyra, leaving the eliminated semifinalists to be sent home. Immediately after, Tyra announced that they would have to walk on a vertical runway for [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]], but continued with a cliffhanger.\n\n*'''Special guests:''' [[Paul Marciano]]\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 240\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = The Girl Who Gets Married Again\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|9}}\n| Viewers         = 1.22<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/12/friday-final-tv-ratings-americas-next-top-model-would-you-fall-for-that-2020-adjusted-down/196944/|title=Friday Final TV Ratings: 'America's Next Top Model', 'Would You Fall For That?' & '20/20' Adjusted Down|date=August 12, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The episode began with the conclusion of the last episode, where the chosen top sixteen finalists had a vertical catwalk for Guess as their first challenge with Rob and supermodel [[Jessica Hart (model)|Jessica Hart]] as the judges. Chlea described Kelly's attitude backstage. Marvin, Cory and Renee excelled while Chris H., Bianca and Mike struggled. Bianca completely gave up on the catwalk, opting to go limp down the runway. Rob and Jessica thought Mike's walk was the worst. In contrast, they were impressed by Marvin and Renee. After the challenge, Jessica revealed that Mike and Bianca had been the weakest and that Marvin and Renee had been the standouts. Ultimately, Renee was chosen as the challenge winner for having the highest challenge score. As her reward, she got to use the Tyra Suite, which she chose to share with Kanani. Back at the model house, the models were able to see all the scores from the challenge. Mike and Bianca are the two lowest scores, which made Mike worried. As a result, he proceeded to drink himself to sleep.\n\nThe next day the contestants had their first photo shoot where they had to portray different types of weddings. Jourdan impressed during her session, and managed to deliver a great picture. Marvin, Don and Chris H. receive praise for doing well. Mike on the other hand was chastised for looking stiff, which led to Alexandra outshining him in their shot. Marvin was praised for his shot who outshone the girls in his photo while Bianca who failed to do that was criticised. Chris S. and Phil also struggled at the shoot.\n\nAt panel, Chris H., Don, Jiana and Alexandra received good feedback. Marvin received praise for his strong photograph, and later received first call-out for having the highest combined score. Chlea was reprimanded by Kelly for her behavior at the challenge, while Phil was told that he had one of the lowest social media scores. Mike, Chris S., and Bianca ultimately wound up in the bottom three. Tyra noted that Mike had the worst walk of the bunch, and that she felt that Bianca had faded in the group shot. Despite his high fashion look, she critiqued Chris S. for having produced a weak photograph. Bianca was eliminated first for having the lowest overall score. Chris S. followed suit, leaving Mike to be spared from elimination.\n\n*'''Featured photographer:''' Douglas Friedman\n*'''Special guests:''' Jessica Hart\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 241\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Guy Who Gets a Weave\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|16}}\n| Viewers         = 1.40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/20/friday-final-tv-ratings-americas-next-top-model-adjusted-up-final-football-numbers/198196/|title=Friday Final TV Ratings: 'America's Next Top Model' Adjusted Up + Final Football Numbers|date=August 20, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Marvin got to stay in the Tyra Suite after having received a best photo, which he chose to share with Don. Cory became irritated because he felt that the other guys in the competition were acting like a bunch of hormonal teenagers. The next day, the models were taken to a penthouse. Tyra and Rob came in to teach them a lesson on how to create chemistry in their photos. The models began practicing the three rules of sexual chemistry, fresh breath, tension and inhale. Then, the models are paired up to showcase what they have learnt. A lot of the couples were pretty good at selling this, with the exception of Phil, who felt uncomfortable partnering with Alexandra. The models were told that they were doing a risqu\u00e9 photo shoot, and that they were going to be working in pairs with Rob and [[Victoria's Secret]] model [[Alessandra Ambrosio]].\n\nChris H., Jiana, Jourdan and Renee excelled at the shoot, while Don, Marvin and Chlea struggled to look sexy. After the shoot, the models went back to their house. There they found a Tyra Mail, which told them that they would be receiving their makeovers. At the makeovers, almost everyone was satisfied with their new looks. Kelly went up to Chlea during her makeover and asked her if they could 'make over' their relationship, feeling that they gotten off on the wrong foot. They talked out their issues and hugged it out. The guys also learned that they would undergo hair removal, which some of the girls got a hoot out of watching.\n\nAt judging, both Jiana and Mike received praise for their strong shots. Mike redeemed himself and received the best photo of the week. Chlea, Don, Phil and Marvin received mediocre feedback. Meanwhile Jeremy was critiqued by Tyra, who said he looked like a \"Gorilla\" in his photo. Chlea and Don wound up in the bottom two for producing lackluster photographs. Don was ultimately saved and Chlea was eliminated.\n\n*'''Featured photographer:''' Sarah Silver\n*'''Special guests:''' Alessandra Ambrosio, Chad Kenyon, Yuki Tomoyuki, Harry Karp, Adrian Mekertichian, Christopher\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 242\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = The Girl Who Went Around in Circles\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|23}}\n| Viewers         = 0.85<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/26/friday-final-tv-ratings-perfect-score-and-americas-next-top-model-adjusted-down-final-football-numbers/199262/|title=Friday Final TV Ratings: 'Perfect Score' and 'America's Next Top Model' Adjusted Down + Final Football Numbers|date=August 26, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The episode starts off with everyone hovering over Mike's photo from the prior elimination. Mike told Chris H. to \"shut up\", which set him off. Chris H. and Mike began to argue, with Chris H. demanding an apology from Mike. Cory then talked to Chris H. and asked why he reacted to people the way he did. Cory told him that he needed to talk to everyone in the house and tell them his story. Chris H. called for a house meeting and proceeded to tell everyone that because of his past, he just didn't know how to act around people and how to cope with things. Most of the models could understand where he was coming from, but Mike remained unswayed by Chris H.'s confession.\n\nThe next day the contestants went to a club where they met Johnny and a special guest, the editor of ''[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]'' magazine, Marvin Scott Jarrett. He told the models that they would be doing a fashion show on a rotating platform. Mike received some tips from Johnny about his runway walk, since he had the worst walk in the competition. Backstage Johnny introduced the models to their stylists Ashton Michael and Kimberley Gordon, who were also going to judge their walks. Nina began to worry because she had sprained one of her ankles during casting week. She worried that she would be unable to participate in the challenge. Instead of backing out from the challenge, she tried wrapping her ankle to see if that would help with her walk without the risk of getting hurt. Chris H. comforted Nina and told her that she was very strong. During the show, Jourdan, Renee, Phil and Chris H. excelled. Jeremy and Mike struggled most, both Ashton and Kimberley agreed that they had been the worst. In the end, Jourdan was revealed to be the winner of the challenge. As a reward, she was allowed to keep her wardrobe from the show. She was also given the opportunity to make an appearance on Nylon TV. Back at the house the models were able to see their scores from the challenge. Mike and Jeremy had the lowest scores, which made Jeremy extremely worried.\n\nThe models went to their next photo shoot, where they would be posing in a trailer park with a [[Honey Boo Boo]] impersonator in groups. The models were allowed to choose their partners for the shoot, which left Jeremy, Kanani and Don to work as a trio. During the shoot, Jourdan, Chris H., Cory, Nina and Phil received praise from the photographer. Jeremy struggled, and Mike was chastised for not doing his best. Marvin was also criticized for having the same facial expression in each shot.\n\nAt panel, Jourdan, Phil, Nina, Don and Chris H. received praise from the judges. Jourdan received best photo for having the highest overall score of the week. Mike and Jeremy both received negative feedback, and were consequently placed in the bottom two. Tyra critiqued Mike for delivering yet another weak photograph. She also revealed that the judges were worried that his strong photo the week before had just been luck.

She had been given the task to choose the phone time for everyone in the house, but arranged the phone schedules so that Nina and herself would receive ten minutes on the phone with everyone else getting five. This made everyone in the house very irritated with her, especially Renee, who decided to take her anger a step further by threatening to slap Jourdan in the face.\n\nLater that same day, the models were challenged to become fashion correspondents. The task is overseen by Bryanboy and Perez Hilton. The contestants are asked to pull random people off the street and conduct interviews with them about their personal style. After the challenge, Perez called out Jiana and Marvin as the weakest during the challenge for having failed to ask all the questions he and Bryanboy had requested.

Phil aggravated his team by cutting the sleeves off of the designer's clothes as well as throwing a rock at a fence, breaking it. Due to damaging property, Cory's team was placed last for the challenge. Kelly explained that although Don's team produced stellar photos, they had forgotten to use a female model in one of their pictures. As a result, Kanani's team won the challenge. Chris H. became angered by his low score in the challenge and began taking it out on other contestants. Nina attempted to calm him down but he blew up at her, shocking and hurting her. Later that night some of the boys decided to place clown dolls in the girls' room, fully aware of the fact that Renee and Kanani were scared of clowns.

At the pool, Chris and Marvin had a minor confrontation when Marvin thought Chris' score last week was unbalanced due to Kelly Cutrone constantly giving him higher scores.

The models will have to walk under water, while wearing Seawalker helmets to help them breathe. Don is especially worried by this, due to have past anxiety attacks. Nina reveals she had part of her lungs removed due to inhaling an airborne fungus. At the sea runway, Jourdan, Renee and Chris did extremely well for the most part, while Marvin and Jeremy fell flat in convincing the designer by their walk. Nina broke down which frustrated Chris, after being told she cannot participate in the sea runway for her lung problem. As a result, she and Don who panicked under water and quickly bailed the runway, have to jump in the sea and pose while wearing snorkels, instead of walking with a helmet. Later, Renee won the challenge for having the best performance under water.

As the models talked about certain feelings and emotions like Jourdan brought her struggles in the past with her ex-husband, Chris also expressed his jealousy about the others' strong relationships and that he didn't have a close friend in the house which dismays Nina knowing that she had been Chris's closest friend and that he didn't feel the same.\n\nThe next day, while working out, Jeremy confronted Chris and recalled their past experiences while they were met in Bali. Jeremy pointed out that he was shown by Chris's lack of respect. Everyone in the house started listening to their drama while Nina was sleeping sound. The photoshoot came where they had to model designs by a deaf 11-year old designer, Rafi A. Ridwan and Oka Diputra in a Rice Paddy. The models showed their high-fashion abilities to Tyra for a 10-second pose teach. Jourdan, Cory and Marvin excelled and proved their modelling abilities in the shoot while Chris was criticized for being bad tempered and performing lackluster and Nina for not knowing to connect her body and face. Jeremy was told to not having the ability to work his body. Also, Renee was constantly told of her flat expression and inability to stand out.\n\nAfter the photoshoot, they head to [[Ubud]] into two teams in three, Chris, Cory, Nina and Renee went to a healing and cleansing trip while Jourdan, Jeremy and Marvin toured around [[Ubud Monkey Forest]]. They were housed to the elephant village where tensions rose again while the bed assignment was done. Chris felt he was not assigned properly which prompted Jeremy to be the mature one. Jourdan, Nina and Cory shared the big bed, Marvin and Renee shared the couches, Jeremy slept on the small couch on the room and Chris made his own. The next day, the models rode some elephants where Marvin and Renee; who have the nickname of \"Marnee\", kissed. They then went back to the hotel and were greeted by the skull Mail.

Marvin Scott Jarrett shot the three models in different locations. He stressed his awe for the three models. He applauded Jourdan's striking performance, Marvin's drive and Cory's masculinity. After the shoot, the models had the chance to talk with Jarrett himself about their lives and journey in ''Top Model''. For the last challenge, the final three went to the site where the final runway show would be taking place. Executive Producers Ken Mok and Laura Fuest Silva are at the show where Ken and Laura explained as they would have to perform in a fashion feature, with the theme involving a 'love triangle' with an abusive relationship. Jourdan excelled after performing amazingly and believably. Jourdan and Cory had to kiss with each other, while Marvin felt a bit uneasy.\n\nThe eliminate models must have debated to switch teams, as a result, Mike left Corey's team and switch to Jourdan's team as he felt Jourdan looked like a more model. Twenty minutes before the show has begun, Tyra and the judges revealed a twist that there would be one final elimination before the fashion show. The judges deliberated on the models' Guess photos. Jourdan was praised for having produced a Guess-worthy photograph and having a great social media response for her \"booty tooch\", but they believed her photo not as strong as it could have been. Marvin was lauded for his cheekbones but Kelly said he was depending too much on his looks. Cory was noted to look very masculine but the Judges were not sure if he could be \"the man\". The judges said they had already scored the photos and the results were in, and that only two of them would continue on in the competition. The episode ended with a cliffhanger.\n\n*'''Featured Photographers:'''  Yu Tsai, Dinar Puspita Sari\n*'''Special Guests:''' Mrs. Maria, Laura James, Marvin Scott Jarrett, Ken Mok, Laura Fuest Silva\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 20)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 253\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = Finale Part 2: The Guy or Girl Who Becomes America's Next Top Model\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|15}}\n| Viewers         = 1.29<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/11/18/friday-final-ratings-hawaii-five-0-undercover-boss-grimm-last-man-standing-the-carrie-diaries-the-neighbors-adjusted-down/216297/|title=Friday Final Ratings: 'Hawaii Five-0', 'Undercover Boss', 'Grimm' & 'Raising Hope' Adjusted Up; 'Last Man Standing', 'The Carrie Diaries' & 'The Neighbors' Adjusted Down|date=November 18, 2013|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Concluded from the previous episode, Tyra and the judges have already made the decision, Jourdan and Marvin advanced into the top two and Cory was eliminated. Despite his elimination, Cory will still be given to participate in the final runway. As the final runway was going to start, Tyra opened up the show by speaking to the crowd in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and explaining that they would be shown the fashion film that the final three had shot the previous episode. Immediately after this, the catwalk show began. Jourdan tripped with her stilettos on her gown leaving her on the verge of tears. Both Jourdan and Marvin wowed the judges with their performances.\n\nThe next day, Tyra visited the final two near the villa and told them that they would be having one final photo shoot, focusing on portraying feral and wild jungle creatures. At panel, both Jourdan and Marvin's walks and bodies of work were given praise. After receiving their evaluations, Jourdan was revealed to be the twentieth winner of ''America's Next Top Model'', leaving Marvin as the first male runner-up in the show.\n\n*'''Special Guests:''' Laura James\n| LineColor       = B50000\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==The Comeback Series==\nMuch like the [[America's Next Top Model (season 19)|previous cycle]], The Comeback Series also returned online with [[Bryanboy]] as its host.

Furthermore, while Tyra had announced that the fan vote would have no say in the final scores, they had been added into the final tally nevertheless. In an article released by Reality TV World, it was revealed that there had been a glitch with the final scores during post-production, and that the actual scores for the finale were 27.0 for Jourdan (having received a nine from all three judges) and 25.0 for Marvin (having received 8 points from Tyra and Kelly, and 9 points from Rob). The CW acknowledged the finale contained incorrect scoring graphics after being contacted about the discrepancy. During an exclusive statement, a representative of the network was quoted as saying: ''\"There was a technical error with the on-air graphics that occurred during post-production of the finale of ANTM, however, as you can see in the photo,<ref name=photo>http://cdn.realitytvworld.com/images/heads/storyleads/topmodel20_finale5.jpg</ref> it didn't change the outcome meaning Jourdan is still the
