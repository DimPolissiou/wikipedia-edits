Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]], a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals, as well as the homeless and the indigent. Access to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by [[Rikers Island]] inmates. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several versions of the origin of the island's name. In one, British [[Cartographers#18th century|cartographers]] named it \"Heart Island\" in 1775 due to its organ-like shape but the 'e' was dropped shortly after.<ref name=\"fascinates\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/27/nyregion/an-island-of-the-dead-fascinates-the-living.html|title=An Island Of the Dead Fascinates The Living|last=Santora|first=Marc|date=January 27, 2003|work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111023538/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/27/nyregion/an-island-of-the-dead-fascinates-the-living.html|archive-date=November 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}} A map drawn in 1777 and subsequent maps refer to the island as \"Hart Island\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}} Other names given to the island during the late 18th century were \"Little Minneford Island\" and \"Spectacle Island\", the latter because the island's shape was thought to resemble [[Glasses|spectacles]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}}\n\nAnother theory, based on the meaning of the English word \"[[Hart (deer)|hart]]\", which means \"stag\", is that the island was named when it was used as a game preserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11613|title=The Islands of Pelham Bay|publisher=[[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]|access-date=November 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309172413/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11613|archive-date=March 9, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref> Another version holds that it was named in reference to deer that migrated from the mainland during periods when ice covered that part of Long Island Sound.<ref name=\"hunt\">{{cite book | last=Hunt | first=Melinda | title=Hart Island | publisher=Scalo | year=1998 | isbn=978-3-931141-90-5 | oclc=40373838 |first2=Joel |last2=Sternfeld }}</ref>{{rp|19}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRjMPZW4heMC|title=The Other Islands of New York City: A History and Guide (Third Edition)|last=Seitz|first=Sharon|last2=Miller|first2=Stuart|year=2011|publisher=The Countryman Press|isbn=978-1-58157-886-7|location=|pages=138\u2013144|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|140}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Hart Island, Bronx, 1966 (cropped).png|thumb|Map from 1966]]\n\nHart Island is approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide at its widest point.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]], a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals, as well as the homeless and the indigent. Access to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by [[Rikers Island]] inmates. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several versions of the origin of the island's name.

Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, ''Born Standing Up'', that he used to take 33 rpm [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.\n\nMartin learned how to play the banjo with help from [[John McEuen]], who later joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song \"King Tut\", being credited as \"The Toot Uncommons\" (as in [[Tutankhamun]]).\n\n[[File:Steve Martin & The Steep Canyon Rangers in Seattle.JPG|left|thumb|Martin playing with the Steep Canyon Rangers in Seattle in November 2009]]\nThe banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.<ref Name=\"Smith\"/> On the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled \"Drop Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour.

Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and later as a frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, [[surreal humor|absurdist]] comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning him [[Emmy]], [[Grammy]], and [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy]] awards, among other honors.\n\nIn 2004, [[Comedy Central]] ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time| title=Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time| date=April 18, 2014| website=Everything2}}</ref> He was awarded an [[Honorary Academy Award]] at the Academy's 5th Annual [[Governors Awards]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Academy Unveils 2013 Governors Awards: Honorees Angelina Jolie, Angela Lansbury, Steve Martin, Piero Tosi| url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/governors-awards-2013-winners-academy-oscars/| magazine=Deadline Hollywood| date=September 5, 2013| accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile he has played [[banjo]] since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various bluegrass acts, including [[Earl Scruggs]], with whom he won a [[Grammy]] for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. He released his first solo music album, ''[[The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo]]'', in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Steve Martin HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|upright|Steve Martin as a senior in high school, 1963]]\nMartin was born on August 14, 1945,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKCfomKSa74C&pg=PA204 |page=204 |last=Whiteley |first=Sandy |title=On This Date |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2002 |isbn=978-0071398275}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGjsvmNt8UgC&pg=PA94 |page=94 |title=Universal Men |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=September 1999 |volume=15 |number=9 |issn=0886-3032}}</ref> in [[Waco, Texas]],<ref>Walker (1999) p1</ref> the son of Mary Lee ([[n\u00e9e]] Stewart; 1913\u20132002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914\u20131997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor.<ref name=\"filmref\">{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieVj9Z-w12UC&pg=PA2&dq=%22steve+martin%22+waco&hl=en&ei=v8SwTLHjFdy4jAeY25yPCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22steve%20martin%22%20waco&f=false| title=Steve Martin: The Magic Years| first=Morris| last=Walker| year=2001| page=2| publisher=SP Books| location=New York| isbn=978-1561719808}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/martin.html |title=Ancestry of Steve Martin |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMartin is of [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Northern Irish|Scots-Irish]], [[Germans|German]] and [[French people|French]] descent, and was raised in [[Inglewood, California]], with sister Melinda Martin, and then later in [[Garden Grove, California]], in a [[Baptist]] family.<ref>Martin (2007) pp.20\u201339</ref> Martin was a cheerleader of [[Garden Grove High School]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/20/top-5-famous-former-male-cheerleaders/ |title=Top 5: Famous former male cheerleaders |date=February 20, 2009 |work=The Washington Times}}</ref> One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During [[World War II]], in the United Kingdom, Martin's father had appeared in a production of ''[[Our Town]]'' with [[Raymond Massey]]. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.<ref Name=\"Mild\"/> He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of [[hatred]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Dominic |title= Steve Martin \u2013 Biography\n|url = http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/steve-martin/biography/118 |publisher=TalkTalk |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nMartin's first job was at [[Disneyland]], selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during his school's summer break.

During his free time, he frequented the [[Main Street, U.S.A.#Shopping|Main Street Magic shop]], where tricks were demonstrated to patrons.<ref Name=\"Mild\"/>  While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the [[home movie]] that was made into the short-subject film ''[[Disneyland Dream]]'', incidentally becoming his first film appearance.  By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in [[Fantasyland]] in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor [[Wally Boag]],<ref name=Boag>Martin (2007) p18\u201319</ref> frequently performing for tips.<ref>Martin (2007) p 39</ref>\n\nIn his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could \"be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition\".<ref>Walker (1999) p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]].\n\n===Comedy===\nAfter high school, Martin attended [[Santa Ana College]], taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and [[Garden Grove High School]] classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at [[Knott's Berry Farm]].<ref Name=\"Mild\"/> Later, he met budding actress [[Stormie Omartian|Stormie Sherk]], and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the [[California State University, Long Beach]], for enrollment with a major in philosophy.<ref Name=\"Mild\"/> Sherk enrolled at [[UCLA]], about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.<ref>Martin (2007) p 65</ref>\n\nInspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor\u2013comedian. His time at college changed his life. {{cquote|It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy.

It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of \"happy feet\", [[banjo]] playing with balloon depictions of concepts like [[venereal disease]], and the \"controversial\" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the \"kittens\" were stuffed animals).

His first substantial film appearance was in a [[short film|short]] titled ''[[The Absent-Minded Waiter]]'' (1977).

That year, [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' was shown only to limited audiences heavy with Oscar voters and critics for just long enough to be eligible, and then went into [[wide release]] after the nominations were announced.<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\">{{cite news|last=Hofler|first=Robert|title=Carr's marketing on 'Deer Hunter' rewrote awards game|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/the-first-oscar-consultant-1118015532/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> It ultimately won that year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar.

Many films that appear to be made with the overt intent of [[gaming the system]] by [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the perceived biases of Academy voters have instead received no nominations at all. Audiences have in turn avoided those films in favor of those that did receive nominations. In a 2014 study of 3,000 films released since 1985, two [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] professors identified the 1990 film ''[[Come See the Paradise]]'' as the most deliberately targeted for the Oscars.

But also in 1948, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s decision in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', forbidding the studios from owning theater chains, changed the film industry profoundly. With their pictures no longer guaranteed to have an adequate theatrical run, and television beginning to offer competition, the studios had to rely increasingly on marketing to make films profitable. Thus their release patterns began following the calendar even more closely than they already had.<ref name=\"NYT mag January article\" />\n\n===''The Deer Hunter''===\nThe first film to deliberately seek Oscar nominations as a [[marketing strategy]] was ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' in 1978. After a disastrous [[test screening]] of the lengthy [[Vietnam War]] epic in Detroit, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] turned to another producer, [[Allan Carr]], with both [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and Hollywood experience, for advice on how to successfully market a depressing film.<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" /> Carr realized that, with such a grim subject and brutal depictions of war and torture, the only way viewers would seek the film out was if it had been nominated for Academy Awards. Carr, once the producers had hired him as a consultant, arranged for two two-week screenings at a single theater in each of New York and Los Angeles before the year ended, the minimum requirements for Oscar eligibility at that time. The audiences were limited to critics and Academy members. After that, Universal pulled the film from distribution<ref name=\"Emanuel Levy article\" /> save for some showings on [[Z Channel]], a boutique cable network that catered to film enthusiasts with showings of rare, arty movies and exclusive [[director's cut]]s of more popular ones. \"We will cultivate the right audience,\" Carr promised. \"''The Deer Hunter'' is an Oscar winner!\"<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" />\n\nWhen the Oscar nominations were announced, ''The Deer Hunter'' received nine. It was immediately put into [[wide release]] with advertising and publicity materials drawing attention to the nominations. Ultimately it won five, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. \"It's a common pattern today,\" said [[Thom Mount]], then president of Universal, years later. \"But it was unheard of in 1978. Now everybody does it.\"<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" /> Critic [[Ty Burr]] agrees. \"The practice is the equivalent of a triumphant [[slam dunk]] in the final seconds, and it often wins the game,\" he wrote in a 2013 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' article.<ref name=\"NYT mag January article\" />\n\n===1980s to present day===\nDuring the 1980s, as Hollywood moved away from director-driven films like ''The Deer Hunter'', focusing on repeating the success of summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] like ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (both of which had also been nominated for Best Picture), [[independent film]]makers refined Carr's methods of exploiting the Oscars. [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]], who produced lavish [[historical drama|costume dramas]], often based on novels by [[Henry James]] or [[E. M. Forster]], began to time their releases to align with the awards season.<ref name=\"Simone Murray book\">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Smone|title=The Adaptation Industry: The Cultural Economy of Contemporary Literary Adaptation|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136660245|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztGoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA169|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref> Their [[A Room with a View (1985 film)|1985 adaptation]] of Forster's ''[[A Room with a View]]'' won three of the eight Oscars it was nominated for.\n\nBy 1991 the modern film-release calendar, in which studios released the movies they had the highest Oscar hopes for in autumn and December, was set. Independent-film mogul [[Harvey Weinstein]] sought prestige for his productions through Oscars; it culminated in a 1998 Best Picture for ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', another costume drama.<ref name=\"NYT mag January article\" /> Similar strategies to ''The Deer Hunter'' brought Weinstein's company another Best Picture in 2010 for ''[[The King's Speech]]'', starring [[Colin Firth]], who got his start in Merchant Ivory's 1980s films.<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" /> Use of the term \"Oscar bait\" in the media began to increase in the mid-1990s to a 2004 peak, after which it has remained stable.<ref name=\"Google ngram\">{{cite web|title=Oscar bait ngram|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Oscar+bait&year_start=1930&year_end=2014&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2COscar%20bait%3B%2Cc0|work=[[Google Books]]|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Statistical analyses==\nA study by Gabriel Rossman and Oliver Schilke, two sociologists at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), reviewed data from the [[IMDb|Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb), such as [[genre]]s and plot keywords, for 3,000 movies released between 1985 and 2009 to see what elements were likeliest to draw Oscar nominations. The researchers found that war movies, historical epics, and biographies earned the most. Plot elements of political intrigue, disabilities, war crimes and show business were also very common element of nominated films. A release during [[Oscar season]], or by an independent division of a major studio were also strong indicators.<ref name=\"ASR study page\">{{cite journal|last=Rossman|first=Gabriel|author2=Schilke, Oliver|title=Close, But No Cigar: The Bimodal Rewards to Prize-Seeking|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|date=February 2014|volume=79|issue=1|pages=86\u2013108|doi=10.1177/0003122413516342}}</ref><ref name=\"UC post about study\">{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Meg|title=Oscar bait or pandering to the audience?|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/oscar-bait-or-pandering-audience|work=[[University of California, Los Angeles]]|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> The study found that some keywords had a strongly negative [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] with Oscar nominations, such as \"[[List of zombie films|zombie]]\", \"[[breast implant]]\" and \"black independent film\".<ref name=\"Slate article about UCLA study\" />\n\nAccording to the study, the movie that scored the highest and thus was the most blatant Oscar bait among the films surveyed was [[Alan Parker]]'s 1990 ''[[Come See the Paradise]]'', released by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"Slate article about UCLA study\" /> It received that score for the previous Oscar nominations of Parker, its setting in Hollywood (star [[Dennis Quaid]] plays a [[projectionist]]) and its depiction of a tragic historical event (his [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] wife and children are [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned]]) against the background of war and [[racism]]. It was only released in a few cities during the last week of that year to make it eligible for the awards. However, it was not nominated for any.<ref name=\"Slate article about UCLA study\" />\n\nSecond and third were ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the 2003 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, and ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'', released in 1996. At the low end, as the movie in that period which least qualified as Oscar bait, was [[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|the 2006 remake]] of ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'', which indeed was not nominated for any Oscars. It was followed by 2009's ''[[Hotel for Dogs (film)|Hotel for Dogs]]'' and ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]'', from 2004.<ref name=\"Slate article about UCLA study\" />\n\nRossman and Schilke used their data to develop an [[algorithm]] that could predict how many Oscar nominations a film would get, based on its similarities to other recent Oscar nominees. It did not take sophisticated statistical analysis, they noted\u2014''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' had for many years correctly predicted the Oscar nominees. Using data on how much the films had cost to make, they treated the system of nominating as a [[All-pay auction|Tullock lottery]] to determine the studios' [[rate of return]] on their investments. They found that while Oscar-nominated films do indeed get at least a small bonus in ticket sales, directly proportional to the number of nominations, films with what they called \"Oscar appeal\" took a loss when they did not get any nominations.<ref name=\"UC post about study\" />\n\n\"We've found that audiences don't like the kinds of aesthetics that are characteristic of Oscar-worthy movies,\" Rossman said. \"The movies tend to be serious and depressing, and audiences don't like that, so making Oscar-y movies is a riskier strategy than the average moviegoer might appreciate.\" As for the payoff a movie gets when it receives nominations, \"[a]udiences don't like the kind of movies that get Oscars, but they do like the Oscars,\" he said. It was the economic bonus from getting nominations or winning that made the losses of not doing so worth it.<ref name=\"UC post about study\" />\n\nA year earlier, Ira Kalb, a professor of marketing at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]], had done research into how big the Oscar payoff could be for a victorious film. \"When used in marketing campaigns, this validation stamp increases the desire of moviegoers to see the films and the talent being honored,\" he wrote in a ''[[Business Insider]]'' article. \"It also keeps the movies in theaters longer boosting box office receipts. And it substantially increases DVD, streaming, download, and cable TV revenues.\"<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" />\n\nHe used the 2010 Best Picture winner, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', as his primary example. Before being nominated, it was expected to make about $30 million in worldwide box office receipts. After it received 12 nominations that year, the most of any film in contention, that estimate was revised upward to $200 million. \"[A]n Academy Award nomination can boost ticket sales by one-third and cause a jump in the DVD sales of movies no longer in theaters,\" wrote Kalb. Winning increases the reward even further. As a result of its win, ''The King's Speech'' was expected to bring in revenues of almost half a billion dollars.<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" /> ({{As of|2014}}, it has grossed $414 million.<ref name=\"King's Speech Box Office Mojo\">{{cite web|title=The King's Speech (2010)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingsspeech.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2014|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>)\n\nSome films, Kalb says, can only be profitable if they are nominated for Oscars. For that reason studios plan their Oscar promotional campaigns long before the movie is even released. It has been estimated that [[The Weinstein Company]] spent $15 million on its Oscar campaign for ''The King's Speech'', almost as much as was spent on the Oscar campaign of Weinstein-produced 1998 Best Picture Winner ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''.<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" />\n[[File:Natalie Portman AA 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Natalie Portman with her Oscar for ''Black Swan''|alt=A young woman with brown hair dangling to her left in a V-neck purple dress holding one of the golden statuettes seen above]]\nActors, too, benefit at least financially from Oscar wins.

They suggest that producers and studios are essentially [[gaming the system]], making movies with less attention to quality than to the features that Academy voters have shown a preference for. \"At its worst, Oscar bait stinks up the room with its pretense to prestige,\" writes ''[[Sactown Magazine]]'' editor S.T. VanAiresdale in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. He cites in particular the 2011 film ''[[Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (film)|Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close]]''. Its producer, [[Scott Rudin]],\n{{quote|... plotted the whole project the way he'd plotted numerous earlier films, from ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' to ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' to ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' and others: Acquire an elite property, attach elite principals, and sell the whole package to a studio as an elite fall-movie-season heavyweight. Sometimes the movie that results is great; sometimes it isn't. It hardly matters. Fold an awards campaign into the film's more conventional marketing, and you might be able to cash in on the buzz\n\nThe strategy worked\u2014sort of. Through the combination of conspicuous campaigning and hard-ass backroom wheedling for which Rudin is renowned, ''Extremely Loud'' got its [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nomination (plus a token [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nod for [[Max von Sydow]]). The producer baited a hook, dropped it in the choppy Sea of Oscar, and came away with the gratification\u2014and the sellable imprimatur\u2014of at least a few Academy nibbles.<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" />}}\nThat particular nomination, which came after the film had not received ''any'' other major film award nomination such as a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], was widely criticized.

For his part, he found the phrase to be \"a kind of anti-intellectual dog whistle\" for some users. Harris further observed that the films by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]], the [[Coen brothers]] and [[David Fincher]] released around Oscar season had many elements in common with movies by directors like [[Tom Hooper]] and [[Stephen Daldry]] often dismissed as Oscar bait, like star-heavy ensemble casts, showcase scenes for the stars and heavy marketing campaigns, yet it was only films by the latter directors that were so labeled. \"[It's] a way of diminishing movies by feminizing them,\" he said. \"[I]t's used as a sneer in the same way that ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theater]]'' was used in the 1980s and '[[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]]' was used in the 1990s.\"<ref name=\"Harris-Buchanan 2016 interview\" />\n\nBuchanan said he used the term only for \"mediocre movies that conform to a preexisting Oscar rubric far better than the more interesting films that get passed over\", citing ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' as an example, which was [[81st Academy Awards#Awards|nominated for Best Picture]] over snubbed, but better acclaimed films of the same year less easy to categorize, such as ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''. Harris responded by noting that ''Frost/Nixon'' had been adapted from a \"pretty un-cinematic\" [[Frost/Nixon (play)|stage play]] and that neither of its stars had ever been nominated for an Academy Award before, whereas ''The Wrestler'' had several aspects often associated with Oscar bait: a sports movie with a character making a last-chance comeback, played by an actor making a comeback who physically transformed himself for the role. \"The difference is the presumptive maleness,\" Harris reiterated. \"[It] permanently exempts a director like Darren Aronofsky from charges of making Oscar bait, but consigns Ron Howard to that category for his whole career.\"<ref name=\"Harris-Buchanan 2016 interview\" />\n\n\"Critics of the phrase Oscar bait might tell you that making movies is already too difficult to do well without adding the pressure of having an awards-worthy product,\" concedes VanAiresdale.<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" /> He nevertheless defended use of the term. \"The takeaway from Weinstein and the rest shouldn't be that Oscar bait is a reductive concept that's bad for movies,\" he wrote. \"Rather, ''bad movies'' are bad for movies.\" Since the race for awards did generate some good movies, he felt, moviegoers should not be so dismissive. \"Oscar bait is the only reason that grown-ups have anything at all to watch in a movie theater anymore, with four months of awards season compensating for the other eight months of craven superhero franchises, anemic romantic comedies, and whatever [[Adam Sandler]] wipes off his shoe.\"<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" />\n\nThe fact that the concept existed and had a name showed how important film still was to American culture, VanAirsdale said.\n{{quote|For all the media hand-wringing about television usurping film's grip on our culture's imagination, no one complains about ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' losing an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] to ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' the way they ''still'' yelp on and on about ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' thwarting ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' for a Best Picture Oscar ...

However, on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where theatrical productions vie for [[Tony Award]]s, while the term \"Tony bait\" has not been seen, many believe those awards have come to determine how plays and musicals are marketed.

While that date, set by the awards committee, varies every year, it is usually in late April. Nearly half of a new season's productions open in March or April. \"Many theater producers and their star actors prefer to open in spring in hopes of having the highest profile possible for Tony voters,\" the ''Times'' wrote. \"[They] open at the last possible moment so their shows (and, hopefully, the rave reviews) are fresh in the minds of Tony nominators and voters.\"<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\" />\n\nTony nominations are announced a few days after the deadline for eligibility, with the awards themselves given out in a nationally televised ceremony in June. \"The weeks after that Tony ceremony are often a bloodbath on Broadway, when several productions typically fold in the absence of an awards-generated boost at the box office. \"If the Tonys don't happen for us,\" said Stephen Byrd, another producer, \"it will hurt the word-of-mouth buzz about the show, and you have a hard time keeping a new show running without that sort of buzz.\" While the influx of tourists into the city during the ensuing summer months might seem to ease such concerns since it means larger audiences, those tourists are more likely to see an established long runner with which they are familiar, usually from a previous visit, than a new show that did not capture the Tony for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] or [[Tony Award for Best Play|Best Play]]. \"Look, tourists don't come and say, 'I've never heard of that show, but I'll go see it,'\" says Nancy Nagel Gibbs, a producer of ''[[Peter and the Starcatcher (play)|Peter and the Starcatcher]]'', a 2012 Tony nominee for the latter award.<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\" />\n\nMany of the Tony winners in recent years have indeed been those productions that opened closer to the deadline. Across the Atlantic, on [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]], the awards-driven clustering of openings is less of a problem because the two major awards for those productions, the [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Awards]] and the [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Awards]], are given out six months apart. [[The Broadway League]], one of the two organizations that sponsors the Tonys, has considered moving the eligibility date back to the end of the calendar year to encourage more openings in the summer.

But also in 1948, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s decision in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', forbidding the studios from owning theater chains, changed the film industry profoundly. With their pictures no longer guaranteed to have an adequate theatrical run, and television beginning to offer competition, the studios had to rely increasingly on marketing to make films profitable. Thus their release patterns began following the calendar even more closely than they already had.<ref name=\"NYT mag January article\" />\n\n===''The Deer Hunter''===\nThe first film to deliberately seek Oscar nominations as a [[marketing strategy]] was ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' in 1978. After a disastrous [[test screening]] of the lengthy [[Vietnam War]] epic in Detroit, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] turned to another producer, [[Allan Carr]], with both [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and Hollywood experience, for advice on how to successfully market a depressing film.<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" /> Carr realized that, with such a grim subject and brutal depictions of war and torture, the only way viewers would seek the film out was if it had been nominated for Academy Awards. Carr, once the producers had hired him as a consultant, arranged for two two-week screenings at a single theater in each of New York and Los Angeles before the year ended, the minimum requirements for Oscar eligibility at that time. The audiences were limited to critics and Academy members. After that, Universal pulled the film from distribution<ref name=\"Emanuel Levy article\" /> save for some showings on [[Z Channel]], a boutique cable network that catered to film enthusiasts with showings of rare, arty movies and exclusive [[director's cut]]s of more popular ones. \"We will cultivate the right audience,\" Carr promised. \"''The Deer Hunter'' is an Oscar winner!\"<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" />\n\nWhen the Oscar nominations were announced, ''The Deer Hunter'' received nine. It was immediately put into [[wide release]] with advertising and publicity materials drawing attention to the nominations. Ultimately it won five, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. \"It's a common pattern today,\" said [[Thom Mount]], then president of Universal, years later. \"But it was unheard of in 1978. Now everybody does it.\"<ref name=\"Variety Allan Carr story\" /> Critic [[Ty Burr]] agrees. \"The practice is the equivalent of a triumphant [[slam dunk]] in the final seconds, and it often wins the game,\" he wrote in a 2013 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' article.<ref name=\"NYT mag January article\" />\n\n===1980s to present day===\nDuring the 1980s, as Hollywood moved away from director-driven films like ''The Deer Hunter'', focusing on repeating the success of summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] like ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (both of which had also been nominated for Best Picture), [[independent film]]makers refined Carr's methods of exploiting the Oscars.

The researchers found that war movies, historical epics, and biographies earned the most.

At the low end, as the movie in that period which least qualified as Oscar bait, was [[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|the 2006 remake]] of ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'', which indeed was not nominated for any Oscars. It was followed by 2009's ''[[Hotel for Dogs (film)|Hotel for Dogs]]'' and ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]'', from 2004.<ref name=\"Slate article about UCLA study\" />\n\nRossman and Schilke used their data to develop an [[algorithm]] that could predict how many Oscar nominations a film would get, based on its similarities to other recent Oscar nominees. It did not take sophisticated statistical analysis, they noted\u2014''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' had for many years correctly predicted the Oscar nominees. Using data on how much the films had cost to make, they treated the system of nominating as a [[All-pay auction|Tullock lottery]] to determine the studios' [[rate of return]] on their investments. They found that while Oscar-nominated films do indeed get at least a small bonus in ticket sales, directly proportional to the number of nominations, films with what they called \"Oscar appeal\" took a loss when they did not get any nominations.<ref name=\"UC post about study\" />\n\n\"We've found that audiences don't like the kinds of aesthetics that are characteristic of Oscar-worthy movies,\" Rossman said. \"The movies tend to be serious and depressing, and audiences don't like that, so making Oscar-y movies is a riskier strategy than the average moviegoer might appreciate.\" As for the payoff a movie gets when it receives nominations, \"[a]udiences don't like the kind of movies that get Oscars, but they do like the Oscars,\" he said. It was the economic bonus from getting nominations or winning that made the losses of not doing so worth it.<ref name=\"UC post about study\" />\n\nA year earlier, Ira Kalb, a professor of marketing at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]], had done research into how big the Oscar payoff could be for a victorious film. \"When used in marketing campaigns, this validation stamp increases the desire of moviegoers to see the films and the talent being honored,\" he wrote in a ''[[Business Insider]]'' article. \"It also keeps the movies in theaters longer boosting box office receipts. And it substantially increases DVD, streaming, download, and cable TV revenues.\"<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" />\n\nHe used the 2010 Best Picture winner, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', as his primary example. Before being nominated, it was expected to make about $30 million in worldwide box office receipts. After it received 12 nominations that year, the most of any film in contention, that estimate was revised upward to $200 million. \"[A]n Academy Award nomination can boost ticket sales by one-third and cause a jump in the DVD sales of movies no longer in theaters,\" wrote Kalb. Winning increases the reward even further. As a result of its win, ''The King's Speech'' was expected to bring in revenues of almost half a billion dollars.<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" /> ({{As of|2014}}, it has grossed $414 million.<ref name=\"King's Speech Box Office Mojo\">{{cite web|title=The King's Speech (2010)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingsspeech.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2014|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>)\n\nSome films, Kalb says, can only be profitable if they are nominated for Oscars. For that reason studios plan their Oscar promotional campaigns long before the movie is even released. It has been estimated that [[The Weinstein Company]] spent $15 million on its Oscar campaign for ''The King's Speech'', almost as much as was spent on the Oscar campaign of Weinstein-produced 1998 Best Picture Winner ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''.<ref name=\"Business Insider article\" />\n[[File:Natalie Portman AA 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Natalie Portman with her Oscar for ''Black Swan''|alt=A young woman with brown hair dangling to her left in a V-neck purple dress holding one of the golden statuettes seen above]]\nActors, too, benefit at least financially from Oscar wins.

They suggest that producers and studios are essentially [[gaming the system]], making movies with less attention to quality than to the features that Academy voters have shown a preference for. \"At its worst, Oscar bait stinks up the room with its pretense to prestige,\" writes ''[[Sactown Magazine]]'' editor S.T. VanAiresdale in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. He cites in particular the 2011 film ''[[Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (film)|Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close]]''. Its producer, [[Scott Rudin]],\n{{quote|... plotted the whole project the way he'd plotted numerous earlier films, from ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' to ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' to ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' and others: Acquire an elite property, attach elite principals, and sell the whole package to a studio as an elite fall-movie-season heavyweight. Sometimes the movie that results is great; sometimes it isn't. It hardly matters. Fold an awards campaign into the film's more conventional marketing, and you might be able to cash in on the buzz\n\nThe strategy worked\u2014sort of. Through the combination of conspicuous campaigning and hard-ass backroom wheedling for which Rudin is renowned, ''Extremely Loud'' got its [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nomination (plus a token [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nod for [[Max von Sydow]]). The producer baited a hook, dropped it in the choppy Sea of Oscar, and came away with the gratification\u2014and the sellable imprimatur\u2014of at least a few Academy nibbles.<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" />}}\nThat particular nomination, which came after the film had not received ''any'' other major film award nomination such as a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], was widely criticized.

For his part, he found the phrase to be \"a kind of anti-intellectual dog whistle\" for some users. Harris further observed that the films by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]], the [[Coen brothers]] and [[David Fincher]] released around Oscar season had many elements in common with movies by directors like [[Tom Hooper]] and [[Stephen Daldry]] often dismissed as Oscar bait, like star-heavy ensemble casts, showcase scenes for the stars and heavy marketing campaigns, yet it was only films by the latter directors that were so labeled. \"[It's] a way of diminishing movies by feminizing them,\" he said. \"[I]t's used as a sneer in the same way that ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theater]]'' was used in the 1980s and '[[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]]' was used in the 1990s.\"<ref name=\"Harris-Buchanan 2016 interview\" />\n\nBuchanan said he used the term only for \"mediocre movies that conform to a preexisting Oscar rubric far better than the more interesting films that get passed over\", citing ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' as an example, which was [[81st Academy Awards#Awards|nominated for Best Picture]] over snubbed, but better acclaimed films of the same year less easy to categorize, such as ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''. Harris responded by noting that ''Frost/Nixon'' had been adapted from a \"pretty un-cinematic\" [[Frost/Nixon (play)|stage play]] and that neither of its stars had ever been nominated for an Academy Award before, whereas ''The Wrestler'' had several aspects often associated with Oscar bait: a sports movie with a character making a last-chance comeback, played by an actor making a comeback who physically transformed himself for the role. \"The difference is the presumptive maleness,\" Harris reiterated. \"[It] permanently exempts a director like Darren Aronofsky from charges of making Oscar bait, but consigns Ron Howard to that category for his whole career.\"<ref name=\"Harris-Buchanan 2016 interview\" />\n\n\"Critics of the phrase Oscar bait might tell you that making movies is already too difficult to do well without adding the pressure of having an awards-worthy product,\" concedes VanAiresdale.<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" /> He nevertheless defended use of the term. \"The takeaway from Weinstein and the rest shouldn't be that Oscar bait is a reductive concept that's bad for movies,\" he wrote. \"Rather, ''bad movies'' are bad for movies.\" Since the race for awards did generate some good movies, he felt, moviegoers should not be so dismissive. \"Oscar bait is the only reason that grown-ups have anything at all to watch in a movie theater anymore, with four months of awards season compensating for the other eight months of craven superhero franchises, anemic romantic comedies, and whatever [[Adam Sandler]] wipes off his shoe.\"<ref name=\"Slated defense article\" />\n\nThe fact that the concept existed and had a name showed how important film still was to American culture, VanAirsdale said.\n{{quote|For all the media hand-wringing about television usurping film's grip on our culture's imagination, no one complains about ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' losing an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] to ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' the way they ''still'' yelp on and on about ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' thwarting ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' for a Best Picture Oscar ...

Mostly we want to believe that a phrase like ''Oscar bait'' is somehow beneath a film culture so obsessed with anointing the best and greatest and top 10 of everything and handing out Academy Awards in the first place. We can't have it both ways, and anyway, why would we want to? As the oldest surviving tradition connecting Hollywood to its audience, Oscar bait is all the movies have left to insulate them from the dull, encroaching disposability of the culture around us.

It featured clips of Meyers and others involved with his show as actors crying frequently, with scenes featuring racial tension and latent homosexuality along with \"pretentiously artistic shots of a man's hand grazing wheat\". [[Intertitle]]s quoted purported reviews from real publications, such as \"If you like films where a character is forced to overcome a rare disease, then this, my friends, is your film\" and comparing the parody film favorably with ''[[The King's Speech]]''.<ref name=\"Seth Meyers parody\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Seth Meyers]]|date=February 21, 2017|title=Oscar Bait|medium=Internet video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjE9Fl4zKNs|access-date=March 1, 2017|publisher=[[Late Night With Seth Meyers]]}}</ref>\n\n==In other media awards==\n\nThe \"bait\" phrasing has been used in the context of the other major American popular-media awards.

However, on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where theatrical productions vie for [[Tony Award]]s, while the term \"Tony bait\" has not been seen, many believe those awards have come to determine how plays and musicals are marketed. Their complaints are similar to those of film enthusiasts.<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\">{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Patrick|title=How Broadway Games the Tonys|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/sunday-review/how-broadway-games-the-tonys.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 22, 2012|accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n\"The Tony deadline is now the central organizing event that drives Broadway, for better and for worse,\" producer Thomas Viertel told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2012. While that date, set by the awards committee, varies every year, it is usually in late April. Nearly half of a new season's productions open in March or April. \"Many theater producers and their star actors prefer to open in spring in hopes of having the highest profile possible for Tony voters,\" the ''Times'' wrote. \"[They] open at the last possible moment so their shows (and, hopefully, the rave reviews) are fresh in the minds of Tony nominators and voters.\"<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\" />\n\nTony nominations are announced a few days after the deadline for eligibility, with the awards themselves given out in a nationally televised ceremony in June. \"The weeks after that Tony ceremony are often a bloodbath on Broadway, when several productions typically fold in the absence of an awards-generated boost at the box office. \"If the Tonys don't happen for us,\" said Stephen Byrd, another producer, \"it will hurt the word-of-mouth buzz about the show, and you have a hard time keeping a new show running without that sort of buzz.\" While the influx of tourists into the city during the ensuing summer months might seem to ease such concerns since it means larger audiences, those tourists are more likely to see an established long runner with which they are familiar, usually from a previous visit, than a new show that did not capture the Tony for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] or [[Tony Award for Best Play|Best Play]]. \"Look, tourists don't come and say, 'I've never heard of that show, but I'll go see it,'\" says Nancy Nagel Gibbs, a producer of ''[[Peter and the Starcatcher (play)|Peter and the Starcatcher]]'', a 2012 Tony nominee for the latter award.<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\" />\n\nMany of the Tony winners in recent years have indeed been those productions that opened closer to the deadline. Across the Atlantic, on [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]], the awards-driven clustering of openings is less of a problem because the two major awards for those productions, the [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Awards]] and the [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Awards]], are given out six months apart. [[The Broadway League]], one of the two organizations that sponsors the Tonys, has considered moving the eligibility date back to the end of the calendar year to encourage more openings in the summer. But that is considered unlikely because the awards telecast does not typically do well enough in the ratings to be likely to be shown during February, a [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]] month on American television.<ref name=\"NYT Tony Awards article\" />\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] used similar baiting techniques to promote \"[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]],\" an iconic [[Super Bowl commercials|Super Bowl commercial]]. In order to ensure the advertisement qualified for advertising awards issued in early 1984, the company purposely aired the ad December 31, 1983 on [[KMVT]], a station serving a small market in Idaho's [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], an area where advertising executives had second homes, ahead of the ad's national debut.<ref name=mentalfloss-1984>{{cite web|title=The True Story of Apple's \"1984\" Ad's First Broadcast...Before the Super Bowl|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29911/true-story-apples-1984-ads-first-broadcastbefore-super-bowl|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Film|Linguistics}}\n* [[Hallmark holiday]], one perceived as created primarily to spur sales at retail establishments\n* [[Very special episode]], a thematically similar phenomenon in television\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|Oscar bait}}\n*[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait Oscar Bait] at [[TV Tropes]]\n\n{{Academy Awards}}\n\n[[Category:Academy Awards]]\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Pejoratives]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:English phrases]]\n", "name_user": "Kailash29792", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_bait"}

He escaped from the labor camp in [[Xining]] to meet his long-missed wife Feng Wanyu and daughter Dandan . However, the police were already waiting outside the house to arrest him.\n\nDandan, who was then a teenage ballerina, could not play the leading role in ''[[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|Red Detachment of Women]]'' due to her father's outlaw status. Under the temptation of regaining the leading role, Dandan revealed her parents' secret meeting plan to the police. The meeting ended with the capture of Lu but Dandan still didn't get the leading role. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lu came home only to find his broken family, his wife suffering from amnesia and his daughter working as textile worker.

He escaped from the labor camp in [[Xining]] to meet his long-missed wife Feng Wanyu and daughter Dandan . However, the police were already waiting outside the house to arrest him.\n\nDandan, who was then a teenage ballerina, could not play the leading role in ''[[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|Red Detachment of Women]]'' due to her father's outlaw status. Under the temptation of regaining the leading role, Dandan revealed her parents' secret meeting plan to the police. The meeting ended with the capture of Lu but Dandan still didn't get the leading role. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lu came home only to find his broken family, his wife suffering from amnesia and his daughter working as textile worker. Under the shock of a former official's sexual harassment, his wife sometimes recognized him as Officer \"Fang\" instead of being her husband.\n\nTo reawaken his wife's memory, Lu played out as a total stranger just to be near his wife.

The cup may also be interpreted in vertical halves to determine \"yes\" or \"no\" answers as well as the overall outcome of the events represented by symbols. For example, some fortune tellers may \"read\" symbols in the \"left\" half as \"negative\" events or outcomes, while symbols in the \"right\" half are \"read\" as \"positive\". Other readers may adhere to the belief that the cup is capable of revealing insights about the past, but it cannot predict events beyond forty days into the future. The saucer may also be incorporated into the reading.
