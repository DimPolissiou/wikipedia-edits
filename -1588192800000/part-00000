They found that the stockpiles consisted mostly of pre-[[World War II]] small arms ranging from [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] and [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 Garand]] and [[M1 carbine]] rifles, to [[MP40]] and [[Thompson submachine gun]]s (SMG), plus [[Bren]] [[light machine guns]] (LMG) and [[Webley Revolver|Webley]] revolvers.<ref>Taylor, p. 62.</ref> The Garands were used in IRA operations as late as the summer of 1976, when a [[British army]] patrol in [[County Armagh|South Armagh]] was fired on by one of these rifles loaded with armour-piercing ammunition.<ref>Bramley, Vincent (2012). ''Two Sides of Hell''. John Blake, p. 57. {{ISBN|184454821X}}</ref>\n\nTo continue and escalate their armed campaign, the IRA needed to be better equipped, which meant securing modern small arms. In previous campaigns weapons had been secured before hostilities commenced via raids on British Army and even [[Irish Army]] weapons depots.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In the 1969\u20131971 period this was no longer feasible.<ref>Previous raids included the 1940 [[Christmas Raid]], the 1953 [[Felstead Raid]], and the 1955 [[Hazebrouck Raid]].</ref> By 1972, the IRA had large quantities of modern small arms, particularly [[Armalite]] rifles, manufactured and purchased in the United States. The [[AR-18]] rifle in particular was found to be very well suited for [[guerrilla warfare]] as its small size and folding stock meant that it was easy to conceal. Moreover, it was capable of rapid fire and fired a high velocity round which provided great \"[[stopping power]]\".<ref name=\"tp108\">Taylor, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThe IRA's main gun runner in the United States was [[George Harrison (Irish Republican)|George Harrison]], an IRA veteran, resident in [[New York City|New York]] since 1938.

In its latest report, dated April 2006, the IMC points out that it has no reason to disbelieve the IRA or information to suspect that the group has not fully decommissioned. Rather, it indicated that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained by individuals outside the IRA's control. Excerpt from the IMC's 10th report:\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to us as having been retained, would have been withheld under local control despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as reported by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms \"under its control\".  The relevant points are that the amount of un-surrendered material was not significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the IRA leadership to eschew terrorism and to follow the political path.

The decommissioning process has taken place using estimates of IRA weaponry submitted by the British and Irish Governments.<ref>Colonel Gaddafi is known to have given the British Government a detailed inventory of weapons he gave to the IRA in the 1970s and 1980s, this list was handed to British intelligence in 1995. See Bowyer Bell Page 578</ref> General de Chastelain said he had seen rifles, particularly AK-47s, machine guns, ground-to-air missiles, explosives, explosive material, mortars, flame throwers, hand guns, timer units and ballistic caps, and some weaponry that was \"very old\", including a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren machine gun]].\n\nThe IICD's final report was issued on 26 September 2005 and the panel stated to the press:<ref>The IICD PDF report is available [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_09_05_decommissioning.pdf here].</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities of arms which we believe include all the arms in the IRA's possession\u2026 Our new inventory is consistent with these estimates. We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA's arsenal.</blockquote>\n\nand while they could not report on the quantity or types of weapons destroyed they said:\n\n<blockquote>The experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so incontrovertible that at the end of the process [IRA weapon decommissioning] it demonstrated to us \u2013 and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have been with us \u2013 that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now been decommissioned.</blockquote>\n\nIrish [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) [[Bertie Ahern]] also stated at the time:\n\n<blockquote>The weapons of the IRA are gone, and are gone in a manner which has been verified and witnessed.<ref>{{cite web | title = IRA 'has destroyed all its arms' | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4283444.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 26 September 2005 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, despite the conclusion of the IICD agreeing with the figures provided by the British security forces, unnamed sources in [[MI5]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|PSNI]] have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process, a claim which so far remains unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite web | title = House of Commons Hansard Debates for 8 Feb 2006 (pt 26) | author = | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/debtext/60208-26.htm | publisher = House of Commons | date = 8 February 2006 | accessdate = 18 March 2007}}</ref> These reports have since been scotched by the group overseeing the activities of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland \u2013 the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] (IMC). In its latest report, dated April 2006, the IMC points out that it has no reason to disbelieve the IRA or information to suspect that the group has not fully decommissioned. Rather, it indicated that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained by individuals outside the IRA's control. Excerpt from the IMC's 10th report:\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to us as having been retained, would have been withheld under local control despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as reported by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms \"under its control\".  The relevant points are that the amount of un-surrendered material was not significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the IRA leadership to eschew terrorism and to follow the political path. We will continue to monitor the position.<ref>10th Report of the IMC Page 15 April 2006, available [http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/ACFEF3.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174400/http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/ACFEF3.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{PIRA}}\n\n[[Category:Arms trafficking]]\n[[Category:International maritime incidents]]\n[[Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army|Arms importation]]\n", "name_user": "FDW777", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLast arms deals:added link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_arms_importation"}

This is the difference between the internal energy and the [[Helmholtz free energy]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Heat transfer]]\n* [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (temperature)]]\n* [[Thermal energy storage]]\n* [[Thermal science]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{footer energy}}\n\n[[Category: Thermodynamic properties]]\n[[Category: Forms of energy]]\n", "name_user": "73.94.205.213", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy"}

Three more UK singles were released in the wake of her initial success: \"In Your Care\" (UK #16), \"Lords of the New Church\" (UK #26) and \"Arienne\" (UK #30).
