[[Landslide]]s at the margins of the [[volcanic vent]]s expanded the forming craters and supplied additional ice to the evaporation processes,{{sfn|Beg\u00e9t|Hopkins|Charron|1996|p=66}} ultimately yielding the large size of the Espenberg maars.{{sfn|Beg\u00e9t|Hopkins|Charron|1996|p=68}} The eruptions that formed the Espenberg maars occurred during fully [[glacial]] climate, while [[interglacial]] (including Holocene) eruptions on the Seward Peninsula have yielded lava flows; this implies that the glacial climate influenced the types of eruption that took place.<ref name=\"BegetLayer2003\" />\n\nThe Espenberg maars have been used as analogues for certain craters on [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Williams2018\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Wood1992\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27910629|title=Volcanoes of North America : United States and Canada|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last1=Wood|first1=Charles Arthur|last2=Kienle|first2=Juergen|isbn=0-521-43811-X|edition=1|location=[[Cambridge, England]]|oclc=27910629|p=106}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BegetLayer2003\">{{Cite conference|last1=Beget|first1=J.|first2=P.|last2=Layer|first3=M.|last3=Keskinen|year=2003|title=Interactions between volcanism, permafrost, Milankovitch cycles and climate change on the Seward Peninsula|conference=Geol.

The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nBlackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ...

These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form.

The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure.

The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city.

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals.

The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

It is also known as Tra\u00e7ado, the Portuguese word for mixed. Alternatively, is known as a mixture of \"everything you have in the bar\" in some places. <!-- gallo is rooster in Spanish, galo is rooster in Portuguese --> It is questionable whether the proportions in rabo-de-galo have ever been formally established. Most bartenders will simply \"eyeball\" the two ingredients, adjusting the proportions to the customer's taste. A quite common version calls for 2/3 of cacha\u00e7a and 1/3 of vermouth. Rabo-de-galo is usually served straight up in large shot glasses. A popular variation in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil substitutes the vermouth with [[Cynar]], an Italian bitter [[ap\u00e9ritif]] [[liqueur]] flavored with artichoke.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n==Caju Amigo (Friendly Cashew)==\n{{Infobox cocktail \n| iba         = \n| name        = Caju amigo\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| type        = cocktail\n| flaming     = \n| cacha\u00e7a = yes\n| served      = neat\n| garnish     = Slice of cashew\n| drinkware   = shot\n| ingredients = *1 part cacha\u00e7a\n*1 slice of cashew, or 1 part [[cashew]] juice\n| prep        = The slice is placed on the tongue and chased by the shot of cacha\u00e7a.

The sugar is first caramelized with spices (whole cloves, cinnamon sticks and ginger chunks) and citrus peels (orange and lime). This mixture is then boiled with water for 10 minutes.

Rabo-de-galo is usually served straight up in large shot glasses.
