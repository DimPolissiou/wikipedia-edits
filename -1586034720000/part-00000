{"title_page": "Physicalism", "text_new": "{{short description|Theory in philosophy}}\nIn [[philosophy]], '''physicalism''' is the [[metaphysical]] thesis that \"everything is physical\", that there is \"nothing over and above\" the physical,<ref>See Smart, 1959</ref> or that everything [[supervenience|supervenes]] on the physical.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Physicalism is a form of ontological [[monism]]\u2014a \"one [[Substance theory|substance]]\" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a \"two-substance\" ([[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]) or \"many-substance\" ([[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]) view. Both the definition of \"physical\" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.\n\nPhysicalism is closely related to [[materialism]]. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). The [[philosophical zombie]] argument<ref name=\"Chalmers, D. 1996\" /> is an attempt to challenge physicalism.\n\n== Definition of physicalism ==\nThe word \"physicalism\" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/ Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>\n\nThe use of \"physical\" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. [[Karl Popper]] defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation<ref name=\"Popper2002\" />). A \"physical property\", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are  physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of \"metaphysical or logical combination of properties\" using the notion of [[supervenience]]: A property ''A'' is said to supervene on a property ''B'' if any change in ''A'' necessarily implies a change in ''B''.<ref>See Bennett and McLaughlin, 2011</ref> Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are [[type physicalism|type identical]] to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with [[multiple realizability]].<ref>See Putnam, 1967</ref>\n\nFrom the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" />\n\nTwo common approaches to defining \"physicalism\" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that \"a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Likewise, the object-based conception claims that \"a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents\".\n\nPhysicalists have traditionally opted for a \"theory-based\" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics,<ref>See e.g., Smart, 1978; Lewis, 1994.</ref> or a future (ideal) physics.<ref>See e.g., Poland, 1994; Chalmers, 1996; Wilson, 2006.</ref> These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of [[Hempel's dilemma]]<ref>Andrew Melnyk should apparently be credited with having introduced this name for Hempel's argument. See Melnyk, 1997, p.624</ref> (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction<ref>see Vincente, 2011</ref>) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.<ref>See Hempel, 1969, pp.180-183; Hempel, 1980, pp.194-195.</ref>\n\nWhile the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested,<ref>For a recent defence of the first horn see Melnyk, 1997. For a defence of the second, see Wilson, 2006.</ref> alternative \"non-theory-based\" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned \"object-based\" conception of the physical.<ref>See Jackson, 1998, p.7; Lycan, 2003.</ref> An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that [[panpsychism]] or [[panprotopsychism]] is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.\n\nDavid Papineau<ref>See Papineau, 2002</ref> and Barbara Montero<ref>See Montero, 1999</ref> have advanced and subsequently defended<ref>See Papineau and Montero, 2005</ref> a \"via negativa\" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as \"the non-mental\". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish [[neutral monism]] (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.<ref>See e.g., Judisch, 2008</ref>\n\n=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===\n\nAdopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as \"all properties are physical\" can be unraveled to:\n\n1) Physicalism is [[Truth|true]] at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is also a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\">See Jackson, 1998</ref>\n\nApplied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at ''every possible world'' in which the physical properties and laws of the actual  world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or \"fixed\" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes \"automatically\".\n\nUnfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world ''w''. To see this, imagine a world in which there are ''only'' physical properties\u2014if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are ''not'' also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain \"[[epiphenomenal ectoplasm]]\", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them).<ref name=\"Lewis1983\" /><ref name=\"Horgan1982\" /> To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a \"that's-all\" or \"totality\" clause<ref>Jackson, 1998</ref> or be restricted to \"positive\" properties.<ref>Chalmers, 1996</ref> Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:\n\n2) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a ''minimal'' physical duplicate of ''w'' is a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/>\n\nApplied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' (without any further changes), is duplicate of ''w'' without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are ''not'' \"minimal\" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.<ref>Where \"metaphysical necessitation\" here simply means that if \"B\" metaphysically necessitates \"A\" then any world in which B is instantiated is a world in which A is instantiated--a consequence of the metaphysical supervenience of A upon B. See Kripke, 1972.</ref>\n\nBut while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the \"epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem\"<ref>See e.g., Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.</ref>) it faces a different challenge: the so-called \"blockers problem\".<ref>See Hawthorne, 2002.</ref> Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world ''w<sub>1</sub>'') is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener\u2014\"a blocker\"\u2014could, were it to exist at ''w<sub>1</sub>,'' prevent the non-physical properties in ''w<sub>1</sub>'' from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at ''w<sub>1</sub>.'' Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at ''w<sub>1</sub>.'' One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what [[David Chalmers]] (1996) calls \"positive properties\". A positive property is one that \"...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part.\"<ref>Chalmers, 1996, p.40.</ref> Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:\n\n3) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is a positive duplicate of ''w''.<ref>Chalmers, 1996; Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.</ref>\n\nOn the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' will be absent, hence ''w<sub>1</sub>'' will not be counted as a world at which physicalism is true.<ref>see Hawthorne, 2002, p.107</ref> [[Daniel Stoljar]] (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count ''w<sub>1</sub>'' as a world at which physicalism is true after all.<ref>See Stoljar, 2010, p.138</ref>\n\nA further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called \"necessary beings problem\".<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/> A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as [[God]]). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] condition for the truth of physicalism.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/>\n\nAdditional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties.<ref name=\"Kim1993\" /> Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).<ref name=\"DStoljar\" />\n\n=== Realisation physicalism ===\n\nClosely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.<ref name=\"Melnyk1997\" />\n\n=== Token physicalism ===\n{{See also|Anomalous monism}}\n\nToken physicalism is the proposition that \"for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y\". It is intended to capture the idea of \"physical mechanisms\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Token physicalism is compatible with [[property dualism]], in which all substances are \"physical\", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a \"nation\", or \"soul\") that are not equal to any physical object.\n\n== Reductionism and emergentism ==\n\n=== Reductionism ===\n\nThere are multiple versions of reductionism.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a \"linguistic\" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory.<ref name=\"Smart1959\" /> Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.<ref name=\"Nagel1961\" />\n\nThe combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is [[type physicalism]] or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that \"for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.\n\nA common argument against type physicalism is [[multiple realizability]], the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence).<ref name=\"Kim1993\" /><ref name=\"Fodor1974\" /> For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms.<ref name=\"Fodor1974\" /> Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument, and it is not clear that token physicalism is susceptible to objections from multiple realizability.<ref>Bickle, J. (2006). Multiple realizability. In Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/. Last revised in 2006, and last checked on May 27, 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Emergentism ===\n{{main|Emergentism}}\n\nThere are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism.\n\nWe can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism),<ref name=\"Byrne1993\" /> others appear to merge both [[dualism (philosophy)|dualism]] and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.\n\n== ''A priori'' versus ''a posteriori'' physicalism ==\nPhysicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced [[A priori knowledge|a posteriori]] (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called \"a priori physicalists\" hold that from knowledge of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive [[indexical]] truths such as \"I am A\" and \"now is B\", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori.<ref name=\"See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001\">See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001</ref> Let \"P\" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, \"T\" for a that's-all truth, \"I\" for the indexical \"centering\" truths, and \"N\" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the [[material conditional]] \"\u2192\", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI \u2192 N is knowable a priori.<ref name=\"See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001\"/> An important wrinkle here is that the [[concept]]s in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI \u2192 N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the [[consequent]], plus the empirical information in the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.\n\nAn \"a posteriori physicalist\", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI \u2192 N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that \"PTI and not N\" is metaphysically impossible.\n\nOne commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the \"conceivability argument\", or [[zombie argument]].<ref>See Chalmers, 2009.</ref> At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:\n\n'''P1''') PTI and not Q (where \"Q\" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some \"generic\" truth about someone being \"phenomenally\" conscious [i.e., there is \"something it is like\"<ref>See Nagel, 1974</ref> to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).\n\n'''P2''') If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.\n\n'''P3''') If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.\n\n'''C''') Physicalism is false.<ref>See Chalmers, 2009</ref>\n\nHere proposition '''P3''' is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some [[possible world]] where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.\n\nSince a priori physicalists hold that PTI \u2192 N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or [[contradictory]].<ref>For a survey of the different arguments for this conclusion (as well as responses to each), see Chalmers, 2009.</ref>\n\nA posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from \"conceivability to metaphysical possibility\". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other [[empirical]] concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable\u2014even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called \"the [[phenomenal concept strategy]]\".<ref>See Stoljar, 2005</ref> Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the ''concept'' of consciousness\u2014not the ''property''\u2014that is in some way \"special\" or [[sui generis]].<ref>cf. Stoljar, 2005</ref> Other a posteriori physicalists<ref>e.g., Tye, 2009</ref> eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as \"water covers 60% of the earth's surface\" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts \"water\" and \"earth\" ''et cetera''. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.<ref>For critical discussion, see Chalmers, 2009.</ref>\n\n== Other views ==\n\n=== Strawsonian physicalism ===\n[[Galen Strawson]]'s ''realistic physicalism'' (or \"realistic monism\") entails [[panpsychism]] \u2013 or at least [[micropsychism]].<ref name=\"Strawson2006\">{{cite book\n |author      = Strawson, Galen\n |authorlink  = Galen Strawson\n |title       = Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?\n |publisher   = Imprint Academic\n |year        = 2006\n |pages       = 4, 7\n |isbn        = 978-1845400590\n |url         = http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/strawson_on_panpsychism.doc\n |quote       = I don't define the physical as concrete reality, as concrete-reality-whatever-it-is; obviously I can't rule out the possibility that there could be other non-physical (and indeed non-spatiotemporal) forms of concrete reality.

Micropsychism is not yet panpsychism, for as things stand realistic physicalists can conjecture that only some types of ultimates are intrinsically experiential.  But they must allow that panpsychism may be true, and the big step has already been taken with micropsychism, the admission that at least some ultimates must be experiential. 'And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us' I think that the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are experiential would look like the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are spatio-temporal (on the assumption that spacetime is indeed a fundamental feature of reality). I would bet a lot against there being such radical heterogeneity at the very bottom of things. In fact (to disagree with my earlier self) it is hard to see why this view would not count as a form of dualism... So now I can say that physicalism, i.e. real physicalism, entails panexperientialism or panpsychism. All physical stuff is energy, in one form or another, and all energy, I trow, is an experience-involving phenomenon. This sounded crazy to me for a long time, but I am quite used to it, now that I know that there is no alternative short of 'substance dualism'... Real physicalism, realistic physicalism, entails panpsychism, and whatever problems are raised by this fact are problems a real physicalist must face.<ref name=\"Strawson2006\"/>|[[Galen Strawson]]|Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Metaphysical naturalism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"DStoljar\">{{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |title=Physicalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

Both the definition of \"physical\" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.\n\nPhysicalism is closely related to [[materialism]]. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). The [[philosophical zombie]] argument<ref name=\"Chalmers, D. 1996\" /> is an attempt to challenge Physicalism.\n\n== Definition of physicalism ==\nThe word \"physicalism\" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/ Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>\n\nThe use of \"physical\" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. [[Karl Popper]] defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation<ref name=\"Popper2002\" />). A \"physical property\", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are  physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of \"metaphysical or logical combination of properties\" using the notion of [[supervenience]]: A property ''A'' is said to supervene on a property ''B'' if any change in ''A'' necessarily implies a change in ''B''.<ref>See Bennett and McLaughlin, 2011</ref> Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are [[type physicalism|type identical]] to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with [[multiple realizability]].<ref>See Putnam, 1967</ref>\n\nFrom the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" />\n\nTwo common approaches to defining \"physicalism\" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that \"a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Likewise, the object-based conception claims that \"a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents\".\n\nPhysicalists have traditionally opted for a \"theory-based\" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics,<ref>See e.g., Smart, 1978; Lewis, 1994.</ref> or a future (ideal) physics.<ref>See e.g., Poland, 1994; Chalmers, 1996; Wilson, 2006.</ref> These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of [[Hempel's dilemma]]<ref>Andrew Melnyk should apparently be credited with having introduced this name for Hempel's argument. See Melnyk, 1997, p.624</ref> (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction<ref>see Vincente, 2011</ref>) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.<ref>See Hempel, 1969, pp.180-183; Hempel, 1980, pp.194-195.</ref>\n\nWhile the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested,<ref>For a recent defence of the first horn see Melnyk, 1997. For a defence of the second, see Wilson, 2006.</ref> alternative \"non-theory-based\" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned \"object-based\" conception of the physical.<ref>See Jackson, 1998, p.7; Lycan, 2003.</ref> An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that [[panpsychism]] or [[panprotopsychism]] is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.\n\nDavid Papineau<ref>See Papineau, 2002</ref> and Barbara Montero<ref>See Montero, 1999</ref> have advanced and subsequently defended<ref>See Papineau and Montero, 2005</ref> a \"via negativa\" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as \"the non-mental\". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish [[neutral monism]] (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.<ref>See e.g., Judisch, 2008</ref>\n\n=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===\n\nAdopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as \"all properties are physical\" can be unravelled to:\n\n1) Physicalism is [[Truth|true]] at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is also a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\">See Jackson, 1998</ref>\n\nApplied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at ''every possible world'' in which the physical properties and laws of the actual  world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or \"fixed\" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes \"automatically\".\n\nUnfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world ''w''. To see this, imagine a world in which there are ''only'' physical properties\u2014if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are ''not'' also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain \"[[epiphenomenal ectoplasm]]\", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them).<ref name=\"Lewis1983\" /><ref name=\"Horgan1982\" /> To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a \"that's-all\" or \"totality\" clause<ref>Jackson, 1998</ref> or be restricted to \"positive\" properties.<ref>Chalmers, 1996</ref> Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:\n\n2) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a ''minimal'' physical duplicate of ''w'' is a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/>\n\nApplied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' (without any further changes), is duplicate of ''w'' without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are ''not'' \"minimal\" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.<ref>Where \"metaphysical necessitation\" here simply means that if \"B\" metaphysically necessitates \"A\" then any world in which B is instantiated is a world in which A is instantiated--a consequence of the metaphysical supervenience of A upon B. See Kripke, 1972.</ref>\n\nBut while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the \"epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem\"<ref>See e.g., Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.</ref>) it faces a different challenge: the so-called \"blockers problem\".<ref>See Hawthorne, 2002.</ref> Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world ''w<sub>1</sub>'') is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener\u2014\"a blocker\"\u2014could, were it to exist at ''w<sub>1</sub>,'' prevent the non-physical properties in ''w<sub>1</sub>'' from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at ''w<sub>1</sub>.'' Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at ''w<sub>1</sub>.'' One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what [[David Chalmers]] (1996) calls \"positive properties\". A positive property is one that \"...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part.\"<ref>Chalmers, 1996, p.40.</ref> Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:\n\n3) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is a positive duplicate of ''w''.<ref>Chalmers, 1996; Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.</ref>\n\nOn the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' will be absent, hence ''w<sub>1</sub>'' will not be counted as a world at which physicalim is true.<ref>see Hawthorne, 2002, p.107</ref> [[Daniel Stoljar]] (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of ''w<sub>1</sub>'' aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count ''w<sub>1</sub>'' as a world at which physicalism is true after all.<ref>See Stoljar, 2010, p.138</ref>\n\nA further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called \"necessary beings problem\".<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/> A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as [[God]]). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] condition for the truth of physicalism.<ref name=\"See Jackson, 1998\"/>\n\nAdditional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties.<ref name=\"Kim1993\" /> Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).<ref name=\"DStoljar\" />\n\n=== Realisation physicalism ===\n\nClosely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.<ref name=\"Melnyk1997\" />\n\n=== Token physicalism ===\n{{See also|Anomalous monism}}\n\nToken physicalism is the proposition that \"for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y\". It is intended to capture the idea of \"physical mechanisms\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Token physicalism is compatible with [[property dualism]], in which all substances are \"physical\", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a \"nation\", or \"soul\") that are not equal to any physical object.\n\n== Reductionism and emergentism ==\n\n=== Reductionism ===\n\nThere are multiple versions of reductionism.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a \"linguistic\" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory.<ref name=\"Smart1959\" /> Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.<ref name=\"Nagel1961\" />\n\nThe combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is [[type physicalism]] or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that \"for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G\".<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.\n\nA common argument against type physicalism is [[multiple realizability]], the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence).<ref name=\"Kim1993\" /><ref name=\"Fodor1974\" /> For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms.<ref name=\"Fodor1974\" /> Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument, and it is not clear that token physicalism is susceptible to objections from multiple realizability.<ref>Bickle, J. (2006). Multiple realizability. In Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/. Last revised in 2006, and last checked on May 27, 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Emergentism ===\n{{main|Emergentism}}\n\nThere are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel.<ref name=\"DStoljar\" /> Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism.\n\nWe can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism),<ref name=\"Byrne1993\" /> others appear to merge both [[dualism (philosophy)|dualism]] and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.\n\n== ''A priori'' versus ''a posteriori'' physicalism ==\nPhysicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced [[A priori knowledge|a posteriori]] (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called \"a priori physicalists\" hold that from knowledge of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive [[indexical]] truths such as \"I am A\" and \"now is B\", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori.<ref name=\"See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001\">See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001</ref> Let \"P\" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, \"T\" for a that's-all truth, \"I\" for the indexical \"centering\" truths, and \"N\" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the [[material conditional]] \"\u2192\", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI \u2192 N is knowable a priori.<ref name=\"See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001\"/> An important wrinkle here is that the [[concept]]s in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI \u2192 N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the [[consequent]], plus the empirical information in the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.\n\nAn \"a posteriori physicalist\", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI \u2192 N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that \"PTI and not N\" is metaphysically impossible.\n\nOne commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the \"conceivability argument\", or [[zombie argument]].<ref>See Chalmers, 2009.</ref> At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:\n\n'''P1''') PTI and not Q (where \"Q\" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some \"generic\" truth about someone being \"phenomenally\" conscious [i.e., there is \"something it is like\"<ref>See Nagel, 1974</ref> to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).\n\n'''P2''') If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.\n\n'''P3''') If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.\n\n'''C''') Physicalism is false.<ref>See Chalmers, 2009</ref>\n\nHere proposition '''P3''' is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some [[possible world]] where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.\n\nSince a priori physicalists hold that PTI \u2192 N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or [[contradictory]].<ref>For a survey of the different arguments for this conclusion (as well as responses to each), see Chalmers, 2009.</ref>\n\nA posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from \"conceivability to metaphysical possibility\". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other [[empirical]] concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable\u2014even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called \"the [[phenomenal concept strategy]]\".<ref>See Stoljar, 2005</ref> Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the ''concept'' of consciousness\u2014not the ''property''\u2014that is in some way \"special\" or [[sui generis]].<ref>cf. Stoljar, 2005</ref> Other a posteriori physicalists<ref>e.g., Tye, 2009</ref> eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as \"water covers 60% of the earth's surface\" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts \"water\" and \"earth\" ''et cetera''. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.<ref>For critical discussion, see Chalmers, 2009.</ref>\n\n== Other views ==\n\n=== Strawsonian physicalism ===\n[[Galen Strawson]]'s ''realistic physicalism'' (or \"realistic monism\") entails [[panpsychism]] \u2013 or at least [[micropsychism]].<ref name=\"Strawson2006\">{{cite book\n |author      = Strawson, Galen\n |authorlink  = Galen Strawson\n |title       = Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?\n |publisher   = Imprint Academic\n |year        = 2006\n |pages       = 4, 7\n |isbn        = 978-1845400590\n |url         = http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/strawson_on_panpsychism.doc\n |quote       = I don't define the physical as concrete reality, as concrete-reality-whatever-it-is; obviously I can't rule out the possibility that there could be other non-physical (and indeed non-spatiotemporal) forms of concrete reality.

Micropsychism is not yet panpsychism, for as things stand realistic physicalists can conjecture that only some types of ultimates are intrinsically experiential.  But they must allow that panpsychism may be true, and the big step has already been taken with micropsychism, the admission that at least some ultimates must be experiential. 'And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us' I think that the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are experiential would look like the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are spatio-temporal (on the assumption that spacetime is indeed a fundamental feature of reality). I would bet a lot against there being such radical heterogeneity at the very bottom of things. In fact (to disagree with my earlier self) it is hard to see why this view would not count as a form of dualism... So now I can say that physicalism, i.e. real physicalism, entails panexperientialism or panpsychism. All physical stuff is energy, in one form or another, and all energy, I trow, is an experience-involving phenomenon. This sounded crazy to me for a long time, but I am quite used to it, now that I know that there is no alternative short of 'substance dualism'... Real physicalism, realistic physicalism, entails panpsychism, and whatever problems are raised by this fact are problems a real physicalist must face.<ref name=\"Strawson2006\"/>|[[Galen Strawson]]|Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Metaphysical naturalism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"DStoljar\">{{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |title=Physicalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==peepeepoopoo==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]].

The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]] cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and [[Louis XIV]] was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]]. Pieces found here include [[table (furniture)|tables]] and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th-8th-century BCE [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]].

''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.</ref>  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.</ref>  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\"/> Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}\n\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so it had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]] cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and [[Louis XIV]] was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.
