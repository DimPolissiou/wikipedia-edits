These observations have been used to:\n* Generate a set of solar isotopic abundances based on a direct sampling of solar material\n* Determine the coronal elemental and isotopic composition with greatly improved accuracy\n* Establish the pattern of isotopic differences between [[cosmic ray|galactic cosmic ray]] and [[solar system]] matter\n* Measure the elemental and isotopic abundances of [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and interplanetary \"pick\u2013up ions\"\n* Determine the isotopic composition of the \"anomalous cosmic ray component\", which represents a sample of the local interstellar medium\n\n===Origin of the elements and subsequent evolutionary processing===\nIsotopic \"anomalies\" in [[meteorites]] indicate that the [[solar system]] was not homogeneous when formed. Similarly, the Galaxy is neither uniform in space nor constant in time due to continuous stellar [[nucleosynthesis]]. \nACE measurements have been used to:\n* Search for differences between the isotopic composition of solar and meteoritic material\n* Determine the contributions of solar\u2013wind and solar energetic particles to lunar and meteoritic material, and to planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres\n* Determine the dominant nucleosynthetic processes that contribute to [[cosmic ray]] source material\n* Determine whether cosmic rays are a sample of freshly synthesized material (e.g., from [[supernovae]]) or of the contemporary [[interstellar medium]]\n* Search for isotopic patterns in solar and Galactic material as a test of galactic evolution models\n\n===Formation of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind===\n[[Solar energetic particle]], [[solar wind]], and spectroscopic observations show that the elemental composition of the [[solar corona|corona]] is differentiated from that of the [[photosphere]], although the processes by which this occurs, and by which the [[solar wind]] is subsequently accelerated, are poorly understood. The detailed composition and charge\u2013state data provided by ACE are used to:\n* Isolate the dominant coronal formation processes by comparing a broad range of coronal and photospheric abundances\n* Study plasma conditions at the source of [[solar wind]] and [[solar energetic particles]] by measuring and comparing the charge states of these two populations\n* Study [[solar wind]] acceleration processes and any charge or mass-dependent fractionation in various types of [[solar wind]] flows\n\n===Particle acceleration and transport in nature===\nParticle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] astrophysics. The unique data set obtained by ACE measurements have been used to:\n* Make direct measurements of charge and/or mass-dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events\n* Constrain [[solar flare]], coronal shock, and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge, mass, and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy\n* Test theoretical models for <sup>3</sup>He\u2013rich [[solar flare|flares]] and solar \u03b3\u2013ray events\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\n===Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS)===\nThe Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer covers the highest decade of the Advanced Composition Explorer's energy interval, from 50 to 500 MeV/nucleon, with an isotopic resolution for elements from Z \u2248 2 to 30. The nuclei detected in this energy interval are predominantly [[cosmic rays]] originating in our Galaxy. This sample of galactic matter investigates the [[nucleosynthesis]] of the parent material, as well as fractionation, acceleration, and transport processes that these particles undergo in the Galaxy and in the interplanetary medium. Charge and mass identification with CRIS is based on multiple measurements of dE/dx and total energy in stacks of silicon detectors, and trajectory measurements in a scintillating optical fiber trajectory (SOFT) hodoscope.

During large solar events, SIS measures the isotopic abundances of [[solar energetic particles]] to determine directly the composition of the [[solar corona]] and to study particle acceleration processes. During solar quiet times, SIS measures the isotopes of low-energy cosmic rays from the Galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous [[cosmic ray]] component, which originates in the nearby interstellar medium. SIS has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge, mass, and kinetic energy of incident nuclei. Within each telescope, particle trajectories are measured with a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements. SIS was specially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme, high flux conditions encountered in large solar particle events. It provides a geometry factor of 40&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> sr, significantly greater than earlier solar particle isotope spectrometers.<ref name=stone98c>{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=E.C.|title=The Solar Isotope Spectrometer for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=357\u2013408|doi=10.1023/A:1005027929871|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..357S|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS)===\n\nThe Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on the ACE spacecraft is an ultra-high-resolution [[mass spectrometer]] that measures particle composition and energy spectra of elements He\u2013Ni with energies from ~45 keV/nucleon to a few MeV/nucleon. ULEIS investigates particles accelerated in [[solar energetic particle]] events, interplanetary shocks, and at the [[solar wind]] termination shock. By determining energy spectra, mass composition, and temporal variations in conjunction with other ACE instruments, ULEIS greatly improves our knowledge of solar abundances, as well as other reservoirs such as the local [[interstellar medium]]. ULEIS combines the high sensitivity required to measure low particle fluxes, along with the capability to operate in the largest solar particle or interplanetary shock events. In addition to detailed information for individual ions, ULEIS features a wide range of count rates for different ions and energies that allows accurate determination of particle fluxes and anisotropies over short (few minutes) time scales.<ref name=mason98>{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=G.M.|title=The Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=409\u2013448|doi=10.1023/A:1005079930780|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..409M|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA)===\nThe Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) was the instrument on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) that determined the ionic charge states of solar and interplanetary energetic particles in the energy range from \u22480.2 MeV nucl-1 to \u22485 MeV charge-1. The charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures, acceleration, fractionation, and transport processes for these particle populations. SEPICA had the ability to resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ULEZEQ on ISEE-1 and -3, on which SEPICA was based. To achieve these two requirements at the same time, SEPICA was composed of one high-charge resolution sensor section and two low- charge resolution, but large geometric factor sections.<ref name=moebius98>{{cite journal|last=Moebius|first=E.|title=The Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) and the Data Processing Unit (S3DPU) for SWICS, SWIMS and SEPICA|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=449\u2013495|doi=10.1023/A:1005084014850|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..449M|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008, this instrument is no longer functioning due to failed gas valves.<ref name = \"ACE Home Page\"/>\n\n===Solar Wind Ions Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) and Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS)===\nThe Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) and the Solar Wind Ions Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) on ACE are instruments optimized for measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of solar and interstellar matter. SWICS determined uniquely the chemical and ionic-charge composition of the [[solar wind]], the thermal and mean speeds of all major solar wind ions from H through Fe at all solar wind speeds above 300&nbsp;km s<sup>\u22121</sup> (protons) and 170&nbsp;km s<sup>\u22121</sup> (Fe+16), and resolved H and He isotopes of both solar and interstellar sources. SWICS also measured the distribution functions of both the interstellar cloud and dust cloud [[pickup ion]]s up to energies of 100 keV e<sup>\u22121</sup>. SWIMS measures the chemical, isotopic and charge state composition of the [[solar wind]] for every element between He and Ni.

To mitigate the effects of this background, the model for identifying ions in the data was adjusted to take advantage of only the ion energy-per-charge as measured by the electrostatic analyzer, and the ion energy as measured by solid-state detectors. This has allowed SWICS to continue to deliver a subset of the data products that were provided to the public prior to the hardware anomaly, including ion charge state ratios of oxygen and carbon, and measurements of solar wind iron. The measurements of proton density, speed, and thermal speed by SWICS were not affected by this anomaly and continue to the present day.<ref name = \"ACE Home Page\"/>\n\n===Electron, Proton, and Alpha-particle Monitor (EPAM)===\nThe Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) instrument on the ACE spacecraft is designed to measure a broad range of energetic particles over nearly the full unit-sphere at high time resolution. Such measurements of ions and electrons in the range of a few tens of keV to several MeV are essential to understand the dynamics of [[solar flares]], co-rotating interaction regions (CIR's), interplanetary shock acceleration, and upstream terrestrial events. The large dynamic range of EPAM extends from about 50 keV to 5 MeV for ions, and 40 keV to about 350 keV for electrons. To complement its electron and ion measurements, EPAM is also equipped with a Composition Aperture (CA) which unambiguously identifies ion species reported as species group rates and/or individual pulse-height events. The instrument achieves its large spatial coverage through five telescopes oriented at various angles to the spacecraft spin axis. The low-energy particle measurements, obtained as time resolutions between 1.5 and 24 s, and the ability of the instrument to observe particle anisotropies in three dimensions make EPAM an excellent resource to provide the interplanetary context for studies using other instruments on the ACE spacecraft.\n<ref name=gold98>{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=R.E.|title=Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor on the Advanced Composition Explorer Spacecraft|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=541\u2013562|doi=10.1023/A:1005088115759|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..541G|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM)===\nThe Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) experiment provides the bulk [[solar wind]] observations for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). These observations provide the context for elemental and isotopic composition measurements made on ACE as well as allowing the direct examination of numerous [[solar wind]] phenomena such as [[coronal mass ejection]], interplanetary shocks, and [[solar wind]] fine structure, with advanced, 3-D plasma instrumentation. They also provide an ideal data set for both heliospheric and [[magnetospheric]] multi-spacecraft studies where they can be used in conjunction with other, simultaneous observations from spacecraft such as [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]. The SWEPAM observations are made simultaneously with independent electron (SWEPAM-e) and ion (SWEPAM-i) instruments. In order to save costs for the ACE project, SWEPAM-e and SWEPAM-i are the recycled flight spares from the joint [[NASA]]/[[ESA]] [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] mission. Both instruments had selective refurbishment, modification, and modernization required to meet the ACE mission and spacecraft requirements.

Warnings and alerts issued by [[NOAA]] allow those with systems sensitive to such activity to take preventative action. The RTSW system gathers solar wind and energetic particle data at high time resolution from four ACE instruments (MAG, SWEPAM, EPAM, and SIS), packs the data into a low-rate bit stream, and broadcasts the data continuously. NASA sends real-time data to NOAA each day when downloading science data. With a combination of dedicated ground stations (CRL in Japan and RAL in Great Britain), and time on existing ground tracking networks (NASA's DSN and the USAF's AFSCN), the RTSW system can receive data 24 hours per day throughout the year. The raw data are immediately sent from the ground station to the [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] in Boulder, Colorado, processed, and then delivered to its Space Weather Operations Center where they are used in daily operations; the data are also delivered to the CRL Regional Warning Center at Hiraiso, Japan, to the USAF 55th Space Weather Squadron, and placed on the World Wide Web. The data are downloaded, processed and dispersed within 5 min from the time they leave ACE. The RTSW system also uses the low-energy energetic particles to warn of approaching interplanetary shocks, and to help monitor the flux of high-energy particles that can produce radiation damage in satellite systems.<ref name=zwickl98>{{cite journal|last=Zwickl|first=R.D.|title=The NOAA Real-Time Solar-Wind (RTSW) System using ACE Data|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=633\u2013648|doi=10.1023/A:1005044300738|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..633Z|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==Science results==\n\n=== The spectra of particles observed by ACE ===\n[[File:ACE O Fluence.png|thumbnail|An oxygen fluences observed by ACE.]]\nThe figure shows the particle fluence (total flux over a given period of time) of oxygen at ACE for a time period just after solar minimum, the part of the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is lowest.<ref name=mewaldt01>{{cite journal|last=Mewaldt|first=R.A.|title=Long-term fluences of energetic particles in the heliosphere|journal=AIP Conf.

Like the solar wind distribution of all ions, that of oxygen has a suprathermal tail of higher-energy particles; that is, in the frame of the bulk solar wind, the plasma has an energy distribution that is approximately a thermal distribution but has a notable excess above about 5 keV, as shown in Figure 1. The ACE team has made contributions to understanding the origins of these tails and their role in injecting particles into additional acceleration processes.\n\nAt energies higher than those of the solar wind particles, ACE observes particles from regions known as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). CIRs form because the solar wind is not uniform. Due to solar rotation, high-speed streams collide with preceding slow solar wind, creating shock waves at roughly 2\u20135 astronomical units (AU, the distance between Earth and the Sun) and forming CIRs. Particles accelerated by these shocks are commonly observed at 1 AU below energies of about 10 MeV per nucleon. ACE measurements confirm that CIRs include a significant fraction of singly charged helium formed when interstellar neutral helium is ionized.<ref name=moebius02>{{cite journal|last=M\u00f6bius|first=E.|title=Charge states of energetic (~ 0.5 MeV/n) ions in corotating interaction regions at 1 AU and implications on source populations|journal=Geophys.

IP shocks are particularly important because they can continue to accelerate particles as they pass over ACE and thus allow shock acceleration processes to be studied in situ.\n\nOther high-energy particles observed by ACE are anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) that originate with neutral interstellar atoms that are ionized in the inner heliosphere to make \"pickup\" ions and are later accelerated to energies greater than 10 MeV per nucleon in the outer heliosphere. ACE also observes pickup ions directly; they are easily identified because they are singly charged. Finally, the highest-energy particles observed by ACE are the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), thought to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova explosions in our galaxy.\n\n=== Other findings from ACE ===\nShortly after launch, the SEP sensors on ACE detected solar events that had unexpected characteristics.

These observations have been used to:\n* Generate a set of solar isotopic abundances based on a direct sampling of solar material\n* Determine the coronal elemental and isotopic composition with greatly improved accuracy\n* Establish the pattern of isotopic differences between [[cosmic ray|galactic cosmic ray]] and [[solar system]] matter\n* Measure the elemental and isotopic abundances of [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and interplanetary \"pick\u2013up ions\"\n* Determine the isotopic composition of the \"anomalous cosmic ray component\", which represents a sample of the local interstellar medium\n\n===Origin of the elements and subsequent evolutionary processing===\nIsotopic \"anomalies\" in [[meteorites]] indicate that the [[solar system]] was not homogeneous when formed. Similarly, the Galaxy is neither uniform in space nor constant in time due to continuous stellar [[nucleosynthesis]]. \nACE measurements have been used to:\n* Search for differences between the isotopic composition of solar and meteoritic material\n* Determine the contributions of solar\u2013wind and solar energetic particles to lunar and meteoritic material, and to planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres\n* Determine the dominant nucleosynthetic processes that contribute to [[cosmic ray]] source material\n* Determine whether cosmic rays are a sample of freshly synthesized material (e.g., from [[supernovae]]) or of the contemporary [[interstellar medium]]\n* Search for isotopic patterns in solar and Galactic material as a test of galactic evolution models\n\n===Formation of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind===\n[[Solar energetic particle]], [[solar wind]], and spectroscopic observations show that the elemental composition of the [[corona]] is differentiated from that of the [[photosphere]], although the processes by which this occurs, and by which the [[solar wind]] is subsequently accelerated, are poorly understood. The detailed composition and charge\u2013state data provided by ACE are used to:\n* Isolate the dominant coronal formation processes by comparing a broad range of coronal and photospheric abundances\n* Study plasma conditions at the source of [[solar wind]] and [[solar energetic particles]] by measuring and comparing the charge states of these two populations\n* Study [[solar wind]] acceleration processes and any charge or mass-dependent fractionation in various types of [[solar wind]] flows\n\n===Particle acceleration and transport in nature===\nParticle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] astrophysics. The unique data set obtained by ACE measurements have been used to:\n* Make direct measurements of charge and/or mass-dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events\n* Constrain [[solar flare]], coronal shock, and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge, mass, and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy\n* Test theoretical models for <sup>3</sup>He\u2013rich [[solar flare|flares]] and solar \u03b3\u2013ray events\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\n===Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS)===\nThe Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer covers the highest decade of the Advanced Composition Explorer's energy interval, from 50 to 500 MeV/nucleon, with an isotopic resolution for elements from Z \u2248 2 to 30. The nuclei detected in this energy interval are predominantly [[cosmic rays]] originating in our Galaxy. This sample of galactic matter investigates the [[nucleosynthesis]] of the parent material, as well as fractionation, acceleration, and transport processes that these particles undergo in the Galaxy and in the interplanetary medium. Charge and mass identification with CRIS is based on multiple measurements of dE/dx and total energy in stacks of silicon detectors, and trajectory measurements in a scintillating optical fiber trajectory (SOFT) hodoscope.

During large solar events, SIS measures the isotopic abundances of [[solar energetic particles]] to determine directly the composition of the solar [[corona]] and to study particle acceleration processes. During solar quiet times, SIS measures the isotopes of low-energy cosmic rays from the Galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous [[cosmic ray]] component, which originates in the nearby interstellar medium. SIS has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge, mass, and kinetic energy of incident nuclei. Within each telescope, particle trajectories are measured with a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements. SIS was specially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme, high flux conditions encountered in large solar particle events.

The charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures, acceleration, fractionation, and transport processes for these particle populations. SEPICA had the ability to resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ULEZEQ on ISEE-1 and -3, on which SEPICA was based.

To mitigate the effects of this background, the model for identifying ions in the data was adjusted to take advantage of only the ion energy-per-charge as measured by the electrostatic analyzer, and the ion energy as measured by solid-state detectors. This has allowed SWICS to continue to deliver a subset of the data products that were provided to the public prior to the hardware anomaly, including ion charge state ratios of oxygen and carbon, and measurements of solar wind iron. The measurements of proton density, speed, and thermal speed by SWICS were not affected by this anomaly and continue to the present day.<ref name = \"ACE Home Page\"/>\n\n===Electron, Proton, and Alpha-particle Monitor (EPAM)===\nThe Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) instrument on the ACE spacecraft is designed to measure a broad range of energetic particles over nearly the full unit-sphere at high time resolution. Such measurements of ions and electrons in the range of a few tens of keV to several MeV are essential to understand the dynamics of [[solar flares]], co-rotating interaction regions (CIR's), interplanetary shock acceleration, and upstream terrestrial events. The large dynamic range of EPAM extends from about 50 keV to 5 MeV for ions, and 40 keV to about 350 keV for electrons. To complement its electron and ion measurements, EPAM is also equipped with a Composition Aperture (CA) which unambiguously identifies ion species reported as species group rates and/or individual pulse-height events. The instrument achieves its large spatial coverage through five telescopes oriented at various angles to the spacecraft spin axis. The low-energy particle measurements, obtained as time resolutions between 1.5 and 24 s, and the ability of the instrument to observe particle anisotropies in three dimensions make EPAM an excellent resource to provide the interplanetary context for studies using other instruments on the ACE spacecraft.\n<ref name=gold98>{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=R.E.|title=Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor on the Advanced Composition Explorer Spacecraft|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=541\u2013562|doi=10.1023/A:1005088115759|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..541G|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM)===\nThe Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) experiment provides the bulk [[solar wind]] observations for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).

The RTSW system gathers solar wind and energetic particle data at high time resolution from four ACE instruments (MAG, SWEPAM, EPAM, and SIS), packs the data into a low-rate bit stream, and broadcasts the data continuously. NASA sends real-time data to NOAA each day when downloading science data. With a combination of dedicated ground stations (CRL in Japan and RAL in Great Britain), and time on existing ground tracking networks (NASA's DSN and the USAF's AFSCN), the RTSW system can receive data 24 hours per day throughout the year. The raw data are immediately sent from the ground station to the [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] in Boulder, Colorado, processed, and then delivered to its Space Weather Operations Center where they are used in daily operations; the data are also delivered to the CRL Regional Warning Center at Hiraiso, Japan, to the USAF 55th Space Weather Squadron, and placed on the World Wide Web. The data are downloaded, processed and dispersed within 5 min from the time they leave ACE. The RTSW system also uses the low-energy energetic particles to warn of approaching interplanetary shocks, and to help monitor the flux of high-energy particles that can produce radiation damage in satellite systems.<ref name=zwickl98>{{cite journal|last=Zwickl|first=R.D.|title=The NOAA Real-Time Solar-Wind (RTSW) System using ACE Data|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=633\u2013648|doi=10.1023/A:1005044300738|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..633Z|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==Science results==\n\n=== The spectra of particles observed by ACE ===\n[[File:ACE O Fluence.png|thumbnail|An oxygen fluences observed by ACE.]]\nThe figure shows the particle fluence (total flux over a given period of time) of oxygen at ACE for a time period just after solar minimum, the part of the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is lowest.<ref name=mewaldt01>{{cite journal|last=Mewaldt|first=R.A.|title=Long-term fluences of energetic particles in the heliosphere|journal=AIP Conf.

Like the solar wind distribution of all ions, that of oxygen has a suprathermal tail of higher-energy particles; that is, in the frame of the bulk solar wind, the plasma has an energy distribution that is approximately a thermal distribution but has a notable excess above about 5 keV, as shown in Figure 1. The ACE team has made contributions to understanding the origins of these tails and their role in injecting particles into additional acceleration processes.\n\nAt energies higher than those of the solar wind particles, ACE observes particles from regions known as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). CIRs form because the solar wind is not uniform. Due to solar rotation, high-speed streams collide with preceding slow solar wind, creating shock waves at roughly 2\u20135 astronomical units (AU, the distance between Earth and the Sun) and forming CIRs. Particles accelerated by these shocks are commonly observed at 1 AU below energies of about 10 MeV per nucleon. ACE measurements confirm that CIRs include a significant fraction of singly charged helium formed when interstellar neutral helium is ionized.<ref name=moebius02>{{cite journal|last=M\u00f6bius|first=E.|title=Charge states of energetic (~ 0.5 MeV/n) ions in corotating interaction regions at 1 AU and implications on source populations|journal=Geophys.

Enriched abundances of helium-3 and helium ions show that the suprathermal tails are the main seed population for these SEPs.<ref name=desai01>{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=M.I. |title=Acceleration of <sup>3</sup>He nuclei at interplanetary shocks|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2001|volume=553|issue=1|pages=L89\u2013L92|doi=10.1086/320503|bibcode=2001ApJ...553L..89D|display-authors=etal}}</ref> IP shocks traveling at speeds up to about 2000 km/s accelerate particles from the suprathermal tail to 100 MeV per nucleon and more. IP shocks are particularly important because they can continue to accelerate particles as they pass over ACE and thus allow shock acceleration processes to be studied in situ.\n\nOther high-energy particles observed by ACE are anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) that originate with neutral interstellar atoms that are ionized in the inner heliosphere to make \"pickup\" ions and are later accelerated to energies greater than 10 MeV per nucleon in the outer heliosphere. ACE also observes pickup ions directly; they are easily identified because they are singly charged. Finally, the highest-energy particles observed by ACE are the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), thought to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova explosions in our galaxy.\n\n=== Other findings from ACE ===\nShortly after launch, the SEP sensors on ACE detected solar events that had unexpected characteristics. Unlike most large, shock-accelerated SEP events, these were highly enriched in iron and helium-3, as are the much smaller, flare-associated impulsive SEP events.<ref name=cohen99>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=C.M.S.|title=Inferred charge states of high energy solar particles from the solar isotope spectrometer on ACE|journal=Geophys.

The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] core on the [[Yukon River]]'s west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the [[Yukon River]] ({{cvt|640|m||}}). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]], one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=[[Whitehorse Star]]|date=14 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Lights (6879315371).jpg|thumb|left|An [[aurora]] over a residential neighbourhood of [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]].

Situated further north are Range Point, Porter Creek, and Crestview, as well as Whitehorse's newest neighbourhood, Whistle Bend, where most of the new residential growth is currently occurring.\n\nWest of downtown are Valleyview, Hillcrest (also largely constituted of old military lodgings) and the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport; and beyond the [[Canada Games Centre]] along Hamilton Boulevard are the neighbourhoods of McIntyre (designated to replace inferior lands and homes of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation (\"The Village\") previously located where Marwell adjoins a marshy area), then Ingram, Arkell, Logan, Granger, and rapidly expanding Copper Ridge.\n\nWhitehorse also has subdivisions designated \"Country Residential\" which are subject to different municipal bylaws and are located farther out from the downtown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal FAQ|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={ED5E5AB3-9730-489F-8234-4AEB5333001E}|work=Bylaw Services|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> They consist of the rural Whitehorse subdivisions of Hidden Valley and MacPherson at Whitehorse's northern limits; to the south: McCrae (also spelt MacRae), Wolf Creek, Wolf Creek North, Mary Lake, Cowley Creek, Spruce Hill, Pineridge and Fox Haven Estates.<ref>{{cite web|title=try Residential \u2013 Whitehorse|url=http://www.sewp.gov.yk.ca/region?regionId=YK.WH.CNTRYRES|work=Socio-Economic Web Portal|publisher=\u00a9 Yukon Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Also located at the south end of the city is the newly designated Mt.

In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge. By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa.

During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.\n\nIn 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.\n\n===Transportation===\n====Air====\nWhitehorse is served by the [[Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport]] and has scheduled service to [[Vancouver]], [[Kelowna]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Yellowknife]], [[Ottawa]] (via [[Yellowknife]]), [[Dawson City]], [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]], [[Inuvik]], as well as  [[Frankfurt]], Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941\u201342 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal.

The [[Alaska Highway]] is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as \"Highway 1A\" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe city [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon|road]] network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Public transit====\n[[File:Trolley with flags (7041438277).jpg|thumb|The [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] was a [[heritage streetcar]] service that operated from 2000 to 2018.]]\n[[Whitehorse Transit]] provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and on Saturdays during business hours.\n\n{{main|Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley}}\nThere was a waterfront tram, known as [[Whitehorse trolley|the \"trolley\"]], which provided transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it was chiefly tourist-oriented and is not integrated into the municipal transit system.

The trolley system runs on a small portion of the tracks formerly belonging to [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\nThe last scheduled service to Whitehorse from White Pass Railway occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007.

Due to the subsequent period of political and social instability, little additional progress was made in power infrastructure in the country at that time. The total installed capacity before the [[Japanese occupation of China|Japanese occupation]] was only about 10 MW. During the Japanese occupation several large scale hydroelectric projects were built, and total capacity reached 900 MW. Energy infrastructure however suffered heavy damage during the second World War, and the operational capacity after the war was only about 580 MW.<ref name=Kang>{{cite web|last1=Kang|first1=Xiaofeng|title=Hydropower Development in China History and Narratives|url=https://wle-mekong.cgiar.org/download/mk8-improving-hydropower-decision-making-processes-in-the-mekong/Annex%20II%20Hydropower%20Development%20in%20China%20History%20and%20Narratives.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] of 1949, a program of dam construction was initiated. However, most of these dams were built for irrigation and not intended to produce electricity. Moreover, construction was carried out mostly by unskilled peasants. During this period, the steady supply of cheap domestic coal hindered the development of hydroelectricity.<ref name=Kang />\nInstalled hydroelectric capacity grew somewhat after the 1960s, with plants of growing size and complexity, reaching a total of 20 GW in 1980.<ref name=Kang />\n\n==Environmental impact==\nHydropower is considered a renewable and clean energy source. However large dams, such as the [[Three Gorges Dam]] or the [[Xiluodu Dam]] have had environmental impacts on the areas surrounding dam reservoirs. Typical problems have been erosion, flooding of farmland and destruction of fish breeding habitats.\n\nFlooding of large areas for reservoirs also forced about 15 million people to be relocated since 1949.\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Hydroelectric power in China}}\n{{Portal|China|Energy}}\n* [[Renewable energy in China]]\n* [[Solar power in China]]\n* [[Wind power in China]]\n* [[Geothermal power in China]]\n* [[Bioenergy in China]]\n* [[List of renewable energy topics by country|Renewable energy by country]]\n* [[Electricity sector in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Renewable energy by country}}\n{{Asia topic|Hydroelectricity in}}\n\n[[Category:Hydroelectricity in China| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:The Dam (2890371280).jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is the largest power station (of any kind) in the world by installed capacity, with 22.5 GW.]]\nHydroelectricity is currently China's largest renewable energy source and the second overall after coal.<ref name=diplomat>{{cite news|last1=Walker, Qin|title=The Hidden Costs of China's Shift to Hydropower|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/the-hidden-costs-of-chinas-shift-to-hydropower/|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=The Diplomat|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\nChina's installed hydroelectric capacity in 2015 was 319 GW,<ref name=hydropowerorg2016 /> up from 172 GW in 2009, including 23 GW of [[pumped storage hydroelectricity]] capacity.<ref name=hydropowerorg2016 />\nIn 2015, hydropower generated 1,126 TWh of power, accounting for roughly 20% of China's total electricity generation.<ref name=hydropowerorg2016>{{cite web|title=China {{!}} International Hydropower Association|url=https://www.hydropower.org/country-profiles/china|website=www.hydropower.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to China's insufficient reserves of fossil fuels and the government's preference for [[energy independence]], hydropower plays a big part in the energy policy of the country.\nChina's potential hydropower capacity is estimated at up to 600 GW, but currently the technically exploitable and economically feasible capacity is around 500 GW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.our-energy.com/china_hydropower_as_the_right_solution.html|title=China \u2013 hydropower as the right solution?|author=|date=|work=our-energy.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref> There is therefore considerable potential for further hydro development.<ref name=diplomat />\n\nSignificant amount of Chinese hydro-energy is lost due to the need for long transmission lines to connect the remote plants to where demand is most concentrated.<ref name=diplomat /> In November 2018, the government released its third public consultation on their renewable portfolio standard, which sets out provincial wide minimum consumption levels of renewable electricity.

Due to the subsequent period of political and social instability, little additional progress was made in power infrastructure in the country at that time. The total installed capacity before the [[Japanese occupation of China|Japanese occupation]] was only about 10 MW. During the Japanese occupation several large scale hydroelectric projects were built, and total capacity reached 900 MW. Energy infrastructure however suffered heavy damage during the second World War, and the operational capacity after the war was only about 580 MW.<ref name=Kang>{{cite web|last1=Kang|first1=Xiaofeng|title=Hydropower Development in China History and Narratives|url=https://wle-mekong.cgiar.org/download/mk8-improving-hydropower-decision-making-processes-in-the-mekong/Annex%20II%20Hydropower%20Development%20in%20China%20History%20and%20Narratives.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] of 1949, a program of dam construction was initiated. However, most of these dams were built for irrigation and not intended to produce electricity. Moreover, construction was carried out mostly by unskilled peasants. During this period, the steady supply of cheap domestic coal hindered the development of hydroelectricity.<ref name=Kang />\nInstalled hydroelectric capacity grew somewhat after the 1960s, with plants of growing size and complexity, reaching a total of 20 GW in 1980.<ref name=Kang />\n\n==Environmental impact==\nHydropower is considered a renewable and clean energy source. However large dams, such as the [[Three Gorges Dam]] or the [[Xiluodu Dam]] have had environmental impacts on the areas surrounding dam reservoirs. Typical problems have been erosion, flooding of farmland and destruction of fish breeding habitats.\n\nFlooding of large areas for reservoirs also forced about 15 million people to be relocated since 1949.\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Hydroelectric power in China}}\n{{Portal|China|Energy}}\n* [[Renewable energy in China]]\n* [[Solar power in China]]\n* [[Wind power in China]]\n* [[Geothermal power in China]]\n* [[Bioenergy in China]]\n* [[List of renewable energy topics by country|Renewable energy by country]]\n* [[Electricity sector in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Renewable energy by country}}\n{{Asia topic|Hydroelectricity in}}\n\n[[Category:Hydroelectricity in China| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ita140188", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLargest hydroelectric plants:fixed table cells", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity_in_China"}
