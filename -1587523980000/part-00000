On May 2, 1881, Peabody became a partner in the new firm of Spencer Trask & Company. During the 1880s and 1890s this investment house took a leading part in financing electric lighting corporations, beet sugar and other industrial enterprises, and railroad construction in the western United States and Mexico. Peabody himself handled most of the firm's railroad investments, working in close association with [[William J. Palmer]]. He also became a director in numerous corporations.

He was a co-founder, director and treasurer of the [[General Education Board]], the [[Southern Education Board]], and the  Anna T. Jeans Foundation.

In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend [[Edward M.

In 1904 and 1905 he served as treasurer of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson's offer of a place on the [[Federal Trade Commission]], Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] in New York.

In 1924 he invited his friend [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (who had recently contracted a [[Franklin D.

This latter institution was the recipient of much of Peabody's philanthropy, including funds to build a fireproof building to house the university's library.  He also donated land to help reorganize the State College of Agriculture, and founded the university's School of Forestry.\n\n==George Foster Peabody Awards==\nPerhaps Peabody's best-known legacy is the [[Peabody Awards|George Foster Peabody Awards]], presented annually since 1941 by the [[University of Georgia]]'s [[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication]] for excellence in radio, and, since 1948, television broadcasting, followed by [[World Wide Web]] content in the late 1990s.\n\n==Personal life==\nA tall man, in later years he developed a mane of white hair, and wore a heavy mustache and pointed beard, becoming known for his dignified and courtly manner. He maintained a mansion in Brooklyn, where he entertained lavishly. He also purchased a summer home known as Abenia at [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], where he spent most of each year. He was frequently a guest at [[Yaddo]], the Saratoga Springs estate of Spencer Trask and his wife, [[Katrina Trask]], and from both estates he developed a wide circle of influence, including many persons from the literary world, church, business, and government, who came to enjoy his gracious hospitality.\n\nA longtime bachelor, in 1920, eleven years after Trask's death in a railroad accident, Peabody married Trask's widow [[Katrina Trask|Katrina]], and they lived at Yaddo until her death in 1922. Thereafter Yaddo became a great retreat for artists. Peabody continued to live on the estate, and in 1926 he adopted a daughter, Mrs. Marjorie P.

During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase \"When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta...\"{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to support quotation|date=March 2020}} The term therefore connotes a being who is \"bound for enlightenment\", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the [[P\u0101li Canon|P\u0101li canon]], the bodhisatta (bodhisattva) is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the [[Jataka tales]].\n\nAccording to the [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]] monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali [[Nikayas]] (and their counterparts such as the Chinese [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0100gamas]]) which instead focus on the ideal of the [[Arahant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/arahantsbodhisattvas.html|title=Arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest known story about how [[Gautama Buddha]] becomes a bodhisattva is the story of his encounter with the previous Buddha, [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]]. During this encounter, a previous incarnation of Gautama, variously named [[Sumedha|Sumedha, Megha, or Sumati]] offers five blue lotuses and spreads out his hair or entire body for [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]] to walk on, resolving to one day become a Buddha. [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]] then confirms that they will attain [[Buddhahood]].<ref name=\":0\">Drewes, David, ''[https://www.academia.edu/34935437/Mahayana_Sutras_and_the_Opening_of_the_Bodhisattva_Path_Updated_2019_?email_work_card=title Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path]'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.<br /></ref> Early Buddhist authors saw this story as indicating that the making of a resolution (''abhin\u012bh\u0101ra'') in the presence of a living Buddha and his prediction/confirmation of one's future Buddhahood was necessary to become a bodhisattva. According to Drewes, \"all known models of the path to Buddhahood developed from this basic understanding.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe path is explained differently by the various [[Nikaya Buddhism|Nikaya schools]]. In the Therav\u0101da ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' (1st-2nd century BCE), after receiving the prediction, Gautama took four [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43kheyyas'']] (\"incalculable aeons\") and a hundred thousand, shorter [[Kalpa (aeon)|''kalpas'']] (aeons) to reach Buddhahood.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school had similar models about how the Buddha Gautama became a bodhisattva. They held it took him three [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43khyeyas'']] and ninety one ''kalpas'' (aeons) to become a Buddha after his resolution (''pra\u1e47idh\u0101na'') in front of a past Buddha. During the first ''[[asa\u1e43khyeya]]'' he is said to have encountered and served 75,000 Buddhas, and 76,000 in the second, after which he received his first prediction (''vy\u0101kara\u1e47a'') of future Buddhahood from [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]], meaning that he could no longer fall back from the path to Buddhahood.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, the presence of a living Buddha is also necessary for [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]]. The [[Mahavibhasa|''Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101'']] explains that its discussion of the bodhisattva path is partly meant \"to stop those who are in fact not bodhisattvas from giving rise to the self-conceit that they are.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'' of the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]]-[[Lokottarav\u0101da|Lokottarav\u0101dins]] presents four stages of the bodhisattva path without giving specific time frames (though its said to take various [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43khyeya kalpas'']]):<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n# Natural (''prak\u1e5bti''), one first plants the roots of merit in front of a Buddha to attain Buddhahood.\n# Resolution (''pra\u1e47idh\u0101na''), one makes their first resolution to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha.\n# Continuing (''anuloma''), one continues to practice until one meets a Buddha who confirms one's future Buddhahood.\n# Irreversible (''anivartana''), at this stage, one cannot fall back.\n\n=== Later Therav\u0101da ===\nThe [[Sri Lankan Buddhism|Sri Lankan]] commentator [[Dhammap\u0101la|Dhammapala]] in his commentary on the ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka]]'', a text which focuses on the bodhisattva path, notes that to become a bodhisattva one must make a valid resolution in front of a living Buddha, which confirms that one is irreversible (''anivattana'') from the attainment of Buddhahood. The [[Jataka tales|''Nid\u0101nakath\u0101'']], as well as the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka]]'' commentaries makes this explicit by stating that one cannot use a substitute (such as a [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi tree]], [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]] or [[Stupa]]) for the presence of a living Buddha, since only a Buddha has the knowledge for making a reliable prediction. This is the generally accepted view maintained in orthodox [[Theravada]] today.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea is that any resolution to attain Buddhahood may easily be forgotten or abandoned during the aeons ahead. The Burmese monk [[Ledi Sayadaw]] (1846\u20131923) explains that though it is easy to make vows for future Buddhahood by oneself, it is very difficult to maintain the necessary conduct and views during periods when the Dharma has disappeared from the world. One will easily fall back during such periods and this is why one is not truly a full bodhisattva until one receives recognition from a living Buddha.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBecause of this, it was and remains a common practice in Theravada to attempt to establish the necessary conditions to meet the future Buddha [[Maitreya]] and thus receive a prediction from him. Medieval Theravada literature and inscriptions report the aspirations of monks, kings and ministers to meet Maitreya for this purpose. Modern figures such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864\u20131933), and [[U Nu]] (1907\u20131995) both sought to receive a prediction from a Buddha in the future and believed meritorious actions done for the good of Buddhism would help in their endeavor to become bodhisattvas in the future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOver time the term came to be applied to other figures besides Gautama Buddha in Theravada lands, possibly due to the influence of [[Mahayana]]. The Theravada [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra|Abhayagiri]] tradition of Sri Lanka practiced Mahayana Buddhism and was very influential until the 12th century.<ref>Hoiberg, Dale H., ed.

According to David Drewes, \"Mahayana sutras unanimously depict the path beginning with the first arising of the thought of becoming a Buddha (''prathamacittotp\u0101da''), or the initial arising of ''[[bodhicitta]]'', typically aeons before one first receives a Buddha\u2019s prediction, and apply the term bodhisattva from this point.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''{{IAST|[[A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]}}'', one of the earliest known Mahayana texts, contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mah\u0101y\u0101na definition.<ref>Mall, Linnart.

''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.</ref>\n\nThe ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'', also divides the path into three stages. The first stage is that of bodhisattvas who \u201cfirst set out in the vehicle\u201d (''prathamay\u0101nasa\u1e43prasthita''), then there is the \u201cirreversible\u201d (''avinivartan\u012bya'') stage, and finally the third \u201cbound by one more birth\u201d (''ekaj\u0101tipratibaddha''), as in, destined to become a Buddha in the next life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Drewes also notes that:<blockquote>When Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras present stories of Buddhas and bodhisattvas\u2019 first arising of the thought of attaining Buddhahood, they invariably depict it as taking place in the presence of a Buddha, suggesting that they shared with all known nik\u0101ya traditions the understanding that this is a necessary condition for entering the path. In addition, though this key fact is often obscured in scholarship, they apparently never encourage anyone to become a bodhisattva or present any ritual or other means of doing so. Like nik\u0101ya texts, they also regard the status of new or recent bodhisattvas as largely meaningless. The ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'', for instance, states that as many bodhisattvas as there grains of sand in the Ganges turn back from the pursuit of Buddhahood and that out of innumerable beings who give rise to bodhicitta and progress toward Buddhahood, only one or two will reach the point of becoming irreversible.<ref name=\":0\" /> </blockquote>\n\nDrewes also adds that early texts like the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'' treat bodhisattvas who are beginners (''\u0101dikarmika'') or \"not long set out in the [great] vehicle\" with scorn, describing them as \"blind\", \"unintelligent\", \"lazy\" and \"weak\". Early Mahayana works identify them with those who reject Mahayana or who abandon Mahayana, and they are seen as likely to become ''[[\u015br\u0101vaka]]s''  (those on the ''[[arhat]]'' path). Rather than encouraging them to become bodhisattvas, what early Mahayana sutras like the ''A\u1e63\u1e6da'' do is to help individuals determine if they have already received a prediction in a past life, or if they are close to this point.<ref name=\":0\" /> The ''A\u1e63\u1e6da'' provides a variety of methods, including forms of ritual or [[divination]], [[Dream interpretation|methods dealing with dreams]] and various tests, especially tests based on one's reaction to the hearing of the content in the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'' itself. The text states that encountering and accepting its teachings mean one is close to being given a prediction and that if one does not \"shrink back, cower or despair\" from the text, but \"firmly believes it\", one is irreversible. Many other Mahayana sutras such as the ''Ak\u1e63obhyavy\u016bha'' and the ''[[\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama Sam\u0101dhi S\u016btra|\u015a\u016bra\u1e43gamasam\u0101dhi S\u016btra]]'' present textual approaches to determine one's status as an advanced bodhisattva. These mainly consist in one's attitude towards listening to, believing, preaching, proclaiming, copying or memorizing and reciting the sutra.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to Drewes, this claim that merely having faith in Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras meant that one was an advanced bodhisattva, was a departure from previous Nikaya views about bodhisattvas. It created new groups of Buddhists who accepted each other's bodhisattva status.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome of early depictions of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the ''[[Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra]]'' describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of bodhisattvas are mentioned: the forest, city, and monastery bodhisattvas\u2014with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the ''Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101'' and the [[Samadhiraja Sutra|''Samadhiraja'']] sutras.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 252.</ref> The early ''Rastrapalapariprccha sutra'' also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The ''Rastrapala'' is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 265.</ref> The ''Ratnagunasamcayagatha'' also says the bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices (''[[dhutanga]]''), \"wander freely without a home\", practice the [[paramitas]] and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of [[prajnaparamita|''praj\u00f1aparamita'']].<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 255.</ref> Some scholars have used these texts to argue for \"the forest hypothesis\", the theory that the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest [[asceticism]]. But other scholars point out that many other Mahayana sutras do not promote this ideal, focusing on sutra based practices.<ref name=\":1\">Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, ''Religion Compass'' 4/2 (2010): 66\u201374, {{doi|10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x}}</ref>\n\nSome Mahayana sutras promoted another revolutionary doctrinal turn, claiming that the three vehicles of the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na]], [[Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na]]'' and the ''[[Bodhisattvay\u0101na]]'' were really just one vehicle (''[[Ekay\u0101na|ekayana]]''). This is most famously promoted in the ''[[Lotus S\u016btra]]'' which claims that the very idea of three separate vehicles is just an ''[[upaya]]'', a skillful device invented by the Buddha to get beings of various abilities on the path. But ultimately, it will be revealed to them that there is only one vehicle, the ''[[Ekay\u0101na|ekayana]]'', which ends in Buddhahood.<ref>Silk, Jonathan; Hin\u00fcber, Oskar von; Eltschinger, Vincent; eds. (2016). \"Lotus Sutra\", in Brill's Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Volume 1: Literature and Languages. Leiden: Brill. p.&nbsp;147</ref>\n\n=== Mature Mah\u0101y\u0101na ===\nOver time, Mahayana Buddhists developed mature systematized doctrines about the bodhisattva path. The authors of the various [[Madhyamaka]] shastras (treatises) often presented the view of the [[Ekay\u0101na|''ekayana'']]. The texts and sutras associated with the [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] school developed a different theory of three separate ''gotras'' or lineages, that inherently predisposed a person to either the vehicle of the ''[[arhat]]'', ''[[pratyekabuddha]]'' or [[Buddhahood|''samyak-sa\u1e43buddha'']] (fully self awakened one).<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the term was also used in a broader sense. According to the eight century Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosopher [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]], the term \"bodhisattva\" can refer to those who follow any of the three vehicles, since all are working towards ''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism|bodhi]]'' (awakening). Therefore, the specific term for a Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva is a ''mah\u0101sattva'' (great being) ''bodhisattva''.<ref name=\":11\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 55.</ref> According to [[Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th century ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa]],'' the central defining feature of a Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva is the universal aspiration to end suffering for all sentient beings, which is termed ''[[bodhicitta]]'' (the heart set on awakening).<ref name=\":13\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> Later Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhists also developed specific rituals and devotional acts for the arising of this absolutely central quality of ''bodhicitta'', such as the \"seven part worship\" (''Sapt\u0101\u1e47gap\u016bj\u0101'' or ''Saptavidh\u0101 Anuttarap\u016bj\u0101''). This ritual form is visible in the works of [[Shantideva]] (8th century) and includes:<ref>Har Dayal, ''The Bodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature,'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999, p. 54.</ref>\n\n* ''Vandana'' (obeisance, bowing down)\n* ''[[Puja (Buddhism)|Puja]]'' (worship of the Buddhas)\n* ''Sarana-gamana'' (going for [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]])\n* ''Papadesana'' (confession of bad deeds)\n* ''Punyanumodana'' (rejoicing in merit of the good deeds of oneself and others) \n* ''Adhyesana'' (prayer, entreaty) and ''yacana'' (supplication) \u2013 request to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to continue preaching Dharma\n* ''Atmabhavadi-parityagah'' (surrender)\n\nContemporary Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism follows this model and encourages everyone to give rise to bodhicitta and ceremonially take [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the transcendent virtues or [[P\u0101ramit\u0101|paramitas]].<ref>''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pp. 4\u201312, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}</ref>\n\nRelated to the different views on the different types of [[Yana (Buddhism)|''yanas'']] or vehicles is the question of a bodhisattva's relationship to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]. In the various Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, two theories can be discerned. One view is the idea that a bodhisattva must postpone their awakening until full Buddhahood is attained (at which point one ceases to be reborn, which is the classical view of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]). This view is promoted in some sutras like the ''Pa\u00f1cavimsatisahasrika-praj\u00f1aparamita-sutra.<ref name=\":10\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 59\u201360.</ref>'' The second theory is the idea that there are two kinds of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]], the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] of an arhat and a superior type of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] called [[Nirvana (Buddhism)#Aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita nirv\u0101na|''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita (''non-abiding)]] that allows a Buddha to remain engaged in the world. This doctrine developed in [[Yogachara|Yogacara]]. As noted by Paul Williams, the idea of ''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' may have taken some time to develop and is not obvious in some of the early Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature, therefore while earlier sutras may sometimes speak of \"postponement\", later texts saw no need to postpone the \"superior\" ''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]''.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn this Yogacara model, the bodhisattva definitely rejects and avoids the liberation of the ''\u015bravaka'' and ''pratyekabuddha'', described in Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature as either inferior or \"[[Hinayana|''Hina'']]\" (as in [[Asa\u1e45ga]]'s fourth century ''[[Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi]]'') or as ultimately false or illusory (as in the ''Lotus S\u016btra'').<ref>\"bodhisattva\" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 135.</ref> That a bodhisattva has the option to pursue such a lesser path, but instead chooses the long path towards Buddhahood is one of the five criteria for one to be considered a bodhisattva. The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a Buddha in the presence of a previous Buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that Buddha.\n\nOver time, a more varied analysis of bodhisattva careers developed focused on one's motivation. This can be seen in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to [[Patrul Rinpoche]]'s 19th century ''Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (''Kun bzang bla ma'i gzhal lung''), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:\n\n# King-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.\n# Boatman-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.\n# Shepherd-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.\n\nThese three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which Buddhahood actually occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.<ref>''Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of A Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.'' Translated by The Padmakara Translation Group. (Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1994), 218.</ref> The ritualized formulation of the bodhisattva vow also reflects this order (becoming a buddha so that one can then teach others to do the same). A bodhisattva vow ritual text attributed to [[N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]], of the second-third century CE, states the vow as follows: \"Just as the past tath\u0101gata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom.\"<ref>Nag\u0101rjuna.

The six perfections are a mental transformation and need not actually benefit anyone. This is seen in the story of [[Vessantara]], an incarnation of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha while he was still a bodhisattva, who commits the ultimate act of generosity by giving away his children to an evil man who mistreats them. Vessantara's generous act causes indirect harm, however, the merit from the perfection of his generosity fructifies when he attains complete enlightenment as \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha.<ref>\"Vessantara\" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 965.</ref>\n\n===Bodhisattva grounds or levels===\n\nAccording to many traditions within Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bh\u016bmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bh\u016bmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'' and ''[[The Jewel Ornament of Liberation]],'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)\n\nBefore a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:\n#the path of accumulation\n#the path of preparation\n\nThe ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths:\n#''bh\u016bmi'' 1 the path of insight\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 2\u20137 the path of meditation\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 8\u201310 the path of no more learning\n\nThe chapter of ten grounds in the ''Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:\n\n#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bh\u016bmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''p\u0101ramit\u0101s''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''d\u0101na'').\n#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bh\u016bmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bh\u016bmi'' is named \"stainless\". The emphasized perfection is [[\u015bila|moral discipline]] (''\u015b\u012bla'').\n#'''Luminous:''' The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third ''bh\u016bmi''.

Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokite\u015bvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n\nThe place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[Dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das. Perhaps the most famous bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da of all is the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|\u015a\u0101kyamu\u1e47i]] achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of [[Chinese Buddhism]], there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople.

During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase \"When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta...\"{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to support quotation|date=March 2020}} The term therefore connotes a being who is \"bound for enlightenment\", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the [[P\u0101li Canon|P\u0101li canon]], the bodhisatta (bodhisattva) is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the [[Jataka tales]].\n\nAccording to the [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]] monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali [[Nikayas]] (and their counterparts such as the Chinese [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0100gamas]]) which instead focus on the ideal of the [[Arahant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/arahantsbodhisattvas.html|title=Arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest known story about how [[Gautama Buddha]] becomes a bodhisattva is the story of his encounter with the previous Buddha, [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]]. During this encounter, a previous incarnation of Gautama, variously named [[Sumedha|Sumedha, Megha, or Sumati]] offers five blue lotuses and spreads out his hair or entire body for [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]] to walk on, resolving to one day become a Buddha. [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]] then confirms that they will attain [[Buddhahood]].<ref name=\":0\">Drewes, David, ''[https://www.academia.edu/34935437/Mahayana_Sutras_and_the_Opening_of_the_Bodhisattva_Path_Updated_2019_?email_work_card=title Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path]'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.<br /></ref> Early Buddhist authors saw this story as indicating that the making of a resolution (''abhin\u012bh\u0101ra'') in the presence of a living Buddha and his prediction/confirmation of one's future Buddhahood was necessary to become a bodhisattva. According to Drewes, \"all known models of the path to Buddhahood developed from this basic understanding.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe path is explained differently by the various [[Nikaya Buddhism|Nikaya schools]]. In the Therav\u0101da ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' (1st-2nd century BCE), after receiving the prediction, Gautama took four [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43kheyyas'']] (\"incalculable aeons\") and a hundred thousand, shorter [[Kalpa (aeon)|''kalpas'']] (aeons) to reach Buddhahood.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school had similar models about how the Buddha Gautama became a bodhisattva. They held it took him three [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43khyeyas'']] and ninety one ''kalpas'' (aeons) to become a Buddha after his resolution (''pra\u1e47idh\u0101na'') in front of a past Buddha. During the first ''[[asa\u1e43khyeya]]'' he is said to have encountered and served 75,000 Buddhas, and 76,000 in the second, after which he received his first prediction (''vy\u0101kara\u1e47a'') of future Buddhahood from [[D\u012bpankara Buddha|D\u012bpankara]], meaning that he could no longer fall back from the path to Buddhahood.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, the presence of a living Buddha is also necessary for [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]]. The [[Mahavibhasa|''Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101'']] explains that its discussion of the bodhisattva path is partly meant \"to stop those who are in fact not bodhisattvas from giving rise to the self-conceit that they are.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'' of the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]]-[[Lokottarav\u0101da|Lokottarav\u0101dins]] presents four stages of the bodhisattva path without giving specific time frames (though its said to take various [[Asa\u1e43khyeya|''asa\u1e43khyeya kalpas'']]):<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n# Natural (''prak\u1e5bti''), one first plants the roots of merit in front of a Buddha to attain Buddhahood.\n# Resolution (''pra\u1e47idh\u0101na''), one makes their first resolution to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha.\n# Continuing (''anuloma''), one continues to practice until one meets a Buddha who confirms one's future Buddhahood.\n# Irreversible (''anivartana''), at this stage, one cannot fall back.\n\n=== Later Therav\u0101da ===\nThe [[Sri Lankan Buddhism|Sri Lankan]] commentator [[Dhammap\u0101la|Dhammapala]] in his commentary on the ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka]]'', a text which focuses on the bodhisattva path, notes that to become a bodhisattva one must make a valid resolution in front of a living Buddha, which confirms that one is irreversible (''anivattana'') from the attainment of Buddhahood. The [[Jataka tales|''Nid\u0101nakath\u0101'']], as well as the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka]]'' commentaries makes this explicit by stating that one cannot use a substitute (such as a [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi tree]], [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]] or [[Stupa]]) for the presence of a living Buddha, since only a Buddha has the knowledge for making a reliable prediction. This is the generally accepted view maintained in orthodox [[Theravada]] today.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea is that any resolution to attain Buddhahood may easily be forgotten or abandoned during the aeons ahead. The Burmese monk [[Ledi Sayadaw]] (1846\u20131923) explains that though it is easy to make vows for future Buddhahood by oneself, it is very difficult to maintain the necessary conduct and views during periods when the Dharma has disappeared from the world. One will easily fall back during such periods and this is why one is not truly a full bodhisattva until one receives recognition from a living Buddha.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBecause of this, it was and remains a common practice in Theravada to attempt to establish the necessary conditions to meet the future Buddha [[Maitreya]] and thus receive a prediction from him. Medieval Theravada literature and inscriptions report the aspirations of monks, kings and ministers to meet Maitreya for this purpose. Modern figures such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864\u20131933), and [[U Nu]] (1907\u20131995) both sought to receive a prediction from a Buddha in the future and believed meritorious actions done for the good of Buddhism would help in their endeavor to become bodhisattvas in the future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOver time the term came to be applied to other figures besides Gautama Buddha in Theravada lands, possibly due to the influence of [[Mahayana]]. The Theravada [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra|Abhayagiri]] tradition of Sri Lanka practiced Mahayana Buddhism and was very influential until the 12th century.<ref>Hoiberg, Dale H., ed.

He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs#House of Lambakanna II .28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956\u2013972 CE), who had the words inscribed \"none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka,\" among other examples.<ref>Holt, John.

According to David Drewes, \"Mahayana sutras unanimously depict the path beginning with the first arising of the thought of becoming a Buddha (''prathamacittotp\u0101da''), or the initial arising of ''[[bodhicitta]]'', typically aeons before one first receives a Buddha\u2019s prediction, and apply the term bodhisattva from this point.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''{{IAST|[[A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]}}'', one of the earliest known Mahayana texts, contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mah\u0101y\u0101na definition.<ref>Mall, Linnart.

''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.</ref>\n\nThe ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'', also divides the path into three stages. The first stage is that of bodhisattvas who \u201cfirst set out in the vehicle\u201d (''prathamay\u0101nasa\u1e43prasthita''), then there is the \u201cirreversible\u201d (''avinivartan\u012bya'') stage, and finally the third \u201cbound by one more birth\u201d (''ekaj\u0101tipratibaddha''), as in, destined to become a Buddha in the next life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Drewes also notes that:<blockquote>When Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras present stories of Buddhas and bodhisattvas\u2019 first arising of the thought of attaining Buddhahood, they invariably depict it as taking place in the presence of a Buddha, suggesting that they shared with all known nik\u0101ya traditions the understanding that this is a necessary condition for entering the path. In addition, though this key fact is often obscured in scholarship, they apparently never encourage anyone to become a bodhisattva or present any ritual or other means of doing so. Like nik\u0101ya texts, they also regard the status of new or recent bodhisattvas as largely meaningless. The ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'', for instance, states that as many bodhisattvas as there grains of sand in the Ganges turn back from the pursuit of Buddhahood and that out of innumerable beings who give rise to bodhicitta and progress toward Buddhahood, only one or two will reach the point of becoming irreversible.<ref name=\":0\" /> </blockquote>\n\nDrewes also adds that early texts like the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'' treat bodhisattvas who are beginners (''\u0101dikarmika'') or \"not long set out in the [great] vehicle\" with scorn, describing them as \"blind\", \"unintelligent\", \"lazy\" and \"weak\". Early Mahayana works identify them with those who reject Mahayana or who abandon Mahayana, and they are seen as likely to become ''[[\u015br\u0101vaka]]s''  (those on the ''[[arhat]]'' path). Rather than encouraging them to become bodhisattvas, what early Mahayana sutras like the ''A\u1e63\u1e6da'' do is to help individuals determine if they have already received a prediction in a past life, or if they are close to this point.<ref name=\":0\" /> The ''A\u1e63\u1e6da'' provides a variety of methods, including forms of ritual or [[divination]], [[Dream interpretation|methods dealing with dreams]] and various tests, especially tests based on one's reaction to the hearing of the content in the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101'' itself. The text states that encountering and accepting its teachings mean one is close to being given a prediction and that if one does not \"shrink back, cower or despair\" from the text, but \"firmly believes it\", one is irreversible. Many other Mahayana sutras such as the ''Ak\u1e63obhyavy\u016bha'' and the ''[[\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama Sam\u0101dhi S\u016btra|\u015a\u016bra\u1e43gamasam\u0101dhi S\u016btra]]'' present textual approaches to determine one's status as an advanced bodhisattva. These mainly consist in one's attitude towards listening to, believing, preaching, proclaiming, copying or memorizing and reciting the sutra.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to Drewes, this claim that merely having faith in Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras meant that one was an advanced bodhisattva, was a departure from previous Nikaya views about bodhisattvas. It created new groups of Buddhists who accepted each other's bodhisattva status.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome of early depictions of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the ''[[Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra]]'' describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of bodhisattvas are mentioned: the forest, city, and monastery bodhisattvas\u2014with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the ''Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101'' and the [[Samadhiraja Sutra|''Samadhiraja'']] sutras.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 252.</ref> The early ''Rastrapalapariprccha sutra'' also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The ''Rastrapala'' is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 265.</ref> The ''Ratnagunasamcayagatha'' also says the bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices (''[[dhutanga]]''), \"wander freely without a home\", practice the [[paramitas]] and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of [[prajnaparamita|''praj\u00f1aparamita'']].<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, p. 255.</ref> Some scholars have used these texts to argue for \"the forest hypothesis\", the theory that the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest [[asceticism]]. But other scholars point out that many other Mahayana sutras do not promote this ideal, focusing on sutra based practices.<ref name=\":1\">Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, ''Religion Compass'' 4/2 (2010): 66\u201374, {{doi|10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x}}</ref>\n\nSome Mahayana sutras promoted another revolutionary doctrinal turn, claiming that the three vehicles of the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na]], [[Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na]]'' and the ''[[Bodhisattvay\u0101na]]'' were really just one vehicle (''[[Ekay\u0101na|ekayana]]''). This is most famously promoted in the ''[[Lotus S\u016btra]]'' which claims that the very idea of three separate vehicles is just an ''[[upaya]]'', a skillful device invented by the Buddha to get beings of various abilities on the path. But ultimately, it will be revealed to them that there is only one vehicle, the ''[[Ekay\u0101na|ekayana]]'', which ends in Buddhahood.<ref>Silk, Jonathan; Hin\u00fcber, Oskar von; Eltschinger, Vincent; eds. (2016). \"Lotus Sutra\", in Brill's Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Volume 1: Literature and Languages. Leiden: Brill. p.&nbsp;147</ref>\n\n=== Mature Mah\u0101y\u0101na ===\nOver time, Mahayana Buddhists developed mature systematized doctrines about the bodhisattva path. The authors of the various [[Madhyamaka]] shastras (treatises) often presented the view of the [[Ekay\u0101na|''ekayana'']]. The texts and sutras associated with the [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] school developed a different theory of three separate ''gotras'' or lineages, that inherently predisposed a person to either the vehicle of the ''[[arhat]]'', ''[[pratyekabuddha]]'' or [[Buddhahood|''samyak-sa\u1e43buddha'']] (fully self awakened one).<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the term was also used in a broader sense. According to the eight century Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosopher [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]], the term \"bodhisattva\" can refer to those who follow any of the three vehicles, since all are working towards ''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism|bodhi]]'' (awakening). Therefore, the specific term for a Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva is a ''mah\u0101sattva'' (great being) ''bodhisattva''.<ref name=\":11\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 55.</ref> According to [[Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th century ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa]],'' the central defining feature of a Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva is the universal aspiration to end suffering for all sentient beings, which is termed ''[[bodhicitta]]'' (the heart set on awakening).<ref name=\":13\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> Later Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhists also developed specific rituals and devotional acts for the arising of this absolutely central quality of ''bodhicitta'', such as the \"seven part worship\" (''Sapt\u0101\u1e47gap\u016bj\u0101'' or ''Saptavidh\u0101 Anuttarap\u016bj\u0101''). This ritual form is visible in the works of [[Shantideva]] (8th century) and includes:<ref>Har Dayal, ''The Bodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature,'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999, p. 54.</ref>\n\n* ''Vandana'' (obeisance, bowing down)\n* ''[[Puja (Buddhism)|Puja]]'' (worship of the Buddhas)\n* ''Sarana-gamana'' (going for [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]])\n* ''Papadesana'' (confession of bad deeds)\n* ''Punyanumodana'' (rejoicing in merit of the good deeds of oneself and others) \n* ''Adhyesana'' (prayer, entreaty) and ''yacana'' (supplication) \u2013 request to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to continue preaching Dharma\n* ''Atmabhavadi-parityagah'' (surrender)\n\nContemporary Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism follows this model and encourages everyone to give rise to bodhicitta and ceremonially take [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the transcendent virtues or [[P\u0101ramit\u0101|paramitas]].<ref>''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pp. 4\u201312, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}</ref>\n\nRelated to the different views on the different types of [[Yana (Buddhism)|''yanas'']] or vehicles is the question of a bodhisattva's relationship to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]. In the various Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, two theories can be discerned. One view is the idea that a bodhisattva must postpone their awakening until full Buddhahood is attained (at which point one ceases to be reborn, which is the classical view of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]). This view is promoted in some sutras like the ''Pa\u00f1cavimsatisahasrika-praj\u00f1aparamita-sutra.<ref name=\":10\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 59\u201360.</ref>'' The second theory is the idea that there are two kinds of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]], the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] of an arhat and a superior type of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] called [[Nirvana (Buddhism)#Aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita nirv\u0101na|''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita (''non-abiding)]] that allows a Buddha to remain engaged in the world. This doctrine developed in [[Yogachara|Yogacara]]. As noted by Paul Williams, the idea of ''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' may have taken some time to develop and is not obvious in some of the early Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature, therefore while earlier sutras may sometimes speak of \"postponement\", later texts saw no need to postpone the \"superior\" ''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirv\u0101\u1e47a]]''.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn this Yogacara model, the bodhisattva definitely rejects and avoids the liberation of the ''\u015bravaka'' and ''pratyekabuddha'', described in Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature as either inferior or \"[[Hinayana|''Hina'']]\" (as in [[Asa\u1e45ga]]'s fourth century ''[[Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi]]'') or as ultimately false or illusory (as in the ''Lotus S\u016btra'').<ref>\"bodhisattva\" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 135.</ref> That a bodhisattva has the option to pursue such a lesser path, but instead chooses the long path towards Buddhahood is one of the five criteria for one to be considered a bodhisattva. The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a Buddha in the presence of a previous Buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that Buddha.\n\nOver time, a more varied analysis of bodhisattva careers developed focused on one's motivation. This can be seen in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to [[Patrul Rinpoche]]'s 19th century ''Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (''Kun bzang bla ma'i gzhal lung''), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:\n\n# King-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.\n# Boatman-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.\n# Shepherd-like bodhicitta \u2013 To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.\n\nThese three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which Buddhahood actually occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.<ref>''Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of A Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.'' Translated by The Padmakara Translation Group. (Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1994), 218.</ref> The ritualized formulation of the bodhisattva vow also reflects this order (becoming a buddha so that one can then teach others to do the same). A bodhisattva vow ritual text attributed to [[N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]], of the second-third century CE, states the vow as follows: \"Just as the past tath\u0101gata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom.\"<ref>Nag\u0101rjuna.

The six perfections are a mental transformation and need not actually benefit anyone. This is seen in the story of [[Vessantara]], an incarnation of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha while he was still a bodhisattva, who commits the ultimate act of generosity by giving away his children to an evil man who mistreats them. Vessantara's generous act causes indirect harm, however, the merit from the perfection of his generosity fructifies when he attains complete enlightenment as \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha.<ref>\"Vessantara\" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 965.</ref>\n\n===Bodhisattva grounds or levels===\n\nAccording to many traditions within Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bh\u016bmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bh\u016bmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'' and ''[[The Jewel Ornament of Liberation]],'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)\n\nBefore a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:\n#the path of accumulation\n#the path of preparation\n\nThe ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths:\n#''bh\u016bmi'' 1 the path of insight\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 2\u20137 the path of meditation\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 8\u201310 the path of no more learning\n\nThe chapter of ten grounds in the ''Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:\n\n#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bh\u016bmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''p\u0101ramit\u0101s''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''d\u0101na'').\n#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bh\u016bmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bh\u016bmi'' is named \"stainless\". The emphasized perfection is [[\u015bila|moral discipline]] (''\u015b\u012bla'').\n#'''Luminous:''' The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third ''bh\u016bmi''. The emphasized perfection is [[k\u1e63anti|patience]] (''{{IAST|k\u1e63\u0101nti}}'').\n#'''Radiant:''' This ''bh\u016bmi'' it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[v\u012brya|vigor]] (''v\u012brya'').\n#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhy\u0101na'').\n#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra|{{IAST|sa\u1e43s\u0101ra}}]]'' or ''[[nirv\u0101\u1e47a|{{IAST|nirv\u0101\u1e47a}}]]'', so this state is \"obviously transcendent\".  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''praj\u00f1\u0101'').\n#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skillful means]] (''up\u0101ya''), to help others.\n#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This \"immovable\" ''bh\u016bmi'' is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.\n#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is the understanding of self and non-self.\n#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.\n\nAfter the ten ''bh\u016bmis'', according to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.\n\nWith the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra]]'' recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajray\u0101na]] schools recognize 3\u201310 additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|title=\u5927\u5706\u6ee1\u5fc3\u6027\u4f11\u606f \u2013 \u663e\u5bc6\u6587\u5e93 \u4f5b\u6559\u6587\u96c6|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908080747/http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|archive-date=8 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html|title=\u5409\u7965\u9114\u91d1\u5bc6\u56b4\u5bfa|author=\u9114\u91d1\u65fa\u5ea6|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nA bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[mah\u0101sattva]]''.

Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokite\u015bvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n\nThe place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[Dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das. Perhaps the most famous bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da of all is the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|\u015a\u0101kyamu\u1e47i]] achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of [[Chinese Buddhism]], there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople. These four bodhimandas are:\n\n* [[Putuoshan|Mount Putuo]]:  [[Avalokite\u015bvara]], Bodhisattva of Compassion.

This is probably in accordance to the description of Prince [[Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]] as a bodhisattva. The depiction of bodhisattva in Buddhist art around the world aspire to express the bodhisattva's quality; loving-kindness (''metta''), compassion (''karuna''), empathetic joy (''mudita'') and equanimity (''upekkha'').<ref name=\"Flanagan\"/>\n\nGender variant representations of some bodhisattvas, most notably [[Avalokite\u015bvara]], has prompted conversation regarding the nature of a bodhisattva's appearance. Chan master [[Sheng Yen]] has stated that [[Mah\u0101sattva]]s such as Avalokite\u015bvara (known as [[Guanyin]] in Chinese) are androgynous (Ch. \u4e2d\u6027; [[pinyin]]: \"zh\u014dngx\u00ecng\"), which accounts for their ability to manifest in masculine and feminine forms of various degrees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheng Yen |title=\u5723\u4e25\u6cd5\u5e08\u300a\u89c2\u4e16\u97f3\u83e9\u8428\u7684\u6027\u522b\u300b |url=http://fodizi.net/qt/shengyanfashi/1299.html |website=\u4f5b\u5f1f\u5b50\u6587\u5e93 |accessdate=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWhile bodhisattvas tend to be depicted as conventionally [[beauty|beautiful]], there are instances of their manifestation as wrathful and [[monstrous]] beings.

It is the fourth oldest western style lighthouse to be built in Japan, and the second oldest surviving to the present day.\n\n== History ==\nThe J\u014dgashima Lighthouse was one of eight lighthouses built in Japan under the provisions of the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] of 1858, signed by the [[Bakumatsu period]] [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. The lighthouse was designed and constructed by [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|expatriate French engineer]] [[L\u00e9once Verny]]. Verny constructed another three lighthouses around [[Tokyo Bay]], and was also the engineer who built the nearby [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] during his career in Japan.\n\n[[File:MisakiHarbour.jpg|thumb|left|The lighthouse on top of J\u014dgashima (seen here at the center of the photograph, from [[Misaki, Kanagawa|Misaki harbour]]).]]\nThe J\u014dgashima Lighthouse was completed on September 8, 1870 after the [[Meiji Restoration]], and was originally built of brick. The original structure was destroyed during the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] on September 1, 1923 and was replaced with the current reinforced-[[concrete]] round structure on August 1, 1925. In 1928, its light source was changed from [[acetylene]] to electric, greatly increasing its visibility.  The lighthouse has been unmanned since 1991.  It is currently maintained by the [[Japan Coast Guard]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Japan|Engineering}}}}\n* [[List of lighthouses in Japan]]\n\n== References ==\n*Pedlar, Neil.
