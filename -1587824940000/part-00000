This signalled the dawn of the proto-historic period and this immigration continued into the ancient and Medieval periods. These were the group of Dravidian Nadiyals came during Kamarupa. At the end of the ancient period (c1205), the first Muslims (Wave 4), captive soldiers of the defeated Bakhtiar Khilji, settled in the Hajo area.\n\n===Medieval===\nThe next major immigrants were the [[Ahom people|Tai-Ahoms]] (Wave 5) when [[Sukaphaa]] lead his group into Assam via the [[Pangsau Pass]] in the [[Patkai]] from South China. The [[Tai-Ahoms]] were followed by other [[Tai peoples]] who were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (Wave 6): [[Khamti people|Khamti]], [[Khamyang people|Khamyang]], Aiton, [[Tai Phake people|Tai Phake]] and [[Turung people]]s, who settled in Upper Assam and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This continued well into the colonial times.  At the end of the Medieval period, a small contingent of [[Sikhs]] gave rise to a minuscule but prominent group.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/assamese-sikhs-in-search-of-their-roots/433763/ Assamese Sikhs in search of their roots], ''Indian Express Newspaper, 13 March 2009.''</ref>\n\n===Colonial and post-independence===\nIn the beginning of the [[British Raj|colonial period]] in Assam after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] (1826), the political instability led to the immigration of [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Kuki people]] (Wave 7) into the region across the Patkai and Arakan Yoma. They constitute the [[Singpho people|Singphos]] in Upper Assam, and the Kuki-Chin tribes in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The beginning of tea plantations in Assam (1835) by the British led to the immigration of Mundari speaking people (Wave 8) ([[Munda people|Munda]], [[Santal]], [[Savara people|Savara]], [[Oraon]], [[Gondi people|Gond]] etc. tribes). The British administration in Assam also encouraged immigration of a large influx of service holders and professionals from [[Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Nepal]], etc. (Wave 9). To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal. Some of the tribal groups were able to enter into the Hindu upper caste society while some of them remained in the tribal or lower caste society. Thus, Assam has always been a historically tribal state.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|Sanskritisation and Detribalisation in early Assam|2008|pp=116}}</ref>\n\nAhoms along with [[Chutia people|Chutia]], Moran, Motok, and Koch are still regarded as semi-tribal groups who have nominally converted to Ekasarana Dharma even though keeping alive their own tribal traditions and customs. Various [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] in Assam like Chutiya, [[Rajbongshi people|Koch-Rajbongshi]], Moran, Motok, Ahoms etc (all having tribal origin) have slowly been converted into a caste through [[Sanskritisation]].\n\nAs per latest development indigenous ethnicities like ''Moran'', ''Chutia'', ''Motok'', ''Tai Ahoms'' and ''Koch'' & also non-indigenous<ref>https://www.academia.edu/25822076/Tea_Tribes_of_Assam_Colonial_Exploitation_and_Assertion_of_Adivasi_Rights</ref> ethnic group like the ''Tea tribes'' have realised the above-mentioned points and have applied for ST status .<ref>{{cite news|title=6 Assam tribes may soon get Scheduled Tribes status|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-Assam-tribes-may-soon-get-Scheduled-Tribes-status/articleshow/47335391.cms?from=mdr|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=The Times of India}}</ref> This will make Assam a predominantly tribal state having wider geo-political ramifications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Personalities from Western Assam|People from Western Assam]]\n* [[Assamese people]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |display-authors=1 |last1=Arunkumar |first1=Ganesh Prasad |last2=Wei |first2=Lan-Hai |year=2015 |title=A late Neolithic expansion of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a1\u2010M95 from east to west |url= |journal=Journal of Systematics and Evolution |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=546-560 |doi=10.1111/jse.12147}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Chatterjee|first=Suhas|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KItocaxbibUC&pg=PA443&lpg=PA444|title=Indian Civilization and Culture|date=1998|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal. Some of the tribal groups were able to enter into the Hindu upper caste society while some of them remained in the tribal or lower caste society. Thus, Assam has always been a historically tribal state.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|Sanskritisation and Detribalisation in early Assam|2008|pp=116}}</ref>\n\nAhoms along with [[Chutia people|Chutia]], Moran, Motok, and Koch are still regarded as semi-tribal groups who have nominally converted to Ekasarana Dharma even though keeping alive their own tribal traditions and customs. Various [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] in Assam like Chutiya, [[Rajbongshi people|Koch-Rajbongshi]], Moran, Motok, Ahoms etc (all having tribal origin) have slowly been converted into a caste through [[Sanskritisation]].\n\nAs per latest development indigenous ethnicities like ''Moran'', ''Chutia'', ''Motok'', ''Tai Ahoms'' and ''Koch'' & also non-indigenous<ref>https://www.academia.edu/25822076/Tea_Tribes_of_Assam_Colonial_Exploitation_and_Assertion_of_Adivasi_Rights</ref> ethnic group like the ''Tea tribes'' have realised the above-mentioned points and have applied for ST status .<ref>{{cite news|title=6 Assam tribes may soon get Scheduled Tribes status|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-Assam-tribes-may-soon-get-Scheduled-Tribes-status/articleshow/47335391.cms?from=mdr|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=The Times of India}}</ref> This will make Assam a predominantly tribal state having wider geo-political ramifications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Personalities from Western Assam|People from Western Assam]]\n* [[Assamese people]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |display-authors=1 |last1=Arunkumar |first1=Ganesh Prasad |last2=Wei |first2=Lan-Hai |year=2015 |title=A late Neolithic expansion of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a1\u2010M95 from east to west |url= |journal=Journal of Systematics and Evolution |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=546-560 |doi=10.1111/jse.12147}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Chatterjee|first=Suhas|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KItocaxbibUC&pg=PA443&lpg=PA444|title=Indian Civilization and Culture|date=1998|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.
