It includes [[sovereign state]]s, inhabited [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] and, in some cases, constituent [[country|countries]] of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 3166-1]]. For instance, the [[United Kingdom]] is considered as a single entity, while the constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain [[list of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] not found in ISO 3166-1.\n\nAlso given in percent is each country's population compared with the [[world population]], which the [[United Nations]] estimates at {{#expr: {{worldpop}}/1000000000 round 2}} billion as of today.\n\n==Method==\n{{See also|List of countries and dependencies by population density|List of regional organizations by population}}\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up to date [[Population projection|estimate or projections]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/node/18651512|title=China's Population: The Most Surprising Demographic Crisis|journal=The Economist|year=2013}}</ref> by the national [[census]] authority where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the projections for 2019 by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].<ref name=\"unpop\"/>\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of [[statistics|accuracy]], the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the [[countries of the United Kingdom]], are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities, such as the [[European Union]],{{efn|The European Union is a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[supranational union]] whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states.

She made her first appearance on 11 May 2006 and temporarily left ''EastEnders'' in early 2008 to give birth to her second child. Her exit coincided with the departure of [[Matt Di Angelo]] ([[Dean Wicks]]) and permanent departures of cast members [[Phil Daniels]] ([[Kevin Wicks]]), [[Kellie Shirley]] ([[Carly Wicks]]). She returned to Walford on 6 June 2008. This is Parish's second role in ''EastEnders'', as she previously played singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.\n\nIntroduced as a single mother to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) who has come from an abusive marriage, Denise has gone on to marry two additional times. Firstly, to Kevin in 2007, who dies months later, and then to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) in 2009, with them divorcing two years later after he is imprisoned for murder. She also embarks on a loveless engagement to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), flings with younger men [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and a drunken one-night stand with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) which results in a [[Advanced maternal age|late in life pregnancy]]. Denise's third child, a son, is born in 2017, but she gives him up for adoption, shortly before her mother tells her she is adopted herself (although this was later proved untrue). Other storylines involving Denise include surviving a bus crash, losing her job, descending into poverty and a relationship with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]).\n\n==Storylines==\nMoving to Walford, Denise has a tempestuous encounter with [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]); however, an attraction develops and they begin dating. Denise's former husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), an alcoholic, tries to reunite with their daughter, [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) and he later kidnaps her. He tries to drown himself and Libby but she recovers and Owen is arrested. Denise, who never knew her father but knows he played in a band called \"The Five Hectors\", thinks that [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) may be her father as he was in the band but a DNA test proves that he is not. The band also consisted of [[Aubrey Valentine]] ([[Joseph Marcell]]), [[Cedric Lucas]] ([[Ram John Holder]]), Dwight and Earl. The identity of Denise's father is never discovered, but Aubrey also eliminates himself.\n\nWhen Kevin's former wife, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), arrives in Walford, she causes problems for Denise and Kevin. Shirley reveals Kevin's secret, that he is not [[Dean Wicks|Deano]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and [[Carly Wicks|Carly]]'s ([[Kellie Shirley]]) biological father. After Shirley tells everyone this, Kevin flees. Upset, Denise threatens to move away but stays when Kevin returns and proposes marriage. Shirley unsuccessfully tries to ruin the wedding and Denise deals with various problems, including Chelsea and Dean's imprisonment for framing [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), Kevin's attempts to conceal the crime, and a feud with her boss at the post office, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). Kevin starts selling cars for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), but discovers they are [[Lemon (automobile)|cut-and-shut]]s; he tries to destroy the cars but dies in an accident. Denise and Carly leave Walford after the funeral, seeking the right place to scatter Kevin's ashes.\n\nDenise returns, but is angry to discover her daughter [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) is using drugs and in contact with her father, former drug addict [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Denise is initially hostile but she warms to him when she sees he has changed and they eventually reunite. Denise proposes to Lucas but he is married to [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]). Trina attempts to seduce Lucas but he accidentally kills her. Denise helps Jordan come to terms with his mother's death, with them believing it to be an overdose. With Trina dead, Denise and Lucas are able to marry, though further complications arise when Owen is released from prison. He desperately tries to show Denise that she cannot trust Lucas but they marry regardless. Lucas kills Owen on their wedding day and his body is discovered eight months later. Lucas confesses to Denise, claiming self-defence. At first, she agrees to protect him but convinces him to go to the police. However, he instead drives her to a canal. When she refuses to submit to God, he strangles her. He murders a prostitute, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Gemma|Gemma]] (Rita Balogun), and identifies her as Denise, her family believing she committed suicide. Lucas keeps Denise prisoner in the house next door but she escapes after a few weeks and Lucas is arrested, later sentenced to life imprisonment. Chelsea, needing a fresh start, moves to Spain with Owen's mother, [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]) and Libby joins them for a holiday before returning to university. Denise is heartbroken to see her girls leave but is distracted by her sister, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]), arriving and saying that she has left her boyfriend, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), and asks to move in with them.\n\nKim and Denise later buy the house next door and open a [[bed and breakfast]]. Denise talks to Zainab, who helps her move on by destroying memories of Lucas. Denise starts dating [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), Zainab's former husband, but ends it after realising he is still in love with Zainab. On Christmas Day 2011, Denise opens a present containing a broken toy car and a USB stick with a recording of Phil talking about his part in Kevin's death. Horrified, Denise calls Phil a murderer and tries to get him arrested but fails to do so.\n\nYusef starts a fire at the bed and breakfast, damaging it so badly that Denise, Kim and Patrick are forced to move out. The insurance company refuse to pay out as it was arson so Patrick gives Denise and Kim the Minute Mart but Zainab gives them Yusef's money so they can rebuild the bed and breakfast. When the B&B opens, Denise is angry that Kim simply flirts with the customers, leaving all the work to her. They have an argument and Denise quits but returns on the condition that Kim puts in more effort. When Zainab's brother-in-law. [[AJ Ahmed]] ([[Phaldut Sharma]]), arrives in Walford, he attempts to con Denise but fails. The two later have drinks but AJ leaves. Denise attends [[Christian Clarke]]'s ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) stag party where a man gives her unwanted attention. She has sex with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) when he defends her from an overly-persistent interest and allows him to walk her home. The next day, Denise is embarrassed and tells Fatboy it was a mistake. However, it is revealed she has feelings for Fatboy and after she welcomes him into her home, they have sex again. Denise agrees to pursue a secret relationship with Fatboy. When Fatboy tries to encourage her to make their relationship public, Denise calls it off, telling Fatboy she will treasure the memory of their time together. After a lonely Christmas, Kim and Zainab decide to set up a date for her. However, this fails and when Kim's boyfriend [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) comforts her, they share a kiss. Ray tells Kim about it but says Denise made the first move, so Kim slaps Denise and says she is dead to her. Denise and Kim reconcile until Ray ends his relationship with Kim. Kim blames Denise so Denise stays with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). When Ray tells Kim the truth, Denise and Kim reconcile and Denise moves back in with Kim.\n\nWhen Denise and Ian get locked in the Minute Mart's storage cupboard and share a kiss, it leads to a relationship. This becomes public, thanks to Ian's daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Denise helps Ian open a restaurant and supports him when [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) threatens and blackmails him. Denise moves in with Ian and his children and are joined by [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]), daughter of Ian's dead former wife. Denise begins to feel part of the family and supports Ian when he intends to testify that he saw [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. However, Ian fails to do this and Denise is devastated to learn that Ian was intending to lie to frame Max on Carl's orders. The return of Ian's former wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), causes Denise to have doubts about their relationship. She accepts Ian's marriage proposal and during their engagement party, she shares a kiss with Fatboy. They come to their senses when they are caught by [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). Fatboy's girlfriend, [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), learns of the kiss and posts a letter to Ian, before leaving Walford but Lucy reads it and challenges Denise. For the sake of her father's mental health, Lucy agrees to keep it a secret. Denise and Ian drift apart due to his busy lifestyle. After visiting Libby in Oxford, she plans to leave Ian. However, when Lucy is murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), Denise feels forced to stay and support him. Denise is sidelined by Ian and decides to leave, confiding in Patrick that she feels trapped. However, worried that she will look like a bad person, Denise changes her mind and returns but still feels ostracised. She does not attend Lucy's funeral after seeing Ian and Jane comforting one another. Under advice from Libby, Denise tells Ian she can no longer be with him but he begs her to stay. Denise agrees to stay when Ian admits he has taken her for granted and encourages her to go with Libby to Spain to celebrate Chelsea's birthday.\n\nOn Denise's return, things are much better between her and Ian and he arranges for them to visit Libby in Oxford for a weekend. As she is about to leave, Patrick tries to stop her, but fails and leaves a message, asking her to call him as soon as possible. However, she learns that Patrick has had a stroke and they return to Walford. When he leaves hospital, he stays with Ian and Denise. Denise learns that Ian had sex with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) on the night Lucy died. Feeling betrayed, Denise locks herself in the Minute Mart. On returning home, she discovers that Cindy has returned and that Ian has delivered her newborn daughter, Beth. She tells Ian that she forgives him but leaves him the next day, taking Patrick back to live in his own house, declaring that Ian isn't the man she loved. Going into Patrick's house, Denise is devastated to find that the house has been broken into. Denise struggles to care for Patrick alone, despite support from [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). She finds that Denise has been stealing alcohol from the shop but does not report it if Denise returns the value. Patrick is devastated to learn that he may lose his allotment so Denise goes there, intending to maintain it, only to dig up Lucy's phone and purse. Although hesitant, she returns them to the Beales.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, a pregnant Kim surprises Denise and accuses Ian of ruining Denise's life. The next day, Kim finds bruises on Patrick's arms and realises Denise had beaten him and confronts her. At the pub, Denise gets drunk, and after hearing of [[Emma Summerhayes]]' ([[Anna Acton]]) death, drunkenly slurs that Lucy's killer would be jailed if Emma had done her job properly. In anger of Denise's disrespectfulness, Ian says that despite what Kim said, Denise has been ruining her own life. On arriving home, she tells Kim she cannot be Patrick's carer any more. After an argument with Denise in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Kim goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter named [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. Although she disowns Denise, they eventually reconcile the next day. After Pearl's christening, she tells Denise that her husband doesn't exist and she made him up because of fear of being alone. However, Kim's confessions to Shirley, [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) and Patrick reveal that her husband does exist but she left him when she found out that he was a criminal. Eventually, when her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) tracks her down in Walford, Kim works up the courage to tell Denise the truth about him and explains her experience when she went to tell him she was pregnant. Denise and Patrick soon become wary of Vincent's intentions.\n\nDenise is visited by the police, saying someone in their custody has given her address as theirs. Eventually she realises that it is Jordan (now played by [[Joivan Wade]]). She discovers that Jordan stole from Chelsea and Libby advises Denise to stay away from him. Denise visits Lucas in prison and he tells her that he thinks about her, asking her to find Jordan. Despite her family begging her not to, Denise sends Jordan a message online. He does not reply but visits and tells her to leave him alone. However, when Kim hits Jordan, he allows Denise to clean the wound. Jordan is received badly by the rest of the family but Denise defends him after he pushes her in frustration, he leaves when Patrick says he is just like Lucas. The police visit Denise and tell her that Jordan was attacked by a gang but discharged himself from hospital. She tracks him down and learns that Jordan's girlfriend died from a drug overdose. Denise brings Jordan and his son, [[JJ Johnson (EastEnders)|JJ Johnson]] (Zayden Kareem), home and although Patrick comes around to the idea, Kim believes it will bring Lucas back into Denise's life. Denise visits Lucas again and he wants Jordan to visit too. He does and Denise agrees to help Lucas get a job in the prison kitchens, but Lucas asks Jordan to help him in his plan for him to escape from prison. When Jordan tells Denise, she refuses to help and alerts Libby to call the police, after which Jordan reveals to them the truth about Lucas' plan before he is arrested. Denise vows to look after JJ until Jordan is released but Patrick secretly calls social services.<ref name=\"10mar16b\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/03/2016 (part 2)|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073c5pj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Writer: Jaden Clark |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 10 March 2016}}</ref> Denise is told by social worker [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hilary Taylor|Hilary Taylor]] (Sadie Shimmin) that JJ's mother, Amelle, is alive.<ref name=\"31mar16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 31/03/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075vwvg |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Michael Owen Morris; Writer: Carey Andrews |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 31 March 2016}}</ref> Amelle visits Denise and JJ, but he refuses to come out from under the table.

Denise tells Carmel that she has decided to have the baby and put it up for adoption. Kim finds out about Denise's plans and tries to talk her out of it whilst Patrick agrees to support her. Kim tells Denise that she and Vincent will adopt her baby, but Denise declines their offer. Shirley suspects that her former boyfriend, [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), is the father but Denise admits that Phil is the father. Unbeknownst to Denise and Shirley, Phil's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), overhears this. Denise is later taken to hospital to be induced. Kim and their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), also go to the hospital. Kim and Emerald are angry when they learn that Denise is putting her son up for adoption but Denise refuses to change her mind and says an emotional farewell to her son alone. Sharon tells Phil the truth about his son and he goes to the hospital, demanding to see him but then agrees to the adoption. Libby, Emerald and Carmel come to accept Denise's decision but Kim is against it, calling her selfish and saying Denise is dead to her. Denise is injured in a bus crash, but rejects Kim when she tries to support her.

Emerald then leaves and Kim and Denise hug. Denise confronts schoolboy [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]) after he vandalises the garden in the square. After continuously insulting Denise, she hits him in the face. Using witnesses to his advantage, Keegan reports Denise to the police and she is consequently fined \u00a3250.\n\nDenise later learns that her son's potential adoptive parents have named him Raymond and she signs the adoption forms. While she is adamant that she will not change her mind after that, she continues to struggle with her decision and angrily tears up a newly arrived letter from Raymond's adoptive parents without reading it. Kim then wrongly believes that Ian is Raymond's biological father and confronts him, causing Denise to break down and admit to her that Phil is the father, shocking Kim, and she begs Kim not to tell anyone. With Kim's help, Denise finds the letter from Raymond's parents in the recycling bin, informing her that he is happy with them, which comforts and reassures her. Denise and Kush start a relationship, but when Denise talks to a reporter, criticising the community and the Minute Mart, she quits her job after they decide to send her on a course. Denise struggles financially and is unable to buy food, taking food from bins. She ends her relationship with Kush because she does not want to admit her problems. Carmel later confronts her over this, but Denise slaps her when she makes a remark about Raymond, ending their friendship. Denise eventually claims for [[Universal Credit]], but is stunned that she will not receive money for ten weeks as she left her job voluntarily, but is given a referral to a food bank. Denise leaves the food bank when she sees Cora, who works there. Cora persuades Denise to get some food and explains that when she first used the food bank, she was abusive, but it saved her life. Denise gives her food to the children of a young mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Candice|Candice]] (Maia Watkins), who has no voucher. On the day of her final exam, Denise faints, but she is delighted later in the year when she passes her GCSE exam with high marks. Kush and Denise decide to try dating again, but when Kush asks Denise to move in with him, she declines, feeling that things are moving too fast for them. When Kush suffers a heart attack shortly afterwards, Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Denise discovers that Kim is pregnant, but Kim suffers a miscarriage and continues to lie that about her \"pregnancy\". Kim later cracks up and tells Denise and Carmel that she is not pregnant and is lying and they support her. For her birthday, Kim asks Denise to do a DNA test and she agrees. When the results come, Denise finds a card for her by Kim, which says they are not sisters, but Kim explains she has not seen the results and got cards for both outcomes. Denise and Kim agree not to find out, but Kim gives in and fools Denise that the results say they are not sisters, but is delighted when Kim says they are.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nOn 7 November 2005, the BBC announced that [[Diane Parish]] had been cast in ''EastEnders'' as a \"sassy, strong\" character with links to the established Wicks family, who would be \"a force to be reckoned with.\"<ref name=\"PR\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/07/eastenders.shtml |title=Kellie Shirley and Diane Parish to join EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Parish had previously appeared in the serial as singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.<ref name=\"PR\"/> In January 2006, Parish's character was revealed to be Denise Fox, who would embark on a romance with fellow newcomer [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]).

She made her first appearance on 11 May 2006 and temporarily left ''EastEnders'' in early 2008 to give birth to her second child. Her exit coincided with the departure of [[Matt Di Angelo]] ([[Dean Wicks]]) and permanent departures of cast members [[Phil Daniels]] ([[Kevin Wicks]]), [[Kellie Shirley]] ([[Carly Wicks]]). She returned to Walford on 6 June 2008. This is Parish's second role in ''EastEnders'', as she previously played singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.\n\nIntroduced as a single mother to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) who has come from an abusive marriage, Denise has gone on to marry two additional times. Firstly, to Kevin in 2007, who dies months later, and then to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) in 2009, with them divorcing two years later after he is imprisoned for murder. She also embarks on a loveless engagement to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), flings with younger men [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and a drunken one-night stand with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) which results in a [[Advanced maternal age|late in life pregnancy]]. Denise's third child, a son, is born in 2017, but she gives him up for adoption, shortly before her mother tells her she is adopted herself (although this was later proved untrue). Other storylines involving Denise include surviving a bus crash, losing her job, descending into poverty and a relationship with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]).\n\n==Storylines==\nMoving to Walford, Denise has a tempestuous encounter with [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]); however, an attraction develops and they begin dating. Denise's former husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), an alcoholic, tries to reunite with their daughter, [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) and he later kidnaps her. He tries to drown himself and Libby but she recovers and Owen is arrested. Denise, who never knew her father but knows he played in a band called \"The Five Hectors\", thinks that [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) may be her father as he was in the band but a DNA test proves that he is not. The band also consisted of [[Aubrey Valentine]] ([[Joseph Marcell]]), [[Cedric Lucas]] ([[Ram John Holder]]), Dwight and Earl. The identity of Denise's father is never discovered, but Aubrey also eliminates himself.\n\nWhen Kevin's former wife, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), arrives in Walford, she causes problems for Denise and Kevin. Shirley reveals Kevin's secret, that he is not [[Dean Wicks|Deano]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and [[Carly Wicks|Carly]]'s ([[Kellie Shirley]]) biological father. After Shirley tells everyone this, Kevin flees. Upset, Denise threatens to move away but stays when Kevin returns and proposes marriage. Shirley unsuccessfully tries to ruin the wedding and Denise deals with various problems, including Chelsea and Dean's imprisonment for framing [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), Kevin's attempts to conceal the crime, and a feud with her boss at the post office, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). Kevin starts selling cars for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), but discovers they are [[Lemon (automobile)|cut-and-shut]]s; he tries to destroy the cars but dies in an accident. Denise and Carly leave Walford after the funeral, seeking the right place to scatter Kevin's ashes.\n\nDenise returns, but is angry to discover her daughter [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) is using drugs and in contact with her father, former drug addict [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Denise is initially hostile but she warms to him when she sees he has changed and they eventually reunite. Denise proposes to Lucas but he is married to [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]). Trina attempts to seduce Lucas but he accidentally kills her. Denise helps Jordan come to terms with his mother's death, with them believing it to be an overdose. With Trina dead, Denise and Lucas are able to marry, though further complications arise when Owen is released from prison. He desperately tries to show Denise that she cannot trust Lucas but they marry regardless. Lucas kills Owen on their wedding day and his body is discovered eight months later. Lucas confesses to Denise, claiming self-defence. At first, she agrees to protect him but convinces him to go to the police. However, he instead drives her to a canal. When she refuses to submit to God, he strangles her. He murders a prostitute, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Gemma|Gemma]] (Rita Balogun), and identifies her as Denise, her family believing she committed suicide. Lucas keeps Denise prisoner in the house next door but she escapes after a few weeks and Lucas is arrested, later sentenced to life imprisonment. Chelsea, needing a fresh start, moves to Spain with Owen's mother, [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]) and Libby joins them for a holiday before returning to university. Denise is heartbroken to see her girls leave but is distracted by her sister, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]), arriving and saying that she has left her boyfriend, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), and asks to move in with them.\n\nKim and Denise later buy the house next door and open a [[bed and breakfast]]. Denise talks to Zainab, who helps her move on by destroying memories of Lucas. Denise starts dating [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), Zainab's former husband, but ends it after realising he is still in love with Zainab. On Christmas Day 2011, Denise opens a present containing a broken toy car and a USB stick with a recording of Phil talking about his part in Kevin's death. Horrified, Denise calls Phil a murderer and tries to get him arrested but fails to do so.\n\nYusef starts a fire at the bed and breakfast, damaging it so badly that Denise, Kim and Patrick are forced to move out. The insurance company refuse to pay out as it was arson so Patrick gives Denise and Kim the Minute Mart but Zainab gives them Yusef's money so they can rebuild the bed and breakfast. When the B&B opens, Denise is angry that Kim simply flirts with the customers, leaving all the work to her. They have an argument and Denise quits but returns on the condition that Kim puts in more effort. When Zainab's brother-in-law. [[AJ Ahmed]] ([[Phaldut Sharma]]), arrives in Walford, he attempts to con Denise but fails. The two later have drinks but AJ leaves. Denise attends [[Christian Clarke]]'s ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) stag party where a man gives her unwanted attention. She has sex with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) when he defends her from an overly-persistent interest and allows him to walk her home. The next day, Denise is embarrassed and tells Fatboy it was a mistake. However, it is revealed she has feelings for Fatboy and after she welcomes him into her home, they have sex again. Denise agrees to pursue a secret relationship with Fatboy. When Fatboy tries to encourage her to make their relationship public, Denise calls it off, telling Fatboy she will treasure the memory of their time together. After a lonely Christmas, Kim and Zainab decide to set up a date for her. However, this fails and when Kim's boyfriend [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) comforts her, they share a kiss. Ray tells Kim about it but says Denise made the first move, so Kim slaps Denise and says she is dead to her. Denise and Kim reconcile until Ray ends his relationship with Kim. Kim blames Denise so Denise stays with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). When Ray tells Kim the truth, Denise and Kim reconcile and Denise moves back in with Kim.\n\nWhen Denise and Ian get locked in the Minute Mart's storage cupboard and share a kiss, it leads to a relationship. This becomes public, thanks to Ian's daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Denise helps Ian open a restaurant and supports him when [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) threatens and blackmails him. Denise moves in with Ian and his children and are joined by [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]), daughter of Ian's dead former wife. Denise begins to feel part of the family and supports Ian when he intends to testify that he saw [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. However, Ian fails to do this and Denise is devastated to learn that Ian was intending to lie to frame Max on Carl's orders. The return of Ian's former wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), causes Denise to have doubts about their relationship. She accepts Ian's marriage proposal and during their engagement party, she shares a kiss with Fatboy. They come to their senses when they are caught by [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). Fatboy's girlfriend, [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), learns of the kiss and posts a letter to Ian, before leaving Walford but Lucy reads it and challenges Denise. For the sake of her father's mental health, Lucy agrees to keep it a secret. Denise and Ian drift apart due to his busy lifestyle. After visiting Libby in Oxford, she plans to leave Ian. However, when Lucy is murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), Denise feels forced to stay and support him. Denise is sidelined by Ian and decides to leave, confiding in Patrick that she feels trapped. However, worried that she will look like a bad person, Denise changes her mind and returns but still feels ostracised. She does not attend Lucy's funeral after seeing Ian and Jane comforting one another. Under advice from Libby, Denise tells Ian she can no longer be with him but he begs her to stay. Denise agrees to stay when Ian admits he has taken her for granted and encourages her to go with Libby to Spain to celebrate Chelsea's birthday.\n\nOn Denise's return, things are much better between her and Ian and he arranges for them to visit Libby in Oxford for a weekend. As she is about to leave, Patrick tries to stop her, but fails and leaves a message, asking her to call him as soon as possible. However, she learns that Patrick has had a stroke and they return to Walford. When he leaves hospital, he stays with Ian and Denise. Denise learns that Ian had sex with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) on the night Lucy died. Feeling betrayed, Denise locks herself in the Minute Mart. On returning home, she discovers that Cindy has returned and that Ian has delivered her newborn daughter, Beth. She tells Ian that she forgives him but leaves him the next day, taking Patrick back to live in his own house, declaring that Ian isn't the man she loved. Going into Patrick's house, Denise is devastated to find that the house has been broken into. Denise struggles to care for Patrick alone, despite support from [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). She finds that Denise has been stealing alcohol from the shop but does not report it if Denise returns the value. Patrick is devastated to learn that he may lose his allotment so Denise goes there, intending to maintain it, only to dig up Lucy's phone and purse. Although hesitant, she returns them to the Beales.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, a pregnant Kim surprises Denise and accuses Ian of ruining Denise's life. The next day, Kim finds bruises on Patrick's arms and realises Denise had beaten him and confronts her. At the pub, Denise gets drunk, and after hearing of [[Emma Summerhayes]]' ([[Anna Acton]]) death, drunkenly slurs that Lucy's killer would be jailed if Emma had done her job properly. In anger of Denise's disrespectfulness, Ian says that despite what Kim said, Denise has been ruining her own life. On arriving home, she tells Kim she cannot be Patrick's carer any more. After an argument with Denise in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Kim goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter named [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. Although she disowns Denise, they eventually reconcile the next day. After Pearl's christening, she tells Denise that her husband doesn't exist and she made him up because of fear of being alone. However, Kim's confessions to Shirley, [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) and Patrick reveal that her husband does exist but she left him when she found out that he was a criminal. Eventually, when her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) tracks her down in Walford, Kim works up the courage to tell Denise the truth about him and explains her experience when she went to tell him she was pregnant. Denise and Patrick soon become wary of Vincent's intentions.\n\nDenise is visited by the police, saying someone in their custody has given her address as theirs. Eventually she realises that it is Jordan (now played by [[Joivan Wade]]). She discovers that Jordan stole from Chelsea and Libby advises Denise to stay away from him. Denise visits Lucas in prison and he tells her that he thinks about her, asking her to find Jordan. Despite her family begging her not to, Denise sends Jordan a message online. He does not reply but visits and tells her to leave him alone. However, when Kim hits Jordan, he allows Denise to clean the wound. Jordan is received badly by the rest of the family but Denise defends him after he pushes her in frustration, he leaves when Patrick says he is just like Lucas. The police visit Denise and tell her that Jordan was attacked by a gang but discharged himself from hospital. She tracks him down and learns that Jordan's girlfriend died from a drug overdose. Denise brings Jordan and his son, [[JJ Johnson (EastEnders)|JJ Johnson]] (Zayden Kareem), home and although Patrick comes around to the idea, Kim believes it will bring Lucas back into Denise's life. Denise visits Lucas again and he wants Jordan to visit too. He does and Denise agrees to help Lucas get a job in the prison kitchens, but Lucas asks Jordan to help him in his plan for him to escape from prison. When Jordan tells Denise, she refuses to help and alerts Libby to call the police, after which Jordan reveals to them the truth about Lucas' plan before he is arrested. Denise vows to look after JJ until Jordan is released but Patrick secretly calls social services.<ref name=\"10mar16b\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/03/2016 (part 2)|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073c5pj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Writer: Jaden Clark |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 10 March 2016}}</ref> Denise is told by social worker [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hilary Taylor|Hilary Taylor]] (Sadie Shimmin) that JJ's mother, Amelle, is alive.<ref name=\"31mar16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 31/03/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075vwvg |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Michael Owen Morris; Writer: Carey Andrews |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 31 March 2016}}</ref> Amelle visits Denise and JJ, but he refuses to come out from under the table.

Denise tells Carmel that she has decided to have the baby and put it up for adoption. Kim finds out about Denise's plans and tries to talk her out of it whilst Patrick agrees to support her. Kim tells Denise that she and Vincent will adopt her baby, but Denise declines their offer. Shirley suspects that her former boyfriend, [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), is the father but Denise admits that Phil is the father. Unbeknownst to Denise and Shirley, Phil's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), overhears this. Denise is later taken to hospital to be induced. Kim and their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), also go to the hospital. Kim and Emerald are angry when they learn that Denise is putting her son up for adoption but Denise refuses to change her mind and says an emotional farewell to her son alone. Sharon tells Phil the truth about his son and he goes to the hospital, demanding to see him but then agrees to the adoption. Libby, Emerald and Carmel come to accept Denise's decision but Kim is against it, calling her selfish and saying Denise is dead to her.

After a check up at the hospital, Denise admits to [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) that Kim was right and that she should never have given up her son for adoption, though he reassures her that it is the best decision she has made for him.<ref name=\"26jan17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 26/01/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08cbhfj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Toby Frow, Richard Lynn; Writer: Matt Evans |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 26 January 2017 }}</ref> Denise soon realises that Kim still sees her as a mother figure since Emerald abandoned them as children and thinks that if Denise can give up her son, then she can abandon Kim, so Denise tells to consider herself abandoned.<ref name=\"2feb17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 02/02/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08d6np0 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Rick Platt; Writer: Jesse O'Mahoney |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 2 February 2017 }}</ref> Denise later goes to Emerald's farewell party where Emerald criticises Kim's parenting; Denise stands up for Kim and Kim admits that she is thankful for her sister, to which Emerald replies that they are not sisters and that Denise was brought to her as a baby. Emerald then leaves and Kim and Denise hug. Denise confronts schoolboy [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]) after he vandalises the garden in the square. After continuously insulting Denise, she hits him in the face. Using witnesses to his advantage, Keegan reports Denise to the police and she is consequently fined \u00a3250.\n\nDenise later learns that her son's potential adoptive parents have named him Raymond and she signs the adoption forms. While she is adamant that she will not change her mind after that, she continues to struggle with her decision and angrily tears up a newly arrived letter from Raymond's adoptive parents without reading it. Kim then wrongly believes that Ian is Raymond's biological father and confronts him, causing Denise to break down and admit to her that Phil is the father, shocking Kim, and she begs Kim not to tell anyone. With Kim's help, Denise finds the letter from Raymond's parents in the recycling bin, informing her that he is happy with them, which comforts and reassures her. Denise and Kush start a relationship, but when Denise talks to a reporter, criticising the community and the Minute Mart, she quits her job after they decide to send her on a course. Denise struggles financially and is unable to buy food, taking food from bins. She ends her relationship with Kush because she does not want to admit her problems. Carmel later confronts her over this, but Denise slaps her when she makes a remark about Raymond, ending their friendship. Denise eventually claims for [[Universal Credit]], but is stunned that she will not receive money for ten weeks as she left her job voluntarily, but is given a referral to a food bank. Denise leaves the food bank when she sees Cora, who works there. Cora persuades Denise to get some food and explains that when she first used the food bank, she was abusive, but it saved her life. Denise gives her food to the children of a young mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Candice|Candice]] (Maia Watkins), who has no voucher. On the day of her final exam, Denise faints, but she is delighted later in the year when she passes her GCSE exam with high marks. Kush and Denise decide to try dating again, but when Kush asks Denise to move in with him, she declines, feeling that things are moving too fast for them. When Kush suffers a heart attack shortly afterwards, Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Denise discovers that Kim is pregnant, but Kim suffers a miscarriage and continues to lie that about her \"pregnancy\". Kim later cracks up and tells Denise and Carmel that she is not pregnant and is lying and they support her. For her birthday, Kim asks Denise to do a DNA test and she agrees. When the results come, Denise finds a card for her by Kim, which says they are not sisters, but Kim explains she has not seen the results and got cards for both outcomes. Denise and Kim agree not to find out, but Kim gives in and fools Denise that the results say they are not sisters, but is delighted when Kim says they are.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nOn 7 November 2005, the BBC announced that [[Diane Parish]] had been cast in ''EastEnders'' as a \"sassy, strong\" character with links to the established Wicks family, who would be \"a force to be reckoned with.\"<ref name=\"PR\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/07/eastenders.shtml |title=Kellie Shirley and Diane Parish to join EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Parish had previously appeared in the serial as singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.<ref name=\"PR\"/> In January 2006, Parish's character was revealed to be Denise Fox, who would embark on a romance with fellow newcomer [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]).

MBBS is the basic medical course at bachelor's degree level. This is followed by master's degree level specialisation in general surgery, general internal medicine, pediatrics and other fields. Superspecialties are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduation, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, neurology, and pediatric neurology. There are at least 45 superspecialties at AIIMS (New Delhi) at higher master's degree level. AIIMS also offers M.Sc. and PhD level research courses.\n\nThere are about forty-two specialty post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS (New Delhi). The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination, AIIMS PG, held every six months.<ref name=\"dunia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careerconvey.com/exam/aiims|title=All India Institute Of Medical Sciences - AIIMS-EXAM|website=Careerconvey|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates and 25 thousand dental graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately <1% of the candidates are admitted through the process.\n\nInstitute has a separate Examination-Section of its own, dedicated for all national level entrance exams, university's internal professional exams and departmental exams.

And that was something really crucial for the main objectives for which AIIMS (New Delhi) was established, which are cutting edge research, medical innovations and to demonstrate high standards of medical education to all medical colleges and allied institutions in India.\n\n===Residential facilities===\nAIIMS is a residential university where the faculty members, staff, and students live on either the main campus or one of the several extension campuses.

MBBS is the basic medical course at bachelor's degree level. This is followed by master's degree level specialisation in general surgery, general internal medicine, pediatrics and other fields. Superspecialties are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduation, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, neurology, and pediatric neurology. There are at least 45 superspecialties at AIIMS (New Delhi) at higher master's degree level. AIIMS also offers M.Sc. and PhD level research courses.\n\nThere are about forty-two specialty post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS (New Delhi). The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination, AIIMS PG, held every six months.<ref name=\"dunia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careerconvey.com/exam/aiims|title=All India Institute Of Medical Sciences - AIIMS-EXAM|website=Careerconvey|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates and 25 thousand dental graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately <1% of the candidates are admitted through the process.\n\nInstitute has a separate Examination-Section of its own, dedicated for all national level entrance exams, university's internal professional exams and departmental exams.

Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]]. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}\n\nThe name \"Falkland Islands\" comes from [[Falkland Sound]], the [[strait]] that separates the two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name \"Falkland\" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690.

The principal islands are at closest {{convert|243.5|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, and about {{convert|752|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Cape Dubouzet|northern tip]] of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of {{convert|4700|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have internal [[self-governance]], and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.\n\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted its rule in 1833]], but Argentina maintains its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim to the islands]]. In April 1982, Argentine military forces [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the islands]]. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the [[Falklands War]]. Almost all Falklanders [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum|favour]] the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory.

Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]]. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}\n\nThe name \"Falkland Islands\" comes from [[Falkland Sound]], the [[strait]] that separates the two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name \"Falkland\" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]] who sponsored his journey.<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Dotan|2010|p = 165}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The Viscount's title originates from the town of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], Scotland\u2014the town's name likely comes from a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] term referring to an \"enclosure\" (''lann''),{{efn-ua|According to researcher Simon Taylor, the exact Gaelic etymology is unclear as the \"falk\" in the name could have stood for \"hidden\" (''falach''), \"wash\" (''failc''), or \"heavy rain\" (''falc'').{{sfn|Taylor|M\u00e1rkus|2005|p=158}}}} but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo-Saxon term \"folkland\" (land held by [[Anglo-Saxon law#Folk-right and privilege|folk-right]]).{{sfn|Room|2006|p = 129}} The name \"Falklands\" was not applied to the islands until 1765, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] captain [[John Byron]] of the [[Royal Navy]], claimed them for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as \"Falkland's Islands\".<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Paine|2000|p = 45}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The term \"Falklands\" is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.\n\nThe Spanish name for the archipelago, ''Islas Malvinas'', derives from the French ''\u00celes Malouines''\u2014the name given to the islands by [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] in 1764.{{sfn|Hince|2001|p = 121}} Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of [[Saint-Malo]] (the point of departure for his ships and colonists).<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Hince|2001|p = 121}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The port, located in the [[Brittany]] region of western France, was named after [[Malo (saint)|St. Malo]] (or Maclou), the Christian [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the city.{{sfn|Balmaceda|2011|loc = Chapter 36}}\n\nAt the twentieth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[United Nations Fourth Committee|Fourth Committee]] determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''. In Spanish, the territory was designated as ''Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands)''.{{sfn|Foreign Office|1961|p = 80}} The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''.<ref name=\"std_name\">{{cite web | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm | title= Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications | publisher=United Nations Statistics Division | date=13 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Falkland Islands|Timeline of the history of the Falkland Islands}}\n\nAlthough [[Fuegians]] from [[Patagonia]] may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times,<ref>{{cite journal |author=G.

Common between meals are \"home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee\".{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|pp = 63\u201364}} Social activities are, according to Wagstaff, \"typical of that of a small British

It has 14 members of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] and four [[Members of the European Parliament]]. It was the junior partner in a coalition with [[Civic Platform]]. It is a member of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party group]] in the European Parliament.\n\nThe party was formed in 1990 as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party. The PSL formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) after winning 132 seats in the Sejm at the [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 election]], with PSL leader [[Waldemar Pawlak]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] until 1995. The party fell to 27 at the [[1997 Polish parliamentary election|next election]], and moved towards the centre at the end of the 1990s. [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|In 2001]], the party re-entered a coalition with the SLD, but withdrew in 2003. After the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 election]], the PSL entered a coalition with the [[centrist]] [[Liberalism in Poland|liberal]] [[Civic Platform]] (PO).\n\nThe party's name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]], which sent MPs to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament in Vienna]]. Until the 2014 [[2014 Polish local elections|local election]], the PSL formed self-government coalition in fifteen to sixteen [[Voivodeship sejmik|regional assemblies]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1945===\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of [[Rzeszow]] under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe (People's Party). The party changed its name in 1903 to what it's known as now. The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful, seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century. In the [[Second Polish Republic]] there were a few parties named PSL ([[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Left\"]] and others) until they were removed by the [[Sanacja]] regime (see also [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]]).\n\nDuring this time there were two parties using the term \"Polish People's Party\": [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] (which were merged into [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] with [[Stronnictwo Ch\u0142opskie]]). During [[World War II]], PSL took part in forming the [[Polish government in exile]].\n\n===Under the communist regime===\n[[File:PSL w Powiatach Barry Kent.png|right|thumb|250px|Support for the PSL by region]]\nAfter the war, [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]], a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, returned to communist-dominated Poland, where he joined the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|provisional government]] and [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|rebuilt PSL]]. The party hoped to win the [[Yalta Conference]]-mandated elections and help establish a [[parliamentary system]] in Poland. The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them. The [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary election]] was heavily rigged, with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote. Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly.\n\nMiko\u0142ajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life. The communists then forced the remains of Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL to unite with the pro-communist People's Party to form the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. The ZSL was a governing partner in the [[Front of National Unity|ruling coalition]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34-36\">[[David Ost]], ''Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics'', pp. 34-36, 1990 Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]], {{ISBN|0-87722-655-5}}</ref>\n\n===After the fall of the regime===\nAround the time of the [[fall of communism]] several PSLs were recreated, including: [[Polish People's Party\u2013Peasants' Agreement|Porozumienie Ludowe]], Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe - Odrodzenie, and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (Wilan\u00f3w faction). In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] grouping, and in 1990 changed its name to PSL.\n\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s, entering into coalitions with the postcommunist [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. However, in the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary elections]] PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, an alliance which later broke down. Since then PSL has moved towards more [[centrism|centrist]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] policies.\n\n===After 2004===\nThe party ran in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Poland|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and received 6% of the vote, giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]] the party received 7% of votes, giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate. In the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] the party placed fourth, with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats, and entered into a governing coalition with the victor, the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right conservative]] [[Civic Platform]] (''Platforma Obywatelska'').\n\n===Current situation===\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009.\n\nIn [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 national parliamentary election]] Polish People's Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate.<ref name=\"pkw-results2011\">{{cite web|url=http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|title=Elections 2011 - Election results|publisher=National Electoral Commission|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075746/http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|archivedate=14 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote, just barely over the 5 percent threshold.

The party advocates [[economic protectionism]] by the state  (especially in agriculture), and \"slower [[privatization]]\" (although it is not against privatization). On social and ethical issues, PSL opposes abortion, same-sex marriage, soft drug decriminalization, euthanasia and death penalty. It also supports mandatory [[State school|public (state) education]] and [[publicly funded health care]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Support===\nParty traditionally representing farmers, peasants and rural voters generally.

The party has less support in larger cities and mining areas of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

It has 14 members of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] and four [[Members of the European Parliament]]. It was the junior partner in a coalition with [[Civic Platform]]. It is a member of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party group]] in the European Parliament.\n\nThe party was formed in 1990 as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party. The PSL formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) after winning 132 seats in the Sejm at the [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 election]], with PSL leader [[Waldemar Pawlak]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] until 1995. The party fell to 27 at the [[1997 Polish parliamentary election|next election]], and moved towards the centre at the end of the 1990s. [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|In 2001]], the party re-entered a coalition with the SLD, but withdrew in 2003. After the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 election]], the PSL entered a coalition with the [[centrist]] [[Liberalism in Poland|liberal]] [[Civic Platform]] (PO).\n\nThe party's name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]], which sent MPs to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament in Vienna]]. Until the 2014 [[2014 Polish local elections|local election]], the PSL formed self-government coalition in fifteen to sixteen [[Voivodeship sejmik|regional assemblies]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1945===\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of [[Rzeszow]] under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe (People's Party). The party changed its name in 1903 to what it's known as now. The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful, seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century. In the [[Second Polish Republic]] there were a few parties named PSL ([[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Left\"]] and others) until they were removed by the [[Sanacja]] regime (see also [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]]).\n\nDuring this time there were two parties using the term \"Polish People's Party\": [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] (which were merged into [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] with [[Stronnictwo Ch\u0142opskie]]). During [[World War II]], PSL took part in forming the [[Polish government in exile]].\n\n===Under the communist regime===\n[[File:PSL w Powiatach Barry Kent.png|right|thumb|250px|Support for the PSL by region]]\nAfter the war, [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]], a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, returned to communist-dominated Poland, where he joined the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|provisional government]] and [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|rebuilt PSL]]. The party hoped to win the [[Yalta Conference]]-mandated elections and help establish a [[parliamentary system]] in Poland. The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them. The [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary election]] was heavily rigged, with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote. Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly.\n\nMiko\u0142ajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life. The communists then forced the remains of Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL to unite with the pro-communist People's Party to form the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. The ZSL was a governing partner in the [[Front of National Unity|ruling coalition]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34-36\">[[David Ost]], ''Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics'', pp. 34-36, 1990 Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]], {{ISBN|0-87722-655-5}}</ref>\n\n===After the fall of the regime===\nAround the time of the [[fall of communism]] several PSLs were recreated, including: [[Polish People's Party\u2013Peasants' Agreement|Porozumienie Ludowe]], Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe - Odrodzenie, and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (Wilan\u00f3w faction). In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] grouping, and in 1990 changed its name to PSL.\n\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s, entering into coalitions with the postcommunist [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. However, in the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary elections]] PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, an alliance which later broke down. Since then PSL has moved towards more [[centrism|centrist]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] policies.\n\n===After 2004===\nThe party ran in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Poland|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and received 6% of the vote, giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]] the party received 7% of votes, giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate. In the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] the party placed fourth, with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats, and entered into a governing coalition with the victor, the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right conservative]] [[Civic Platform]] (''Platforma Obywatelska'').\n\n===Current situation===\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009.\n\nIn [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 national parliamentary election]] Polish People's Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate.<ref name=\"pkw-results2011\">{{cite web|url=http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|title=Elections 2011 - Election results|publisher=National Electoral Commission|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075746/http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|archivedate=14 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote, just barely over the 5 percent threshold.

The party advocates [[economic protectionism]] by the state  (especially in agriculture), and \"slower [[privatization]]\" (although it is not against privatization). On social and ethical issues, PSL opposes abortion, same-sex marriage, soft drug decriminalization, euthanasia and death penalty. It also supports mandatory [[State school|public (state) education]] and [[publicly funded health care]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Support===\nParty traditionally representing farmers, peasants and rural voters generally. Voters are generally more [[social conservative]] than voters of [[Civic Platform]]. Regionally, it has more support in western parts of country. The party has less support in larger cities and mining areas of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

Occasionally termed ''neo-Orthodoxy'', his philosophy, together with that of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], has had a considerable influence on the development of [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman>{{cite book |author=Eliyahu Meir Klugman |title=Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: Architect of Judaism for the Modern World |publisher=Artscroll Mesorah |location=Brooklyn, NY |year=1996 |isbn=0-89906-632-1}}</ref>\n\nHirsch was rabbi in [[Oldenburg]], [[Emden]], and was subsequently appointed chief rabbi of [[Moravia]]. From 1851 until his death, Hirsch led the secessionist Orthodox community in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He wrote a number of influential books, and for a number of years published the monthly journal ''Jeschurun'', in which he outlined his philosophy of Judaism. He was a vocal opponent of [[Reform Judaism]], and similarly opposed early forms of [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Early years and education ==\nHirsch was born in [[Hamburg]], which was then a part of Napoleonic [[First French Empire|France]]. His father, though a merchant, devoted much of his time to [[Torah]] studies; his grandfather, Mendel Frankfurter, was the founder of the [[Talmud Torah]] schools in Hamburg and unsalaried assistant rabbi of the neighboring congregation of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]; and his granduncle, L\u00f6b Frankfurter, was the author of several Hebrew works, including ''Harechasim le-Bik'ah'' (\u05d4\u05e8\u05db\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05e7\u05e2\u05d4), a [[Torah]] commentary. Hirsch was a pupil of ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]], and the [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and [[Talmud]]ical education which he received, combined with his teacher's influence, led him to determine not to become a merchant, as his parents had desired, but to choose the rabbinical vocation. In furtherance of this plan, he studied [[Talmud]] from 1828 to 1829 in [[Mannheim]] under Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]]. He then entered the [[University of Bonn]], where he studied at the same time as his future antagonist, [[Abraham Geiger]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n==Career==\n=== Oldenburg ===\nIn 1830, Hirsch was elected [[chief rabbi]] (''Landesrabbiner'') of the [[principality]] of [[Oldenburg]]. During this period, he wrote his ''Neunzehn Briefe \u00fcber Judenthum,'' (''[[Nineteen Letters]] on Judaism'') which were published, under the pseudonym of \"Ben Usiel\" (or \"Uziel\"), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it was something new \u2014 a brilliant, intellectual presentation of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1838, Hirsch published, as a necessary concomitant of the ''Letters'', his ''Horeb, oder Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', which is a text-book on Judaism for educated Jewish youth. In fact, he wrote Horeb first, but his publishers doubted that a work defending traditional Judaism would find a market in those times, when reform was in vogue.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1839, he published ''Erste Mittheilungen aus Naphtali's Briefwechsel'', a polemical essay against the [[Reform Judaism|reforms in Judaism]] proposed by Geiger and the contributors to the latter's ''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Theologie'' (such as [[Michael Creizenach]]); and in 1844, he published ''Zweite Mittheilungen aus einem Briefwechsel \u00fcber die Neueste J\u00fcdische Literatur'', also polemical in tendency and attacking [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdheim's]] ''Die Autonomie der Rabbinen'' (1843).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Emden ===\nHirsch remained in Oldenburg until 1841, when he was elected chief rabbi of the Hanoverian districts of [[Aurich]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], with his residence in [[Emden]]. During this five-year post, he was taken up almost completely by communal work, and had little time for writing. He did, however, found a secondary school with a curriculum featuring both [[Judaism|Jewish studies]] and a secular program, for the first time employing his motto ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' (\"The Torah is maximalized in partnership with worldly involvement\").<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1843, Hirsch applied for the post of [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[British Empire]]. Out of 13 candidates, mostly from Germany, he reached the short list of four: [[Nathan Marcus Adler]], Hirsch Hirschfeld, [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], and Hirsch.<ref name=Klugman/> Adler won the position on December 1, 1844. With 135 communities having one vote each, Adler received 121 votes, Hirschfeld 12, and Hirsch 2.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rosenberg, Stephen Gabriel | title= Samson Raphael Hirsch: The British connection |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Guest-Column-Samson-Raphael-Hirsch-The-British-connection |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=2008-06-12 | accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Nikolsburg ===\nIn 1846, Hirsch was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] in [[Moravia]], and in 1847, he became chief rabbi of [[Moravia]] and Austrian Silesia. In Austria, he spent five years in the re-organization of the Jewish congregations and the instruction of numerous disciples; he was also, in his official capacity as chief rabbi, a member of the Moravian ''[[Landtag]]'', where he campaigned for more civil rights for Jews in Moravia.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn Moravia, Hirsch had a difficult time, on the one side receiving criticism from the Reform-minded, and on the other side from a deeply traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] element, which found some of his reforms too radical. Hirsch placed a much stronger emphasis on deep study of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], rather than just the [[Torah]] and selected Bible readings, in addition to [[Talmud]], as had been the custom of religious Jews up until then.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Frankfurt am Main ===\n[[Image:SamsonHirsch1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An 1868 illustration (despite the caption mentioning the \"Dr.\" title, Hirsch did not in fact have a doctorate).<ref name=Klugman/>]]\nIn 1851, he accepted a call as rabbi of an Orthodox separatist group in [[Frankfurt am Main]], a part of the Jewish community of which had otherwise largely accepted classical Reform Judaism. This group, known as the \"Israelite Religious Society\" (\"Israelitische Religions-Gesellschaft\", or IRG), became, under his administration, a great congregation, numbering about 500 families. Hirsch remained rabbi of this congregation for the rest of his life.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch organized the ''Realschule'' and the ''B\u00fcrgerschule'', in which thorough Jewish training was provided, along with those aspects of secular training deemed true according to the [[Torah]] (''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''). He also founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Jeschurun'' (1855\u20131870; new series, 1882 et seq); most of the pages of the Jeschurun were filled by himself.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1876, [[Edward Lasker (politician)|Edward Lasker]] (a Jewish parliamentarian in the [[Prussian Landtag]]) introduced the \"Secession Bill\" (''Austrittsgesetz''), which would enable Jews to secede from a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether \"''Austritt''\" (secession) was required by [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\" (''Grossgemeinde''). His contemporary [[Seligman Baer Bamberger|Isaac Dov Bamberger]], [[Rabbi]] of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], argued that as long as the ''Grossgemeinde'' made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many hurt feelings, and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Final years ===\nDuring the final years of his life, Hirsch put his efforts in the founding of the \"''Freie Vereinigung f\u00fcr die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums''\", an association of independent Jewish communities. During the 30 years after his death, this organization would be used as a model for the formation of the international Orthodox [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisrael]] movement. Hirsch had a great love for the [[Land of Israel]], which is apparent from his writings, but was opposed to the proto-[[Zionism|Zionist]] activities of [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nFrom reports of his family members, it seems likely that Hirsch contracted [[malaria]] while in Emden, which continued to plague him during the rest of life with febrile episodes.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch died in 1888 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and is buried there.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch's son [[:de:Mendel Hirsch|Mendel Hirsch]] {{in lang|de}} (1833\u20131900) was a scholar and writer; his granddaughter [[Rahel Hirsch]] (1870\u20131953) became the first female professor of medicine in [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Lindner, Petra | title=Rahel Hirsch | work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia | date=1 March 2009 | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hirsch-rahel}}</ref>\n\n== Works==\n[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch.

Hirsch\u2019s innovative and influential commentary on the Pentateuch (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung des Pentateuchs'', \"Translation and explanation of the Pentateuch\"), 5 volumes published 1867-78, has been \"hailed as a classic\" since the publication of the first volume, ''[[Book of Genesis|Bereshit]]''.\nAccording to Hirsch, the goal of the commentary was to expound the text by ascertaining the exact meaning of the words, their etymology, [[philology]], and origin, and, this achieved, \"to establish, on the basis of [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggada|aggadic]] interpretations, [[Hashkafah|the Jewish ''Weltanschauung]]''\".\n<ref>Simon Langer (1961).

Vol. 3, No. 2 (SPRING 1961), pp. 233-238 ]</ref>\nA feature of the commentary is its analysis of the meanings and symbols in the religious precepts ([[mitzvah|''mitzvot'']]), as below; this, again, as consistent with its discussion of the Hebrew.\nThe commentary gained worldwide popularity for its scope of insight and information offered to scholar and layman alike, and is still widely referenced.<ref>See for example, [https://torah.org/series/ravhirsch/ \"The Timeless Rav Hirsch\"] on torah.org</ref>\n[[Oral Torah #In rabbinic literature and commentary]] provides further context; and see also [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible #Acharonim (1600\u2013)]] and [[Yeshiva #Torah and Bible study]].\n\n===Nineteen Letters===\nHirsch's \"Nineteen Letters on Judaism\" (''Neunzehn Briefe \u00fcber Judenthum''), published 1836 under the pseudonym \"Ben Uziel\", offered an intellectual presentation of Orthodox Judaism in classic German, and a \"fearless, uncompromising defense\" of all its institutions and ordinances. See under [[#Oldenburg]] above.\nIt was written in the form of a fictional correspondence between a young rabbi / philosopher and a youthful intellectual.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters ''Nineteen Letters''] on [[sefaria]].org</ref> \nThe first letter, the intellectual's, outlines the challenges that [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] created for modern Jews, and questions the continued relevance of Judaism. The Rabbi responds in the subsequent letters, discussing, in a structured sequence, God, Man, and Jewish History; \nleading to a discussion of the ''Mitzvot'' and their classification (as employed in ''Horeb'').  \nThis work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles, and has been republished and translated several times;\nit is still influential, and often taught. <ref>See for example, [https://outorah.org/series/3115/ ''19 Letters''], lectures by Daniel Adler on outorah.org</ref>\n\n===Horeb===\n''Horeb'' (subtitled ''Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', \u201cEssays on the Duties of the Jewish People in the Diaspora\u201d), published 1838, is Rabbi Hirsch's presentation of Jewish law and observances, with particular emphasis on their underlying ideas, capturing the \"unifying ideological threads\"; \nthese discussions are still regularly taught and referenced.<ref>See for example [http://www.sarahlipman.com/horeb \"Rav Hirsch Horeb Shiurim\"], Sarah Lipman</ref>\nIt is organized into six sections, according to Hirsch's classification of the commandments. \nAs for the ''Letters'', its historical background is the [[Haskalah|enlightenment]], and particularly the beginnings of [[Reform Judaism]], and it thus constituted an attempt \"to lead the young generation of Jewry back to the Divine law.\"<ref>Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]]. [https://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/horebaphilosophy027897mbp.pdf ''Introduction to Horeb'']</ref>\nSee  also [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Themes in his work|below]].\nIn it Hirsch shows that the Torah's ''mitzvot'', are not mere \"ceremonies\", but \"duties\" of Israel. \nIt was then, to some extent, \"a necessary concomitant of the Letters\".\nIt was conceived, also, to deal with the practical observances of Judaism - providing summarised Halachot relevant to each sub-section.\n(The title is a reference to [[Mount Horeb]], another name for Mt. Sinai, {{bibleverse||Exodus|3:1|HE}}, where the [[Ten Commandments]] were given to Moses.)\n\n===Commentary on the ''Siddur'' and Psalms===\nHe left in manuscript at the time of his death a translation and explanation of the [[siddur|prayer-book]], which was subsequently published. \nHis commentary on [[Pirkei Avot]] has been republished separately. \nHis commentary on the book of [[Psalms]] (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung der Psalmen'', 1882) is still widely read; it underpins much of his ''siddur'' commentary.\n\n===Works of activism===\nWorks here (besides similar mentioned above) include:\n* Pamphlet: ''J\u00fcdische Anmerkungen zu den Bemerkungen eines Protestanten'' (anon.), Emden, 1841- response to a provocative and anti-Semitic pamphlet by an anonymous [[Protestant]]\n* Pamphlet: ''Die Religion im Bunde mit dem Fortschritt'' (anon.), Frankfurt am Main, 1854 - response to provocations from the side of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\"\n* Pamphlets during the Secession Debate:\n** ''Das Princip der Gewissensfreiheit'' (The principle of freedom of conscience), 1874\n** ''Der Austritt aus der Gemeinde'' (Leaving the community), 1876\n* ''Ueber die Beziehungen des Talmuds zum Judenthum'' (On the Talmud's Relationships with Judaism), 1884  - a defense of [[Talmud]]ic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia\n\n===Translations and collections===\nMost of Hirsch's writings have been translated into English and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by his descendants, starting with \"Horeb\" in the 1950s (by Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]] of London) and his [[Torah]] commentary in the 1960s (by his grandson Isaac Levi, also of London). Horeb was translated into Hebrew already in 1892.<ref>[https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/41649 Hebrew translation] @ hebrewbooks.org</ref>\n\nThe publication, in several volumes, of his collected writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'' or ''Nachalath Zwi'') was begun in 1902.<ref name=Klugman/> The bulk of these, that had previously been published in German in 1902-1912 under the title ''Nachalath Zwi'', were translated between 1984 and 2012 by the \"Rabbi Dr. [[Joseph Breuer]]  [https://www.rabbibreuerfoundation.org Foundation]\" (established to perpetuate the memory of Breuer, Hirsch's grandson, via publication of Hirsch's (and Breur's) writings).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Themes in his work ==\nHirsch lived in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, an epoch when Jews had been granted civil rights in a large number of European countries, leading to a call for [[Reform Judaism|reform]]. A large segment of his work focuses on the possibilities for [[Orthodox Judaism]] in such an era, when [[freedom of religion]] also meant the freedom to practice [[Torah]] precepts without persecution and ridicule.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nThe principle of \"''Austritt''\", an independent [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], flows naturally from his view on the place of [[Judaism]] in his epoch: If Judaism is to gain from these civil liberties, it has to be able to develop independently \u2014 without having to lend implicit or explicit approval to [[reform Judaism|efforts at reformation]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHis other major work involves the [[symbol]]ic meaning of many [[Torah]] commandments and passages. Indeed, his work \"Horeb\" (1837) focuses to a large degree on the possible meanings and symbols in religious precepts. This work was continued in his [[Torah]] commentary and his articles in the Jeschurun journal (''Collected Writings'', vol. III, is a collation of these articles).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nA final area of his work, which has only recently been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the [[Hebrew language]]. Most of this work is contained in his [[Torah]] commentary, where he analyses and compares the ''shorashim'' (three-letter root forms) of a large number of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a phonetic similarity, have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well. Although this effort was, in his own words, \"totally unscientific\", it has led to the recent publication of an \"etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |author2=Matityahu Clark |title=Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch |publisher=Feldheim |location=Jerusalem, New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=1-58330-431-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Hirsch does not mention his influences (apart from traditional Jewish sources), later authors have identified ideas from the [[Kuzari]] ([[Yehuda Halevi]]), [[Nahmanides]], and the [[Maharal of Prague]] in his works. Nevertheless, most of his ideas are original.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn a 1995 edition of Hirsch' Nineteen Letters, commentator Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch' sources in [[Rabbinic literature]], parallels in his other works and those of other post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers. Elias also attempts to refute particular interpretations of his philosophy, such as the notion that much of his thinking was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] secular philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joseph P. Elias |author2=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |title=The nineteen letters |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |location=Jerusalem |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-87306-696-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was not founded during his lifetime, it is clear from his responses to Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]], and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era.<ref name=Klugman/> In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.<ref>{{cite book | author=Samson Raphael Hirsch | title=Siddur | publisher=Feldheim | year=1969 | pages=703}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and controversy ==\n{{Refimprove section| date=June 2008}}\n{{further2|[[Torah im Derech Eretz#Interpretation|Torah im Derech Eretz]].}}\nThere is considerable controversy over Hirsch's legacy; this is a matter of debate amongst three parties: [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]], and Hirsch's descendants. While it is undisputed that his ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' was his real innovation, the exact implementation has been greatly debated.\n\nThose on Orthodoxy's right wing hold that Hirsch himself approved of secular studies as a \"Horaas Sha'ah\", or temporary dispensation, only in order to save Orthodox Jewry of the nineteenth century from the threat posed by assimilation. While a ''[[yeshiva]]'' student in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Shimon Schwab obtained the opinions of various [[Poskim]] (authorities in Jewish law) to this effect (see Selected Writings, \"These and Those\", where Schwab himself disagrees).\n\nAt the other end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews understand Hirsch in the sense of [[Torah Umadda]], meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its own sake (this view is propagated in several articles in ''Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought'', published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their own sake.\n\nIn contrast, a third middle opinion held by Hirsch's descendants (his son-in-law and successor Rabbi [[Solomon Breuer]], his grandson Rabbi [[Joseph Breuer]], and the latter's successor Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]]), Rabbi Joseph Elias, in his commentary to ''The Nineteen Letters'' (Feldheim 1995), and some Jewish historians say that both of these understandings of Hirsch's philosophy are misguided; they refer to these readings of Hirsch as improper historical revisionism. In response to the \"temporary dispensation\" theory, they point to Hirsch in Collected Writings as continually stressing the philosophical and religious imperative of Torah im Derech Eretz for all times. (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"Torah im Derech Eretz ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (Gesammelte Schriften vi p.&nbsp;221); see further Rabbi Shimon Schwab in Selected Writings - \"These and Those\".) In response to the \"[[Torah Umadda]]\" theory, they say that Hirschian philosophy demands the domination of Torah over secular knowledge, not a separate synthesis. On this basis, many adherents of Hirsch's philosophy have preferred the natural sciences over the humanities as a subject of secular study, seemingly because they are easier to judge through the prism of Torah thought than the more abstract humanities.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Nineteen Letters'', Translated by Karin Paritzky, annotated by Rabbi Joseph Elias.

Occasionally termed ''neo-Orthodoxy'', his philosophy, together with that of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], has had a considerable influence on the development of [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman>{{cite book |author=Eliyahu Meir Klugman |title=Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: Architect of Judaism for the Modern World |publisher=Artscroll Mesorah |location=Brooklyn, NY |year=1996 |isbn=0-89906-632-1}}</ref>\n\nHirsch was rabbi in [[Oldenburg]], [[Emden]], and was subsequently appointed chief rabbi of [[Moravia]]. From 1851 until his death, Hirsch led the secessionist Orthodox community in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He wrote a number of influential books, and for a number of years published the monthly journal ''Jeschurun'', in which he outlined his philosophy of Judaism. He was a vocal opponent of [[Reform Judaism]], and similarly opposed early forms of [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Early years and education ==\nHirsch was born in [[Hamburg]], which was then a part of Napoleonic [[First French Empire|France]]. His father, though a merchant, devoted much of his time to [[Torah]] studies; his grandfather, Mendel Frankfurter, was the founder of the [[Talmud Torah]] schools in Hamburg and unsalaried assistant rabbi of the neighboring congregation of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]; and his granduncle, L\u00f6b Frankfurter, was the author of several Hebrew works, including ''Harechasim le-Bik'ah'' (\u05d4\u05e8\u05db\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05e7\u05e2\u05d4), a [[Torah]] commentary. Hirsch was a pupil of ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]], and the [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and [[Talmud]]ical education which he received, combined with his teacher's influence, led him to determine not to become a merchant, as his parents had desired, but to choose the rabbinical vocation. In furtherance of this plan, he studied [[Talmud]] from 1828 to 1829 in [[Mannheim]] under Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]]. He then entered the [[University of Bonn]], where he studied at the same time as his future antagonist, [[Abraham Geiger]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n==Career==\n=== Oldenburg ===\nIn 1830, Hirsch was elected [[chief rabbi]] (''Landesrabbiner'') of the [[principality]] of [[Oldenburg]]. During this period, he wrote his ''Neunzehn Briefe \u00fcber Judenthum,'' (''[[Nineteen Letters]] on Judaism'') which were published, under the pseudonym of \"Ben Usiel\" (or \"Uziel\"), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it was something new \u2014 a brilliant, intellectual presentation of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1838, Hirsch published, as a necessary concomitant of the ''Letters'', his ''Horeb, oder Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', which is a text-book on Judaism for educated Jewish youth. In fact, he wrote Horeb first, but his publishers doubted that a work defending traditional Judaism would find a market in those times, when reform was in vogue.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1839, he published ''Erste Mittheilungen aus Naphtali's Briefwechsel'', a polemical essay against the [[Reform Judaism|reforms in Judaism]] proposed by Geiger and the contributors to the latter's ''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Theologie'' (such as [[Michael Creizenach]]); and in 1844, he published ''Zweite Mittheilungen aus einem Briefwechsel \u00fcber die Neueste J\u00fcdische Literatur'', also polemical in tendency and attacking [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdheim's]] ''Die Autonomie der Rabbinen'' (1843).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Emden ===\nHirsch remained in Oldenburg until 1841, when he was elected chief rabbi of the Hanoverian districts of [[Aurich]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], with his residence in [[Emden]]. During this five-year post, he was taken up almost completely by communal work, and had little time for writing. He did, however, found a secondary school with a curriculum featuring both [[Judaism|Jewish studies]] and a secular program, for the first time employing his motto ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' (\"The Torah is maximalized in partnership with worldly involvement\").<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1843, Hirsch applied for the post of [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[British Empire]]. Out of 13 candidates, mostly from Germany, he reached the short list of four: [[Nathan Marcus Adler]], Hirsch Hirschfeld, [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], and Hirsch.<ref name=Klugman/> Adler won the position on December 1, 1844. With 135 communities having one vote each, Adler received 121 votes, Hirschfeld 12, and Hirsch 2.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rosenberg, Stephen Gabriel | title= Samson Raphael Hirsch: The British connection |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Guest-Column-Samson-Raphael-Hirsch-The-British-connection |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=2008-06-12 | accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Nikolsburg ===\nIn 1846, Hirsch was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] in [[Moravia]], and in 1847, he became chief rabbi of [[Moravia]] and Austrian Silesia. In Austria, he spent five years in the re-organization of the Jewish congregations and the instruction of numerous disciples; he was also, in his official capacity as chief rabbi, a member of the Moravian ''[[Landtag]]'', where he campaigned for more civil rights for Jews in Moravia.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn Moravia, Hirsch had a difficult time, on the one side receiving criticism from the Reform-minded, and on the other side from a deeply traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] element, which found some of his reforms too radical. Hirsch placed a much stronger emphasis on deep study of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], rather than just the [[Torah]] and selected Bible readings, in addition to [[Talmud]], as had been the custom of religious Jews up until then.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Frankfurt am Main ===\n[[Image:SamsonHirsch1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An 1868 illustration (despite the caption mentioning the \"Dr.\" title, Hirsch did not in fact have a doctorate).<ref name=Klugman/>]]\nIn 1851, he accepted a call as rabbi of an Orthodox separatist group in [[Frankfurt am Main]], a part of the Jewish community of which had otherwise largely accepted classical Reform Judaism. This group, known as the \"Israelite Religious Society\" (\"Israelitische Religions-Gesellschaft\", or IRG), became, under his administration, a great congregation, numbering about 500 families. Hirsch remained rabbi of this congregation for the rest of his life.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch organized the ''Realschule'' and the ''B\u00fcrgerschule'', in which thorough Jewish training was provided, along with those aspects of secular training deemed true according to the [[Torah]] (''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''). He also founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Jeschurun'' (1855\u20131870; new series, 1882 et seq); most of the pages of the Jeschurun were filled by himself.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1876, [[Edward Lasker (politician)|Edward Lasker]] (a Jewish parliamentarian in the [[Prussian Landtag]]) introduced the \"Secession Bill\" (''Austrittsgesetz''), which would enable Jews to secede from a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether \"''Austritt''\" (secession) was required by [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\" (''Grossgemeinde''). His contemporary [[Seligman Baer Bamberger|Isaac Dov Bamberger]], [[Rabbi]] of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], argued that as long as the ''Grossgemeinde'' made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many hurt feelings, and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Final years ===\nDuring the final years of his life, Hirsch put his efforts in the founding of the \"''Freie Vereinigung f\u00fcr die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums''\", an association of independent Jewish communities. During the 30 years after his death, this organization would be used as a model for the formation of the international Orthodox [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisrael]] movement. Hirsch had a great love for the [[Land of Israel]], which is apparent from his writings, but was opposed to the proto-[[Zionism|Zionist]] activities of [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nFrom reports of his family members, it seems likely that Hirsch contracted [[malaria]] while in Emden, which continued to plague him during the rest of life with febrile episodes.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch died in 1888 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and is buried there.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch's son [[:de:Mendel Hirsch|Mendel Hirsch]] {{in lang|de}} (1833\u20131900) was a scholar and writer; his granddaughter [[Rahel Hirsch]] (1870\u20131953) became the first female professor of medicine in [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Lindner, Petra | title=Rahel Hirsch | work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia | date=1 March 2009 | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hirsch-rahel}}</ref>\n\n== Works==\n[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch.

Hirsch\u2019s innovative and influential commentary on the Pentateuch (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung des Pentateuchs'', \"Translation and explanation of the Pentateuch\"), 5 volumes published 1867-78, has been \"hailed as a classic\" since the publication of the first volume, ''[[Book of Genesis|Bereshit]]''.\nAccording to Hirsch, the goal of the commentary was to expound the text by ascertaining the exact meaning of the words, their etymology, [[philology]], and origin, and, this achieved, \"to establish, on the basis of [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggada|aggadic]] interpretations, [[Hashkafah|the Jewish ''Weltanschauung]]''\".\n<ref>Simon Langer (1961).

See under [[#Oldenburg]] above.\nIt was written in the form of a fictional correspondence between a young rabbi / philosopher and a youthful intellectual.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters ''Nineteen Letters''] on [[sefaria]].org</ref> \nThe first letter, the intellectual's, outlines the challenges that [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] created for modern Jews, and questions the continued relevance of Judaism. The Rabbi responds in the subsequent letters, discussing, in a structured sequence, God, Man, and Jewish History; \nleading to a discussion of the ''Mitzvot'' and their classification (as employed in ''Horeb'').  \nThis work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles, and has been republished and translated several times;\nit is still influential, and often taught. <ref>See for example, [https://outorah.org/series/3115/ ''19 Letters''], lectures by Daniel Adler on outorah.org</ref>\n\n===Horeb===\n''Horeb'' (subtitled ''Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', \u201cEssays on the Duties of the Jewish People in the Diaspora\u201d), published 1838, is Rabbi Hirsch's presentation of Jewish law and observances, with particular emphasis on their underlying ideas, capturing the \"unifying ideological threads\"; \nthese discussions are still regularly taught and referenced.<ref>See for example [http://www.sarahlipman.com/horeb \"Rav Hirsch Horeb Shiurim\"], Sarah Lipman</ref>\nIt is organized into six sections, according to Hirsch's classification of the commandments. \nAs for the ''Letters'', its historical background is the [[Haskalah|enlightenment]], and particularly the beginnings of [[Reform Judaism]], and it thus constituted an attempt \"to lead the young generation of Jewry back to the Divine law.\"<ref>Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]]. [https://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/horebaphilosophy027897mbp.pdf ''Introduction to Horeb'']</ref>\nSee  also [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Themes in his work|below]].\nIn it Hirsch shows that the Torah's ''mitzvot'', are not mere \"ceremonies\", but \"duties\" of Israel. \nIt was then, to some extent, \"a necessary concomitant of the Letters\".\nIt was conceived, also, to deal with the practical observances of Judaism - providing summarised Halachot relevant to each sub-section.\n(The title is a reference to [[Mount Horeb]], another name for Mt. Sinai, {{bibleverse||Exodus|3:1|HE}}, where the [[Ten Commandments]] were given to Moses.)\n\n===Commentary on the ''Siddur'' and Psalms===\nHe left in manuscript at the time of his death a translation and explanation of the [[siddur|prayer-book]], which was subsequently published. \nHis commentary on [[Pirkei Avot]] has been republished separately. \nHis commentary on the book of [[Psalms]] (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung der Psalmen'', 1882) is still widely read; it underpins much of his ''siddur'' commentary.\n\n===Works of activism===\nWorks here (besides similar mentioned above) include:\n* Pamphlet: ''J\u00fcdische Anmerkungen zu den Bemerkungen eines Protestanten'' (anon.), Emden, 1841- response to a provocative and anti-Semitic pamphlet by an anonymous [[Protestant]]\n* Pamphlet: ''Die Religion im Bunde mit dem Fortschritt'' (anon.), Frankfurt am Main, 1854 - response to provocations from the side of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\"\n* Pamphlets during the Secession Debate:\n** ''Das Princip der Gewissensfreiheit'' (The principle of freedom of conscience), 1874\n** ''Der Austritt aus der Gemeinde'' (Leaving the community), 1876\n* ''Ueber die Beziehungen des Talmuds zum Judenthum'' (On the Talmud's Relationships with Judaism), 1884  - a defense of [[Talmud]]ic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia\n\n===Translations and collections===\nMost of Hirsch's writings have been translated into English and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by his descendants, starting with \"Horeb\" in the 1950s (by Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]] of London) and his [[Torah]] commentary in the 1960s (by his grandson Isaac Levi, also of London). Horeb was translated into Hebrew already in 1892.<ref>[https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/41649 Hebrew translation] @ hebrewbooks.org</ref>\n\nThe publication, in several volumes, of his collected writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'' or ''Nachalath Zwi'') was begun in 1902.<ref name=Klugman/> The bulk of these, that had previously been published in German in 1902-1912 under the title ''Nachalath Zwi'', were translated between 1984 and 2012 by the \"Rabbi Dr. [[Joseph Breuer]]  [https://www.rabbibreuerfoundation.org Foundation]\" (being a foundation established to perpetuate his grandson's memory, via publication of Hirsch's, and his descendants, writings).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Themes in his work ==\nHirsch lived in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, an epoch when Jews had been granted civil rights in a large number of European countries, leading to a call for [[Reform Judaism|reform]]. A large segment of his work focuses on the possibilities for [[Orthodox Judaism]] in such an era, when [[freedom of religion]] also meant the freedom to practice [[Torah]] precepts without persecution and ridicule.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nThe principle of \"''Austritt''\", an independent [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], flows naturally from his view on the place of [[Judaism]] in his epoch: If Judaism is to gain from these civil liberties, it has to be able to develop independently \u2014 without having to lend implicit or explicit approval to [[reform Judaism|efforts at reformation]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHis other major work involves the [[symbol]]ic meaning of many [[Torah]] commandments and passages. Indeed, his work \"Horeb\" (1837) focuses to a large degree on the possible meanings and symbols in religious precepts. This work was continued in his [[Torah]] commentary and his articles in the Jeschurun journal (''Collected Writings'', vol. III, is a collation of these articles).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nA final area of his work, which has only recently been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the [[Hebrew language]]. Most of this work is contained in his [[Torah]] commentary, where he analyses and compares the ''shorashim'' (three-letter root forms) of a large number of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a phonetic similarity, have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well. Although this effort was, in his own words, \"totally unscientific\", it has led to the recent publication of an \"etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |author2=Matityahu Clark |title=Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch |publisher=Feldheim |location=Jerusalem, New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=1-58330-431-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Hirsch does not mention his influences (apart from traditional Jewish sources), later authors have identified ideas from the [[Kuzari]] ([[Yehuda Halevi]]), [[Nahmanides]], and the [[Maharal of Prague]] in his works. Nevertheless, most of his ideas are original.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn a 1995 edition of Hirsch' Nineteen Letters, commentator Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch' sources in [[Rabbinic literature]], parallels in his other works and those of other post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers. Elias also attempts to refute particular interpretations of his philosophy, such as the notion that much of his thinking was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] secular philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joseph P. Elias |author2=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |title=The nineteen letters |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |location=Jerusalem |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-87306-696-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was not founded during his lifetime, it is clear from his responses to Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]], and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era.<ref name=Klugman/> In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.<ref>{{cite book | author=Samson Raphael Hirsch | title=Siddur | publisher=Feldheim | year=1969 | pages=703}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and controversy ==\n{{Refimprove section| date=June 2008}}\n{{further2|[[Torah im Derech Eretz#Interpretation|Torah im Derech Eretz]].}}\nThere is considerable controversy over Hirsch's legacy; this is a matter of debate amongst three parties: [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]], and Hirsch's descendants. While it is undisputed that his ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' was his real innovation, the exact implementation has been greatly debated.\n\nThose on Orthodoxy's right wing hold that Hirsch himself approved of secular studies as a \"Horaas Sha'ah\", or temporary dispensation, only in order to save Orthodox Jewry of the nineteenth century from the threat posed by assimilation. While a ''[[yeshiva]]'' student in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Shimon Schwab obtained the opinions of various [[Poskim]] (authorities in Jewish law) to this effect (see Selected Writings, \"These and Those\", where Schwab himself disagrees).\n\nAt the other end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews understand Hirsch in the sense of [[Torah Umadda]], meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its own sake (this view is propagated in several articles in ''Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought'', published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their own sake.\n\nIn contrast, a third middle opinion held by Hirsch's descendants (his son-in-law and successor Rabbi [[Solomon Breuer]], his grandson Rabbi [[Joseph Breuer]], and the latter's successor Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]]), Rabbi Joseph Elias, in his commentary to ''The Nineteen Letters'' (Feldheim 1995), and some Jewish historians say that both of these understandings of Hirsch's philosophy are misguided; they refer to these readings of Hirsch as improper historical revisionism. In response to the \"temporary dispensation\" theory, they point to Hirsch in Collected Writings as continually stressing the philosophical and religious imperative of Torah im Derech Eretz for all times. (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"Torah im Derech Eretz ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (Gesammelte Schriften vi p.&nbsp;221); see further Rabbi Shimon Schwab in Selected Writings - \"These and Those\".) In response to the \"[[Torah Umadda]]\" theory, they say that Hirschian philosophy demands the domination of Torah over secular knowledge, not a separate synthesis. On this basis, many adherents of Hirsch's philosophy have preferred the natural sciences over the humanities as a subject of secular study, seemingly because they are easier to judge through the prism of Torah thought than the more abstract humanities.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Nineteen Letters'', Translated by Karin Paritzky, annotated by Rabbi Joseph Elias.
