He held that post until 1920.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1935''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003 p.154</ref> Evans was supported by Lloyd George's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] partners in the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]].<ref name=\"a1\" >The Times, 28 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\n===Liberal split===\nAt first it was reported that Evans might not be opposed as he was a Cardiganshire man; his father was Clerk to the County Council.<ref>The Times, 3 January 1921 p.12</ref> However, the local Liberal Association was representative of both Coalition and Independent Liberal wings of the party and neither group had a permanent advantage over the other. Attempts by those opposed to the Coalition had earlier tried to ensure that any replacement for Vaughan-Davies would not be another Coalition Liberal but although this resolution passed the executive committee, it was never ratified by the membership.<ref>Kinnear, ''The Fall of Lloyd George'' p.191</ref> Once Vaughan\u2013Davies' peerage was announced, a number of other possible by-election candidates put their names forward.  First it was announced that Sir Lewes Loveden Pryse, a local land owner, would stand in the by-election as a Liberal Anti-Waste candidate.<ref>The Times, 4 January 1921 p. 10</ref> A number of by-elections at this time were contested by members of the [[Anti-Waste League]] a [[political party]] founded in 1921 by [[Lord Rothermere]]. The party campaigned against what they saw as excessive government spending. It is not clear if Loveden Pryse was formally connected to the Anti-waste League or if he just taking advantage of a well-known political position close to his own views.\n\nTo resolve the issue of its choice of candidate, the Cardiganshire Liberal Association invited five potential candidates to address a meeting of the Association and to invite them to accept the outcome of the democratic decision, to use the secretary of the Association as their election agent, and to state if they were Coalitionists or 'free and independent Liberals'.<ref name=\"a2\" >The Times, 24 January 1921 p.10</ref> These men were Evans, Loveden Pryse, [[W. Llewelyn Williams]], [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] the former [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] and [[Recorder (law)|Recorder]] of [[Cardiff]] and two local [[Aldermen]], [[John Morgan Howell|J M Howell]] and D C Roberts.<ref>The Times, 7 January 1921 p. 11</ref> Howell refused to attend the meeting and announced that he supported Lloyd George.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=332-3}} In the meantime at a meeting in London of the newly formed Welsh Independent Liberal Association, attended by Llewelyn Williams, it was decided that if Cardiganshire Liberals chose a Coalition Liberal candidate, they would oppose him.<ref>The Times, 8 January 1921 p. 14</ref> As the other possible candidates dropped out of contention, the choice for Cardiganshire Liberals crystallised between Evans and Llewelyn Williams. Evans declared that if the Association selected a candidate who would not support the Coalition, he would stand anyway.<ref>The Times, 24 January p.10</ref>\n \nIn the event, at a rowdy meeting, Cardiganshire Liberals voted to adopt Llewelyn Williams. Of the 350 delegates invited to the selection meeting on 26 January 1921, 347 attended and voted by a majority of 206 to 127 in favour of Llewelyn Williams.<ref>The Times, 26 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\nThe election which followed led to the re-emergence of tensions within Cardiganshire Liberalism, which had lain dormant for years, between the rural areas of the hinterland and the middle-class seaside towns. It was in the rural areas that Williams found the greatest levels of support.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=333-4}}\n\n===Labour===\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] stated they had a candidate ready to stand if the outcome of the Liberal selection process produced a candidate who was unacceptable to them. It was assumed, that given Labour's opposition to the Coalition, that if Evans was chosen therefore Labour would contest the election.<ref name=\"a2\" /> In the end however they chose not to do so and Llewelyn Williams claimed he had secured Labour's wholehearted support in the by-election.<ref>The Times, 29 January 1921 p. 10</ref> He later received the public support of William Harris the organiser of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] who declared it was the duty of Labour to vote against the present government which, he said, was the enemy of the working man.<ref name=\"a3\" >The Times, 8 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n==Issues==\n===Agriculture===\nAgricultural policy was an early issue raised in the election. This was because the Cardiganshire Farmers' Union, a generally pro-Conservative organisation, held a meeting to question Captain Evans and decided to ask all candidates the same series of questions. They wanted to know if the candidates approved of farmers having to give up land to ex-soldiers, if they would support a reduction in the number of government inspectors supervising farmers and their work, particularly those operating under the Wages Boards. Although Loveden Pryse decided not to put himself up as a candidate, the issue of waste and government expenditure was raised in the election. The farmers wanted to know if the candidates would oppose increased spending on education, public health, land settlement and housing.<ref name=\"a1\" /> Despite the conservatism of the country people it was reported that Llewelyn Williams was receiving a good reception in the rural areas.<ref name=\"a4\" >The Times, 2 February 1921 p. 7</ref>\n\n===Waste===\nLlewelyn Williams picked up the Anti-Waste theme and declared that it was not by returning a tame official of the government that the Coalition could be held to account for its extravagance and its loss of control over the nation's finances.<ref>The Times, 3 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n===The record of the Coalition and the position of Lloyd George===\nLlewelyn Williams tried to rally traditional Liberal support by emphasising the influence in Lloyd George's government of the Conservatives (who were in the majority in the Coalition). He would be happy to support the Prime Minister he said, when he got rid of the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzons]], [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carsons]], [[Arthur Balfour|Balfours]] and [[Bonar Law]]s who only a few years before had been trying to cut his political throat over the [[Marconi scandal|Marconi case]].<ref>The Times, 31 January 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\nLlewelyn Williams was fiercely opposed to Lloyd George, his one-time friend,<ref>[[Kenneth O Morgan]], ''Wales in British Politics: 1868-1922''; University of Wales Press, 1963 pp. 295\u2013296</ref> whom he had broken with over the issue of [[conscription]] in 1916. According to one historian, Llewelyn Williams was paranoid about Lloyd George calling him a 'dictator' and a 'little devil who plagues us so.'<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 pp. 198\u2013199</ref> He also disliked intensely the government action against nationalist forces in Ireland and the use of the so-called [[Black and Tans]]. \n \nLlewelyn Williams sought to counter Evans' credentials as a Cardiganshire man by getting his wife to make an appeal to women voters as a native of the county.<ref name=\"a4\" /> This appeal was however decisively trumped by the appearance in the constituency of the wife of the Prime Minister. [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]] made a visit lasting four days in support of Captain Evans when she was received enthusiastically with bouquets and brass bands according to one source<ref>P J Madgwick, N Griffiths & V Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales: A Study of Cardiganshire; Hutchison, 1973 p46''</ref> and addressed a special meeting of women at [[Aberystwyth]].<ref name=\"a3\" /> Her campaigning concluded only on election day itself with a tour of polling stations and a last minute plea for votes published in the ''[[Cambrian News]]''.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p. 389</ref>\n\nEvans based his appeal on the reasons for maintaining the Coalition after 1918 and appealed for loyalty to Lloyd George as a great Welshman and war hero. There was an unashamed appeal to patriotism. Mrs Lloyd George told electors that the Germans were anxiously watching the result of the contest and the ''Cambrian News'' published a cartoon showing Prussian Militarism trying in vain to woo Miss Cardiganshire away from Lloyd George.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'', p 47</ref> Evans associated himself with the points made by Lloyd George at the executive meeting of the Welsh National Liberals on 8 February 1921. These were chiefly, the recognition that the emergency extended into the post-war phase; the need for national unity to face the challenges of the economy and demobilization after the war; the need for unity to enforce the post-war international settlement agreed at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|the Paris Peace Conference]] and the moves to find a solution to the question of [[Irish home rule|Home Rule for Ireland]].<ref>The Times, 9 February 1921 p. 12</ref> In a letter of support to Evans, Conservative leader Bonar Law also made similar points about the need for national unity and government o be carried on in a non-partisan way.<ref>The Times, 10 February 1921 p. 10</ref> Loyalty to the Prime Minister as a great Welsh figure was also reported to have been a factor in swaying the voters.<ref name=\"a5\" >The Times, 21 February 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne topic which was reported to have been a dead issue in the election was the Church question, a policy which for a generation was the central and burning issue of Welsh politics. [[Violet Bonham Carter]] tried to raise the issue in a speech at Aberystwyth, attacking Lloyd George for re-endowing the [[Anglican Church]] with taxpayers' money. But it seemed to leave the audience cold. The many sects in the Welsh [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]] found themselves divided between the different candidates, a dilemma with which they were highly unfamiliar<ref>The Times, 16 February 1921 p. 12</ref> and perhaps this lack of unity served to lessen the profile and importance of the [[Church in Wales|disestablishment]] tradition.  However, Evans was a [[Methodist]], which was the dominant denomination in the area,<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 p. 199</ref> as was Mrs Lloyd George<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 385</ref> while most supporters of Llewelyn Williams were [[Congregationalists]]. Ministers of religion frequently appeared on political platforms and political factionalism within the Liberal tradition spilled over into the politics of the chapels both between the demoninantions and within.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'' p. 48</ref> So religion certainly seems to have been, after all, more of factor than was believed by commentators at the time.\n\n===Polling day===\nIn this respect the Coalition had an advantage. In particular they were able to make use of many more motor vehicles to get their supporters to the poll which was important in a constituency like Cardiganshire which was full of outlying villages and farms. On election day it was said that 250 motor cars, mostly owned by Conservative backers of the Coalition, were brought out for the purpose of ferrying voters to the polling stations and this was a significant factor<ref>Jenny Rees, ''Looking for Mr Nobody: The Secret Life of Goronwy Rees''; Transaction Books, 2000 p. 25</ref> whereas Independent Liberals could muster only 50 cars in response.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 389</ref>\n\n==Result==\nIn what was reported to have been an unexpectedly heavy poll of 80%, Captain Evans won the seat for the Coalition by a majority of 3,590 votes.<ref name=\"Craig, F.

According to one historian, Llewelyn Williams was paranoid about Lloyd George calling him a 'dictator' and a 'little devil who plagues us so.'<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 pp. 198\u2013199</ref> He also disliked intensely the government action against nationalist forces in Ireland and the use of the so-called [[Black and Tans]]. \n \nLlewelyn Williams sought to counter Evans' credentials as a Cardiganshire man by getting his wife to make an appeal to women voters as a native of the county.<ref name=\"a4\" /> This appeal was however decisively trumped by the appearance in the constituency of the wife of the Prime Minister. [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]] made a visit lasting four days in support of Captain Evans when she was received enthusiastically with bouquets and brass bands according to one source<ref>P J Madgwick, N Griffiths & V Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales: A Study of Cardiganshire; Hutchison, 1973 p46''</ref> and addressed a special meeting of women at [[Aberystwyth]].<ref name=\"a3\" /> Her campaigning concluded only on election day itself with a tour of polling stations and a last minute plea for votes published in the ''[[Cambrian News]]''.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p. 389</ref>\n\nEvans based his appeal on the reasons for maintaining the Coalition after 1918 and appealed for loyalty to Lloyd George as a great Welshman and war hero. There was an unashamed appeal to patriotism. Mrs Lloyd George told electors that the Germans were anxiously watching the result of the contest and the ''Cambrian News'' published a cartoon showing Prussian Militarism trying in vain to woo Miss Cardiganshire away from Lloyd George.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'', p 47</ref> Evans associated himself with the points made by Lloyd George at the executive meeting of the Welsh National Liberals on 8 February 1921. These were chiefly, the recognition that the emergency extended into the post-war phase; the need for national unity to face the challenges of the economy and demobilization after the war; the need for unity to enforce the post-war international settlement agreed at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|the Paris Peace Conference]] and the moves to find a solution to the question of [[Irish home rule|Home Rule for Ireland]].<ref>The Times, 9 February 1921 p. 12</ref> In a letter of support to Evans, Conservative leader Bonar Law also made similar points about the need for national unity and government o be carried on in a non-partisan way.<ref>The Times, 10 February 1921 p. 10</ref> Loyalty to the Prime Minister as a great Welsh figure was also reported to have been a factor in swaying the voters.<ref name=\"a5\" >The Times, 21 February 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne topic which was reported to have been a dead issue in the election was the Church question, a policy which for a generation was the central and burning issue of Welsh politics. [[Violet Bonham Carter]] tried to raise the issue in a speech at Aberystwyth, attacking Lloyd George for re-endowing the [[Anglican Church]] with taxpayers' money. But it seemed to leave the audience cold. The many sects in the Welsh [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]] found themselves divided between the different candidates, a dilemma with which they were highly unfamiliar<ref>The Times, 16 February 1921 p. 12</ref> and perhaps this lack of unity served to lessen the profile and importance of the [[Church in Wales|disestablishment]] tradition.  However, Evans was a [[Methodist]], which was the dominant denomination in the area,<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 p. 199</ref> as was Mrs Lloyd George<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 385</ref> while most supporters of Llewelyn Williams were [[Congregationalists]]. Ministers of religion frequently appeared on political platforms and political factionalism within the Liberal tradition spilled over into the politics of the chapels both between the demoninantions and within.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'' p. 48</ref> So religion certainly seems to have been, after all, more of factor than was believed by commentators at the time.\n\n===Polling day===\nIn this respect the Coalition had an advantage. In particular they were able to make use of many more motor vehicles to get their supporters to the poll which was important in a constituency like Cardiganshire which was full of outlying villages and farms. On election day it was said that 250 motor cars, mostly owned by Conservative backers of the Coalition, were brought out for the purpose of ferrying voters to the polling stations and this was a significant factor<ref>Jenny Rees, ''Looking for Mr Nobody: The Secret Life of Goronwy Rees''; Transaction Books, 2000 p. 25</ref> whereas Independent Liberals could muster only 50 cars in response.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 389</ref>\n\n==Result==\nIn what was reported to have been an unexpectedly heavy poll of 80%, Captain Evans won the seat for the Coalition by a majority of 3,590 votes.<ref name=\"Craig, F.

It also prevented either Liberal faction from claiming undisputed right to the Liberal name and tradition and was doubly confusing to potential voters at a time when electoral loyalties were in a state of flux.\"<ref>David Powell, ''British Politics 1910-1935:The Crisis of the Party System''; Routledge, 2004 p. 103</ref> The damage was exemplified by the support Llewelyn Williams received from a number of literary and intellectual figures and from the representatives of organised Labour.

However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement.

As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.<ref>Fischer (1995).

''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref> Prior to his ministry, Seldte served as the Federal Leader of ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' [[World War I]] ex-[[Serviceman|servicemen]]'s organisation from 1918 to 1934. Ideologically, he identified as a [[national conservative]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[Magdeburg]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] province of [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]], Seldte was the son of an owner of a factory producing chemical products and soda water.<ref>Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref> He attended the Wilhelm-Raabe-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Magdeburg and, after an apprenticeship as a salesman, studied chemistry at the universities of [[Braunschweig University of Technology|Braunschweig]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. In 1908 he took over the business of his early deceased father.<ref>Wistrich (2001). ''Who's Who In Nazi Germany'', p. 232.</ref> As an officer of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] he was wounded in [[World War I]] and lost his left arm.<ref>Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref>  He then became a front reporter. Awarded with the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd and 1st class,<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref> Seldte also was promoted to the rank of ''[[Hauptmann|Hauptmann d.R.]]'' in the 66th Infantry Regiment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''Der Stahlhelm''==\nAs a reaction to the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], Seldte founded ''Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten'' on 25 December 1918, agitating against the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and German [[World War I reparations|war reparations]]. According to Seldte, the organization was to use the spirit of the ''Frontsoldaten'' against the \u2018swinish revolution\u2019 taking place in Germany under the Weimar government.<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref> While he took charge of ''Der Stahlhelm'' from 1923 onwards, he had to cope with the constant rivalry of his deputy leader, the militant [[Theodor Duesterberg]].\n\nSeldte became a member of the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and was a member of the Magdeburg city council (''Stadtrat'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01258, Hugenberg, von Stephani und Seldte.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Seldte (r.) with Hugenberg and the Berlin Stahlhelm leader von Stephani at a rally against the Young-Plan, [[Berlin Sportpalast]], 1929]]\nDuring the later years of the [[Weimar Republic]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' became increasingly anti-democratic and anti-republican. However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement. In 1929 it united its forces with the DNVP under [[Alfred Hugenberg]], the [[Pan-German League]] and the [[Nazi Party]] to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]].<ref>Kershaw (2000). ''Hitler: 1889-1936, Hubris'', p. 310, 356.</ref>  The common goal was to denounce the Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] and his ministers as traitors to their country, nevertheless the plebiscite failed to reach the [[quorum]]. In 1931 Seldte helped create the short-lived [[Harzburg Front]],<ref>Zentner & Bed\u00fcrftig, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', vol. 2, (M-Z), p. 869.</ref> a right-wing alliance against the government of M\u00fcller's successor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]].\n\n==Minister for Labour==\nDuring the negotiations for the Chancellorship of Germany between [[Franz von Papen]] and Hitler in mid-January 1933, Seldte threw his vote and ''Der Stahlhelm'' behind Hitler, after which, Papen acquiesced to Hitler\u2019s demands.<ref>Longerich (2012). ''Heinrich Himmler'', p. 144.</ref> On the day of the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' on 30 January 1933, Seldte joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour,<ref>Shirer (1990). ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 184.</ref> once again outdoing his long-time rival Duesterberg. In the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|elections of March 1933]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' together with Hugenberg's national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) attempted to make the ''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'' (\"[[National colours of Germany|Black White Red]] Combat Front\") into the dominant political camp on the right, but ultimately failed as it only gained 8.0% of the votes cast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nevertheless, Seldte obtained a seat in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' parliament as a DNVP \"guest\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn 27 April 1933 Seldte finally joined the Nazi Party and merged ''Der Stahlhelm'' into [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]'s ''[[Sturmabteilung]] (SA)'' militia \u2013 de facto placing it at the disposal of Hitler.<ref>Bracher (1970). ''The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism'', p. 222.</ref> In August 1933, he was awarded the rank of ''SA-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' and later was appointed [[Reichskommissar]] for the ''Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst'' employment program, but was soon superseded by his state secretary [[Konstantin Hierl]] as leader of the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In March 1934 Seldte was made the federal leader of the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)'' ({{lang-en|National Socialist German Combatants' Federation (Stahlhelm)}}) (NSDFBSt), a successor organization of ''Der Stahlhelm'', which however was soon disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1935 he requested to be released from official responsibilities, but Hitler refused.\n\nThroughout his tenure as chief of the Labor Ministry, Seldte never enjoyed the full support of Hitler, who did not think he was worth much. As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.<ref>Fischer (1995). ''Nazi Germany: A New History'', p. 315.</ref> For instance, Hermann Goering\u2019s Four Year Plan which he began to implement in late 1936, ran roughshod over Seldte's Labor Ministry altogether.<ref>Evans (2006). ''The Third Reich in Power'', p. 358.</ref> Seldte, without substantial power, remained Reich Minister for Labour until the end of [[World War II]] and was also a member of the [[Free State of Prussia (1933\u20131947)|Prussian]] government under Minister president [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as State Labour Minister. Even after Hitler\u2019s suicide and the nomination of Grand-Admiral D\u00f6nitz as his successor, Seldte kept his post, being accordingly named Labour Minister.<ref>Mazower (2009). ''Hitler\u2019s Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'', pp. 532\u2013533.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nSeldte was captured and arrested in [[Mondorf-les-Bains]] at the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} During the Nuremberg trials, Seldte tried to exonerate himself by claiming that he had stood against the dictatorship of Hitler and that he advocated for a two-chamber system of parliamentary governance.<ref>Taylor & Shaw (2002). ''Dictionary of the Third Reich'', p. 261.</ref> His story was not convincing. Seldte died in a US military hospital in April 1947 at [[F\u00fcrth]], before the Nuremberg Tribunal had the chance to formally arraign him on charges.<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref>\n\nDuring the time of [[Nazi Germany]], streets were named after him in several German cities, among them his hometown Magdeburg and [[Leverkusen]].<ref>[http://www.leverkusen.com/strasse/index.php4?view=Seldte Franz-Seldte-Str.
