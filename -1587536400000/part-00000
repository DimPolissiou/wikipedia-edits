The original band included [[Vincent Crane]] ([[Hammond organ]] and piano), Drachen Theaker  (drums), and Nick Greenwood (bass). This early incarnation were noted for Crane's organ and brass arrangement and Brown's powerful, wide-ranging operatic voice.\n\nTheir song \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\" (released in 1968 as a single) sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]]<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/236 236]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/236}}</ref> reaching number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and Canada, and number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=2 |title=Official UK Singles Top 100 \u2013 16th February 2013 &#124; Official UK Top 40 &#124; music charts &#124; Official Singles Chart |publisher= |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> as well as its parent album ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]'' which reached number 2 on the UK album charts and number 7 in the US.<ref name=occarthurbrown>{{cite web|title=Crazy World of Arthur Brown - Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13318/crazy-world-of-arthur-brown/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown's popularity was such that the group shared bills with [[the Who]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[the Doors]], [[the Small Faces]], and [[Joe Cocker]], among others.<ref name=\"Unterberger\">Richie Unterberger (2014). \"Urban Spacemen & Wayfaring Strangers [Revised & Expanded Ebook Edition]: Overlooked Innovators & Eccentric Visionaries of '60s Rock\".

''Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers'', p. 46.</ref>\n\n==History==\nBrown quickly earned a reputation for both his powerful operatic voice (which spanned four octaves) and his outlandish performances, including the use of a burning metal helmet, which led to occasional mishaps. During an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, Brown wore a [[colander]] on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident caught fire; two bystanders doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown\u2019s head, preventing any serious injury.<ref>{{Cite news |first= David |last= Peisner |title= Rock Stars Who've Caught Fire Onstage! |date = February 2007| publisher= Blender Magazine Online |url= http://www.talkbass.com/threads/rock-stars-whove-caught-fire-onstage.626275/ |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature. On occasion he also stripped naked while performing, most notably in Italy, where, after setting his hair on fire, he was arrested and deported.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{Cite news| first= Polly | last= Marshall | title= The God Of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown |isbn=0-946719-77-2 | publisher= SAF Publishing}}</ref> He was also notable for the extreme make-up he wore onstage, which would later be reflected in the stage acts of [[Alice Cooper]],<ref>Marshall 2005, pp. 85 and 153.</ref> [[Peter Gabriel]],<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 175.</ref> [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]],<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 172.</ref> and [[Bruce Dickinson]]<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 103.</ref> among others.\n\nBy 1968, the debut album, ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]'' became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by [[The Who]]'s manager [[Kit Lambert]], and executive-produced by [[Pete Townshend]] on Track Records, the label begun by Lambert and [[Chris Stamp]], it spun off an equally surprising hit single, \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\", and contained a version of \"[[I Put a Spell on You]]\" by [[Screaming Jay Hawkins]], a similarly bizarre showman. \"Fire\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" /> The song has since seen its opening line \"I am the God of Hellfire\" [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] in numerous other places, most notably in [[The Prodigy]]'s 1992 rave anthem \"[[Fire/Jericho|Fire]]\", and more recently in [[Death Grips]]' \"Lord of the Game\", from 2011.\n\nTheaker was replaced because of his [[aviophobia]] in 1968 by [[Chris Farlowe]] & The Thunderbirds drummer [[Carl Palmer]], later of [[Atomic Rooster]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] and [[Asia (band)|Asia]] for the band's second American tour in 1969, on which keyboardist Vincent Crane also left\u2014although he soon returned.<ref name=\"Larkin\">Larkin C, ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music'' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) {{ISBN|0-7535-0149-X}}, page 77</ref> The band recorded a second album, titled ''Strangelands'', intended for release in 1969 but shelved by their label over concerns that it lacked sales potential. The album featured a more experimental and avant-garde sound that shed the pop sensibilities of the Crazy World's debut. ''Strangelands'' was not issued until 1988.\n\nThe new lineup practically dissolved on the band's US tour in June 1969. Crane and Palmer left to form [[Atomic Rooster]], Greenwood, known as Sean Nicholas during his time in the band, went on to [[Khan (band)|Khan]]<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Prog Archives| accessdate = 31 May 2008|title=Nicholas Greenwood|url = http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=3438}}</ref> where he performed under the name Nick Greenwood.

The original band included [[Vincent Crane]] ([[Hammond organ]] and piano), Drachen Theaker  (drums), and Nick Greenwood (bass). This early incarnation were noted for Crane's organ and brass arrangement and Brown's powerful, wide-ranging operatic voice.\n\nTheir song \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\" (released in 1968 as a single) sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]]<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/236 236]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/236}}</ref> reaching number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and Canada, and number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=2 |title=Official UK Singles Top 100 \u2013 16th February 2013 &#124; Official UK Top 40 &#124; music charts &#124; Official Singles Chart |publisher= |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> as well as its parent album ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]'' which reached number 2 on the UK album charts and number 7 in the US.<ref name=occarthurbrown>{{cite web|title=Crazy World of Arthur Brown - Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13318/crazy-world-of-arthur-brown/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown's popularity was such that the group shared bills with [[the Who]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[the Doors]], [[the Small Faces]], and [[Joe Cocker]], among others.<ref name=\"Unterberger\">Richie Unterberger (2014). \"Urban Spacemen & Wayfaring Strangers [Revised & Expanded Ebook Edition]: Overlooked Innovators & Eccentric Visionaries of '60s Rock\". BookBaby</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the single \"Fire\", the press would often refer to Brown as \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The God of Hellfire]]\",{{sfn|Echard|2005|p=43}} in reference to the opening shouted line of the song, a moniker that exists to this day.<ref>Unterberger, Richie. ''Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers'', p. 46.</ref>\n\n==History==\nBrown quickly earned a reputation for both his powerful operatic voice (which spanned four octaves) and his outlandish performances, including the use of a burning metal helmet, which led to occasional mishaps. During an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, Brown wore a [[colander]] on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident caught fire; two bystanders doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown\u2019s head, preventing any serious injury.<ref>{{Cite news |first= David |last= Peisner |title= Rock Stars Who've Caught Fire Onstage! |date = February 2007| publisher= Blender Magazine Online |url= http://www.talkbass.com/threads/rock-stars-whove-caught-fire-onstage.626275/ |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature. On occasion he also stripped naked while performing, most notably in Italy, where, after setting his hair on fire, he was arrested and deported.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{Cite news| first= Polly | last= Marshall | title= The God Of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown |isbn=0-946719-77-2 | publisher= SAF Publishing}}</ref> He was also notable for the extreme make-up he wore onstage, which would later be reflected in the stage acts of [[Alice Cooper]],<ref>Marshall 2005, pp. 85 and 153.</ref> [[Peter Gabriel]],<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 175.</ref> [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]],<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 172.</ref> and [[Bruce Dickinson]]<ref>Marshall 2005, p. 103.</ref> among others.\n\nBy 1968, the debut album, ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]'' became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by [[The Who]]'s manager [[Kit Lambert]], and executive-produced by [[Pete Townshend]] on Track Records, the label begun by Lambert and [[Chris Stamp]], it spun off an equally surprising hit single, \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\", and contained a version of \"[[I Put a Spell on You]]\" by [[Screaming Jay Hawkins]], a similarly bizarre showman. \"Fire\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" /> The song has since seen its opening line \"I am the God of Hellfire\" [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] in numerous other places, most notably in [[The Prodigy]]'s 1992 rave anthem \"[[Fire/Jericho|Fire]]\", and more recently in [[Death Grips]]' \"Lord of the Game\", from 2011.\n\nTheaker was replaced because of his [[aviophobia]] in 1968 by [[Chris Farlowe]] & The Thunderbirds drummer [[Carl Palmer]], later of [[Atomic Rooster]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] and [[Asia (band)|Asia]] for the band's second American tour in 1969, on which keyboardist Vincent Crane also left\u2014although he soon returned.<ref name=\"Larkin\">Larkin C, ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music'' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) {{ISBN|0-7535-0149-X}}, page 77</ref> The band recorded a second album, titled ''Strangelands'', intended for release in 1969 but shelved by their label over concerns that it lacked sales potential. The album featured a more experimental and avant-garde sound that shed the pop sensibilities of the Crazy World's debut. ''Strangelands'' was not issued until 1988.\n\nThe new lineup practically dissolved on the band's US tour in June 1969. Crane and Palmer left to form [[Atomic Rooster]], Greenwood, known as Sean Nicholas during his time in the band, went on to [[Khan (band)|Khan]]<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Prog Archives| accessdate = 31 May 2008|title=Nicholas Greenwood|url = http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=3438}}</ref> where he performed under the name Nick Greenwood. Theaker went to join [[Love (band)|Love]] and then Rustic Hinge, and Arthur Brown eventually joined [[Kingdom Come (British band)|Kingdom Come]].\n\nThe band re-formed in 2000 and released ''Tantric Lover''.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=5531151&cart=624594065&BAB=E |title=Arthur Brown \u2013 Tantric Lover CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com
