The battle was fought in the initial stage of the [[Vardar Offensive]], in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkans Theatre]]. On September 15, a combined [[Allied Army of the Orient|force]] of Serbian, French and Greek troops attacked the Bulgarian-held trenches in  [[Dobro Pole]] (\"Good Field\"), at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (present day [[North Macedonia]]). The offensive and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale, eventually leading to mass desertions.\n\nDespite being outnumbered and poorly equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] advance in [[Voreino|Zborsko]]. However, the collapse of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The [[Central Powers]]' defeat at the Dobro Pole played a role in the Bulgarian withdrawal from the war and opened the way for the subsequent capture of [[Vardar Macedonia]].\n\n==Prelude==\nThe 28 June 1914, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of  Austro-Hungarian [[heir presumptive]] Archduke Franz Ferdinand  precipitated [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war against [[Serbia]]. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the [[Central Powers]] against the [[Allies of World War I|Entente coalition]], and starting [[World War I]].{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=36}}{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}}{{sfn|Willmott|2003|pp=11\u201315}}\n\nSerbia was ultimately defeated during the autumn 1915 phase of the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I#Course of the Campaign|Serbian Campaign]], prompting France and Britain to transfer troops from the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] to [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. The [[Macedonian front]] was thus established to support the remnants of the Serbian army in their effort to conquer Vardar Macedonia.{{sfn|Hall|2010|pp=48\u201350}}\n\nOn 17 August 1916, Bulgaria [[Struma Offensive|invaded Greece]], easily conquering all Greek territory east of the [[Struma (river)|Struma]], since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the [[National Schism]]. In June 1917, the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war, along with the 24 division reinforcements that the army had received in the spring of the same year, created a strategic advantage for the Entente.{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=152\u2013184}}{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=208\u2013230}}{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=348\u2013362}}\n\nIn late July 1918, Bulgarian [[commander-in-chief]] [[Nikola Zhekov]] sent German field marshal general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permitted it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=111}}\n\nThe Bulgarians, using information from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake [[Ohrid]], in [[Bitola|Monastir]], Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy [[howitzer]]s, General [[Friedrich von Scholtz]] then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible. Von Scholtz had, however, failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]. Widespread [[insubordination]] and [[desertion]]s also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works. Poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nA day prior to the Entente offensive, General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] laid out the final plan for the operation. The first phase consisted of a combined Franco-Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions, which was expected to create a breach of the frontline in the area of Dobro Pole, while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river [[Vardar]]. The {{convert|1,875|m|adj=on}} Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\") peak dominated the region, providing excellent observation points for the defenders. Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well-developed system of trenches which, in combination with the rough terrain, made the area impassable for wheeled transport. Dobro Pole was, however, lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged {{convert|2,000|m}}.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=89}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nA second Anglo-Franco-[[Greece|Hellenic]] force would then attack the [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Bulgarian Army]] between [[Ko\u017euf]] and [[Lake Doiran]], preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area. The initial advance would allow the [[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]] to progress in support of other units first to [[Prilep]], Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount [[Belasica]], occupying the [[Rupel Pass]].{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nD'Esp\u00e8rey expected to march the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] through the towns of [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]], Rupel, Petrici, Blagusa, Gradec, [[\u0160tip]] and Belessa finally seizing Skopje. Units stationed at Katsania and [[Tetovo]] would prevent a Bulgarian [[flanking maneuver]], while the main body of the force would widen the breach both in \u0160tip and Prilep. In case of a collapse of the front between Dobro Pole and Tzena, the [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Bulgarian]] and [[11th German-Bulgarian Army|11th German]] armies would either be annihilated or, in less favorable circumstances, perform an organised retreat to a new defensive line on river [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]]. The prevention of such a retreat was to be achieved by a rapid, penetrating attack on [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]], [[:mk:\u0414\u0440\u0435\u043d (\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430)|Dren Planina]] and Visoka.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=130}}\n\n==Battle==\n [[File:Nudisti\u010dka pla\u017ea na Crna.jpg|thumb|right|270px|German soldiers bathing in the [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]] river in 1918]]\nAt 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on 14 September 1918, Entente forces commenced a 566-gun artillery barrage on enemy positions. Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250-truck column moving towards [[Kozjak (Prilep)|Kozjak]]. On the same day, Scholtz sent Hindenburg a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] stating that\n\"all indications point out that an enemy offensive will target the 11th Army on both sides of Vardar as well as Dobro Pole&nbsp;...\"\nThe Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian ''[[esprit de corps]]''. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 125}}\n\nAt 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on 15 September, the French 122nd and 17th (Colonial) divisions struck Sokol, Dobro Pole, Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik. The Greek [[Archipelago Division|Archipelago]], [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th divisions]] under [[Panagiotis Gargalidis]] acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat. The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground. During the course of the battle, the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties. The left column managed to reach a position located {{convert|50|m}} from Sokol at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day. At 4:00&nbsp;p.m., the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a {{convert|200|m|adj=on}} segment of steep terrain. The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., suppressing the last signs of resistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 117, 125}}, {{harvnb|Hall|2010|p=130}}, {{harvnb|Korsun|1939|p=98}}</ref>\n\nTwo Franco-Greek regiments attempted to storm [[Voreino|Zborsko]] but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian [[Rear (military)|rear]] and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 4:00&nbsp;p.m., the Serbian [[First Army (Serbia)|1st Army]]'s thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results. An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40\u201350 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 [[prisoners of war]], 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces. Entente casualties amounted to 1,700 Frenchmen and 200 Serbians killed in action.<ref>{{harvnb|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=115\u2013116, 118\u2013119, 126}}, {{harvnb|Korsun|1939|p=98}}, {{harvnb|Villari|1922|p=226}}, {{harvnb|Coates Ulrichsen|2014|p=95}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BULGARIAN SENIOR MILITARY LEADERSHIP IN WORLD WAR I: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE BULGARIAN ARMY OPERATIONS AT DOBRO POLE AND DOIRAN IN 1918|work=MASTER OF MILITARY ART AND SCIENCE Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

They were joined by the 35th Greek Regiment which crossed the Poroi river and later marching on Topolets. At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Franco-Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended. [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]]'s 1st Army and the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'' performed a night attack on the [[Grade\u0161nica]] fortified zone, suppressing the defenders. The 1st Division Group moved into a position on the Poroi river north of Brahovo in conjunction with  the Timok Division. By the night of 16 September, the gap in what formerly constituted the front-line had extended to {{convert|25|km}} in width and {{convert|7|km}} in depth. The Allied command ordered its air department to continue attacking all bridges on the river Vardar.{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=118\u2013119, 120\u2013122}}\n\nAt 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic components of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Grade\u0161nica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=122\u2013123}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\nOn 18 September, the 11th French Colonial Division and the 6th Greek Regiment occupied the villages of [[Zovi\u1e31]], [[Staravina]] and [[:mk:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d|Cebren]], approaching towards the [[:mk:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440|Cebren Monastery]] bridge on [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]]. An Entente [[Airstrike|air raid]] destroyed another bridge north of Razim Bey. Bulgarian forces failed at putting a stop to the Allied offensive, abandoning their wounded and large quantities of military equipment. By the end of the day, Allied troops had advanced {{convert|15|km}} into enemy territory while also seizing locales of strategic importance that would later enable them to continue pushing deeper into [[Vardar Macedonia]].{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Francuski Grobista Skopje (20).JPG|thumb|French military cemetery in Skopje]]\nImmediately following the battle, Entente forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|Battle of Doiran]] at Lake Doiran on 18 September. However, the breach of the defensive line at Dobro Pole enabled the Allies to penetrate into Vardar Macedonia and send reinforcements to Doiran. The Bulgarians rushed to the defense of their homeland, abandoning Vardar Macedonia, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. Having suffered heavy losses at Doiran, the Allied forces allowed the Bulgarians to peacefully withdraw over the border. A combination of multiple factors, including combat fatigue and poor supplies, led to the [[Radomir Rebellion]]. On 25 September, a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at [[Kyustendil]], looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight. The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of [[Radomir (town)|Radomir]] in Bulgaria, just {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the capital city of Sofia. On 27 September, the leaders of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic. About {{nowrap|4,000\u20135,000}} rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=124\u2013125}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BULGARIAN SENIOR MILITARY LEADERSHIP IN WORLD WAR I: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE BULGARIAN ARMY OPERATIONS AT DOBRO POLE AND DOIRAN IN 1918|work=MASTER OF MILITARY ART AND SCIENCE Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the [[Armistice of Salonica]] by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the [[Central Powers]]. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect, and the Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October. Tsar [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] abdicated and went into exile the following day.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=491}}\n\nImportance of Armistice of Salonica was best described by German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in his telegram to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I]]: \u201cDisgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://militaryhistorynow.com/2017/09/21/knock-out-blow-at-dobro-polje-six-facts-about-the-obscure-battle-that-ended-ww1/|title=The Battle of Dobro Polje \u2013 The Forgotten Balkan Skirmish That Ended WW1 {{!}} Militaryhistorynow.com|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historycollection.co/ten-facts-battle-dobro-polje-battle-led-allied-victory-world-war/9/|title=The Germans Could no Longer Keep up the Fight {{!}} historycollection.co|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>.

The British Army neared Constantinople and, without a force capable to stopping the advance, the Ottoman government asked for an armistice (the [[Armistice of Mudros]]) on 26 October. In Serbia, \"Desperate Frankie\" (as the British nicknamed d'Esperey) continued to advance and [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|the Serbo-French Army re-captured the country]], overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near [[Ni\u0161]]. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary was forced to sign an [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|armistice]] on the Italian Front ending the war there.

fought between 15 and 18 September 1918. The battle was fought in the initial stage of the [[Vardar Offensive]], in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkans Theatre]]. On September 15, a combined [[Allied Army of the Orient|force]] of Serbian, French and Greek troops attacked the Bulgarian-held trenches in  [[Dobro Pole]] (\"Good Field\"), at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (present day [[North Macedonia]]). The offensive and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale, eventually leading to mass desertions.\n\nDespite being outnumbered and poorly equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] advance in [[Voreino|Zborsko]]. However, the collapse of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The [[Central Powers]]' defeat at the Dobro Pole played a role in the Bulgarian withdrawal from the war and opened the way for the subsequent capture of [[Vardar Macedonia]].\n\n==Prelude==\nThe 28 June 1914, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of  Austro-Hungarian [[heir presumptive]] Archduke Franz Ferdinand  precipitated [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war against [[Serbia]]. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the [[Central Powers]] against the [[Allies of World War I|Entente coalition]], and starting [[World War I]].{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=36}}{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}}{{sfn|Willmott|2003|pp=11\u201315}}\n\nSerbia was ultimately defeated during the autumn 1915 phase of the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I#Course of the Campaign|Serbian Campaign]], prompting France and Britain to transfer troops from the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] to [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. The [[Macedonian front]] was thus established to support the remnants of the Serbian army in their effort to conquer Vardar Macedonia.{{sfn|Hall|2010|pp=48\u201350}}\n\nOn 17 August 1916, Bulgaria [[Struma Offensive|invaded Greece]], easily conquering all Greek territory east of the [[Struma (river)|Struma]], since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the [[National Schism]]. In June 1917, the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war, along with the 24 division reinforcements that the army had received in the spring of the same year, created a strategic advantage for the Entente.{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=152\u2013184}}{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=208\u2013230}}{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=348\u2013362}}\n\nIn late July 1918, Bulgarian [[commander-in-chief]] [[Nikola Zhekov]] sent German field marshal general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permitted it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=111}}\n\nThe Bulgarians, using information from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake [[Ohrid]], in [[Bitola|Monastir]], Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy [[howitzer]]s, General [[Friedrich von Scholtz]] then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible. Von Scholtz had, however, failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]. Widespread [[insubordination]] and [[desertion]]s also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works. Poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nA day prior to the Entente offensive, General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] laid out the final plan for the operation. The first phase consisted of a combined Franco-Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions, which was expected to create a breach of the frontline in the area of Dobro Pole, while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river [[Vardar]]. The {{convert|1,875|m|adj=on}} Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\") peak dominated the region, providing excellent observation points for the defenders. Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well-developed system of trenches which, in combination with the rough terrain, made the area impassable for wheeled transport. Dobro Pole was, however, lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged {{convert|2,000|m}}.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=89}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nA second Anglo-Franco-[[Greece|Hellenic]] force would then attack the [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Bulgarian Army]] between [[Ko\u017euf]] and [[Lake Doiran]], preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area. The initial advance would allow the [[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]] to progress in support of other units first to [[Prilep]], Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount [[Belasica]], occupying the [[Rupel Pass]].{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nD'Esp\u00e8rey expected to march the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] through the towns of [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]], Rupel, Petrici, Blagusa, Gradec, [[\u0160tip]] and Belessa finally seizing Skopje. Units stationed at Katsania and [[Tetovo]] would prevent a Bulgarian [[flanking maneuver]], while the main body of the force would widen the breach both in \u0160tip and Prilep. In case of a collapse of the front between Dobro Pole and Tzena, the [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Bulgarian]] and [[11th German-Bulgarian Army|11th German]]{{refn|The 11th German Army consisted of Bulgarian soldiers commanded by German officers.{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=95}}|group=Note}} armies would either be annihilated or, in less favorable circumstances, perform an organised retreat to a new defensive line on river [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]]. The prevention of such a retreat was to be achieved by a rapid, penetrating attack on [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]], [[:mk:\u0414\u0440\u0435\u043d (\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430)|Dren Planina]] and Visoka.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=130}}\n\n==Battle==\n [[File:Nudisti\u010dka pla\u017ea na Crna.jpg|thumb|right|270px|German soldiers bathing in the [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]] river in 1918]]\nAt 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on 14 September 1918, Entente forces commenced a 566-gun artillery barrage on enemy positions. Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250-truck column moving towards [[Kozjak (Prilep)|Kozjak]]. On the same day, Scholtz sent Hindenburg a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] stating that\n\"all indications point out that an enemy offensive will target the 11th Army on both sides of Vardar as well as Dobro Pole&nbsp;...\"\nThe Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian ''[[esprit de corps]]''. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 125}}\n\nAt 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on 15 September, the French 122nd and 17th (Colonial) divisions struck Sokol, Dobro Pole, Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik. The Greek [[Archipelago Division|Archipelago]], [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th divisions]] under [[Panagiotis Gargalidis]] acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat. The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground. During the course of the battle, the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties. The left column managed to reach a position located {{convert|50|m}} from Sokol at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day. At 4:00&nbsp;p.m., the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a {{convert|200|m|adj=on}} segment of steep terrain. The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., suppressing the last signs of resistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 117, 125}}, {{harvnb|Hall|2010|p=130}}, {{harvnb|Korsun|1939|p=98}}</ref>\n\nTwo Franco-Greek regiments attempted to storm [[Voreino|Zborsko]] but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian [[Rear (military)|rear]] and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 4:00&nbsp;p.m., the Serbian [[First Army (Serbia)|1st Army]]'s thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results. An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40\u201350 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 [[prisoners of war]], 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces.

At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Franco-Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended. [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]]'s 1st Army and the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'' performed a night attack on the [[Grade\u0161nica]] fortified zone, suppressing the defenders. The 1st Division Group moved into a position on the Poroi river north of Brahovo in conjunction with  the Timok Division. By the night of 16 September, the gap in what formerly constituted the front-line had extended to {{convert|25|km}} in width and {{convert|7|km}} in depth. The Allied command ordered its air department to continue attacking all bridges on the river Vardar.{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=118\u2013119, 120\u2013122}}\n\nAt 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic components of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Grade\u0161nica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=122\u2013123}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\nOn 18 September, the 11th French Colonial Division and the 6th Greek Regiment occupied the villages of [[Zovi\u1e31]], [[Staravina]] and [[:mk:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d|Cebren]], approaching towards the [[:mk:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440|Cebren Monastery]] bridge on [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]]. An Entente [[Airstrike|air raid]] destroyed another bridge north of Razim Bey. Bulgarian forces failed at putting a stop to the Allied offensive, abandoning their wounded and large quantities of military equipment. By the end of the day, Allied troops had advanced {{convert|15|km}} into enemy territory while also seizing locales of strategic importance that would later enable them to continue pushing deeper into [[Vardar Macedonia]].{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Francuski Grobista Skopje (20).JPG|thumb|French military cemetery in Skopje]]\nImmediately following the battle, Entente forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|Battle of Doiran]] at Lake Doiran on 18 September. However, the breach of the defensive line at Dobro Pole enabled the Allies to penetrate into Vardar Macedonia and send reinforcements to Doiran. The Bulgarians rushed to the defense of their homeland, abandoning Vardar Macedonia, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. Having suffered heavy losses at Doiran, the Allied forces allowed the Bulgarians to peacefully withdraw over the border. A combination of multiple factors, including combat fatigue and poor supplies, led to the [[Radomir Rebellion]]. On 25 September, a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at [[Kyustendil]], looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight. The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of [[Radomir (town)|Radomir]] in Bulgaria, just {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the capital city of Sofia. On 27 September, the leaders of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic. About {{nowrap|4,000\u20135,000}} rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=124\u2013125}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BULGARIAN SENIOR MILITARY LEADERSHIP IN WORLD WAR I: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE BULGARIAN ARMY OPERATIONS AT DOBRO POLE AND DOIRAN IN 1918|work=MASTER OF MILITARY ART AND SCIENCE Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the [[Armistice of Salonica]] by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the [[Central Powers]]. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect, and the Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October.

The British Army neared Constantinople and, without a force capable to stopping the advance, the Ottoman government asked for an armistice (the [[Armistice of Mudros]]) on 26 October. In Serbia, \"Desperate Frankie\" (as the British nicknamed d'Esperey) continued to advance and [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|the Serbo-French Army re-captured the country]], overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near [[Ni\u0161]]. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary was forced to sign an [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|armistice]] on the Italian Front ending the war there. On 10 November, d'Esperey's army crossed the [[Danube]] river and was poised to enter the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] heartland. At the request of the French general, Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], leading the Hungarian government, came to Belgrade and signed another armistice.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=254\u2013279}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|North Macedonia|Bulgaria|Serbia|World War I}}\n* [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]\n* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Axelrod|title=How America Won World War I|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1493031924 |year=2018 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |first=Aristeidis|last=Omiridis Skylitzes|title=\u039f \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, \u03a4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u0397 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd 1918|trans-title=Hellenic Army During the First World War 1914\u20131918: Hellenic Participation in the War 1918 |volume=II |publisher=Hellenic Army History Department|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1961 |oclc= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Richard|last=Hall|title=Balkan Breakthrough: The Battle of Dobro Pole 1918|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-253-35452-5}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Fritz|last=Fischer|title=Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War|url=https://archive.org/details/germanysaimsinfi0000fisc|url-access=registration|publisher=W.W.

Since then, the program has included players such as [[Tim Howard]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Ben Olsen]], [[Sacha Kljestan]], [[Freddy Adu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]], [[Nick Rimando]], [[Kyle Beckerman]] and NFL kicker [[Josh Lambo]]. \n\nGeneration Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as [[professional]], and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the [[USL First Division|A-League]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]].\n\nIn 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.<ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/04/mls-announces-2017-generation-adidas-class-and-senior-signings</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nGeneration Adidas graduates are announced at the end of the MLS season (prior to 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usasoccer.blogspot.com/2009/09/graduating-from-generation-adidas.html|title=Graduating from Generation Adidas|publisher=USA Soccer|accessdate= 14 December 2012}}</ref> 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoriginalwinger.com/2009-11-23-mls-announces-the-graduation-of-generation-adidas-players|title=MLS Announces The Graduation Of Generation Adidas Players|publisher=The Original Winger|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/generation-adidas-players-graduate-seasons-end|title=Generation adidas players to graduate at season's end|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> and 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wvhooligan.com/2011/11/22/12582/generation-adidas-graduates-for-2011/|title=Generation Adidas Graduates For 2011|publisher=WVHooligan|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>) so in the charts below the graduation year represents the season after which the player was announced by MLS as a Generation Adidas graduate.\n\n===1997===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan \"[[city upon a hill]]\" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.\n\nWinthrop was born into a wealthy land-owning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became [[Lord of the Manor]] at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]].  He was not involved in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] began a crackdown on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the [[New World]] in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Charles River]].\n\nBetween 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative [[Thomas Dudley]] and the more liberal [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]]. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it \"the meanest and worst of all forms of government\".<ref name=Mor92/> The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.\n\nWinthrop's son [[John Winthrop the Younger|John]] was one of the founders of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.\n\n==Life in England==\nJohn Winthrop was born on January 12, 1587/8<ref name=dates>In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.

Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 107</ref> The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnWinthropJr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Winthrop's eldest son [[John Winthrop the Younger]]]]\nWinthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings.<ref name=B91/><ref>Morison, p. 59</ref> In it, he described his failures to keep \"divers vows\" and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would \"give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me\".<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 96</ref> He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that \"she proved after a right godly woman.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 97</ref> He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.<ref>Morison, p. 60</ref>\n\nHis wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time by marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on December 6, 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was \"truly religious & industrious therein\".<ref name=B103/> Thomasine died on December 8, 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.<ref name=B103>Bremer (2003), p. 103</ref>\n\nIn approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at [[Gray's Inn]].  There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 101</ref> His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of [[Great Maplestead]], [[Essex]], and he began courting [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]] in 1617, the daughter of [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] judge Sir John Tyndal and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of Puritan preacher [[Stephen Egerton (clergyman)|Stephen Egerton]]. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds;<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 112\u2013113</ref> Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue which more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on April 29, 1618 at [[Great Maplestead]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 115</ref> They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]]. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 117\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Decision to emigrate===\nIn the mid- to late-1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the [[English Reformation]] was in danger. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of [[recusant]]s and supported the [[Church of England]] in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices.<ref name=M64/> This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the [[New World]] as a viable means to escape persecution.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 138</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Endecott]] preceded Winthrop as governor in Massachusetts]]\nThe first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the [[Plymouth Colony]] on the shores of [[Cape Cod Bay]].<ref>Morison, p. 12</ref> Pastor [[John White (colonist priest)|John White]] led a short-lived effort to establish a colony at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624, also on the Massachusetts coast.<ref>Morison, pp. 28\u201329</ref> In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the [[Charles River|Charles]] and [[Merrimack River]]s. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory.<ref>Morison, pp. 31\u201334</ref>  Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by [[John Endecott]] to prepare the way for further migration.<ref>Morison, p. 35</ref> John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which primarily involved individuals from [[Lincolnshire]]; however, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans by early 1629. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company because there were many indirect connections between him and individuals associated with the company.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 153\u2013155</ref> Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son [[Henry Winthrop|Henry]] became involved in efforts to settle [[Barbados]] in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.<ref>Manegold, pp. 8\u201312</ref>\n\nIn March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning [[Personal Rule|eleven years of rule]] without Parliament.<ref name=M64>Morison, p. 64</ref> This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor [[Matthew Cradock]] proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 156</ref> It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, \"If the Lord seeth it wilbe<!--sic--> good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others\".<ref name=M64/> During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration, and he circulated a paper on August 12 providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 157\u2013158</ref> His name appears in formal connection with the company on the [[Cambridge Agreement]] signed August 26; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.<ref>Morison, p. 69</ref>\n\nThe company shareholders met on October 20 to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were [[Richard Saltonstall]] and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 161</ref> Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.<ref>Moore, p. 277</ref> Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIt was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time, and it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 162, 203</ref> To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 169</ref> Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 162</ref> By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order, although Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John, Jr. left for the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 168</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:The Coat of Arms of John Winthrop (1587-1649).gif|thumb|The coat of arms of John Winthrop]]\n\nJohn Winthrop used a [[coat of arms]] that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the [[College of Arms]], London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]. It is also the coat of arms for [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son [[Deane Winthrop]] at the [[Deane Winthrop House]].

In it, he used the now-famous phrase \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently \"the eyes of all people are upon us.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 175\u2013179</ref> He also said, \"In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection\"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient\u2014and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\">{{cite web|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WinthropLanding.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving showing Winthrop's arrival at Salem]]\nThe fleet arrived at [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June and was welcomed by John Endecott.  Winthrop and his deputy [[Thomas Dudley]] found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area.  They first decided to base the colony at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] where they founded what is now the city of [[Boston]].<ref>Mayo (1936), pp. 54\u201358</ref>  The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the [[Charles River]] in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack. These settlements became Boston, Cambridge, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Medford, and Charlestown.\n\nThe colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/><ref name=\"B103\"/>  Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony.  According to one report, he \"fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 104</ref>\n\nWinthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 205</ref>  In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the [[Mystic River]] that he called [[Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts|Ten Hills Farm]].<ref>Manegold, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's ''[[Blessing of the Bay]]''.  Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.<ref>Hart, p. 1:184</ref>\n\nThe issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.  Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there.  However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there.  This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 213</ref>  However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married.  Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], going to stake their claims.  At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers \"in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage\".<ref>Morison, p. 91</ref>  Dudley's lands became [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], and Winthrop's [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].<ref>Jones, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Colonial governance===\n[[Image:JohnWinthrop 1873 OurYoungFolks.png|thumb|right|upright|Engraving depicting Winthrop being carried across the [[Mystic River]]]]\nThe colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a [[Governor's Council]]. All these officers were to be elected annually by the [[freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] of the colony.<ref>Morison, p. 84</ref>  The first meeting of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] consisted of exactly eight men.  They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times.  The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members.<ref>Morison, p. 85</ref>  The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Morison, p. 82</ref>\n[[File:John Winthrop Home Site Charlestown.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the \"Great House\" near the corner of New Rutherford Avenue and Chelsea Avenue, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  This was the home of John Winthrop and also served as the first seat of government in the colony.]]\n\nWhen the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants.  Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen.  A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 218</ref>  In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with [[Roger Ludlow]] as deputy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 243</ref>  Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 241</ref>\n\nIn the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates.  Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them.<ref name=B305/>  His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the [[common law]] tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances.  He also pointed out that adoption of written laws \"repugnant to the laws of England\" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law.<ref name=B306>Bremer (2003), p. 306</ref>  The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was formally adopted during [[Richard Bellingham]]'s governorship in 1641.<ref name=B305>Bremer (2003), p. 305</ref>  Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.<ref>Osgood, p. 3:334</ref>\n\nIn the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because \"a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.\"<ref name=Mor92>Morison, p. 92</ref>\n\nWinthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] militia.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 361</ref>  The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants.  Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions.  Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant.  He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 362</ref>  Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 363</ref>\n\nOne major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that \"civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English\", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition.<ref>Hart, pp. 1:122\u2013123</ref>  William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.<ref>Moore, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Religious controversies===\n{{further |Calvinism}}\n[[Image:Anne Hutchinson on Trial.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[Anne Hutchinson]]'s trial, c. 1901]]\nIn 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of settlers brought first [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and then [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] to the governorship.  Haynes, Vane, [[Anne Hutchinson]], and pastors [[Thomas Hooker]] and [[John Wheelwright]] all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 281\u2013285</ref> Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more [[Legalism (theology)|Legalist]] view. This religious rift is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 285</ref>  By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 291</ref>\n\nDudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy.  First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony.<ref name=B293/>  (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]; Wheelwright founded first [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then [[Wells, Maine]] in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.)<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 299</ref><ref>Golson, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should \"make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.\"<ref name=B293>Bremer (2003), p. 293</ref> Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the [[Connecticut River]] (the nucleus of the [[Connecticut Colony]]);<ref>Moore, pp. 300\u2013302</ref> Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government.<ref>Winship, p. 9</ref> (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the [[English Civil War]]s; he was beheaded after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].)<ref>Moore, pp. 321\u2013333</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to \"refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours\".<ref name=B294>Bremer (2003), p. 294</ref> Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635.<ref name=B294/> Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of [[Providence Plantations]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 251</ref><ref>Providence Plantation later united with the settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) to create the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].</ref> Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 252</ref>\n\n===Indian policy===\nWinthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy.  He described an early meeting with one local chief:\n\n<blockquote>[[Chickatabot]] came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and [[pea]]se, and a mug, and other small things.<ref>Moore, pp. 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years,<ref>Moseley, p. 52</ref> although they also practiced a policy that historian [[Alfred A. Cave|Alfred Cave]] calls ''[[vacuum domicilium]]'': if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking.  This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise.  According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of \"more advanced\" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.<ref>Cave, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nHowever, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the [[Pequot War]] was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged.  Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on [[Block Island]] in the war's first major action.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 267</ref> Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansetts]] to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 269</ref>  The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the [[West Indies]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 271</ref>\n\n===Slavery and the slave trade===\nSlavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] arrived in the area with slaves in 1624.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves.  Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), p. 314</ref>\n\nIn 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things.  Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived.  C. S. Manegold writes that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), pp. 304, 305, 314</ref>\n\n===Trade and diplomacy===\nRising tensions in England culminated in [[English Civil War|civil war]] and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies.  The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on [[Barbados]], a source of [[cotton]], and with the neighboring French colony of [[Acadia]].<ref>Moseley, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrench Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. It was embroiled in [[Acadian Civil War|a minor civil war]] between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour]] in 1642, and his opponent [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories.  In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 343</ref>  Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.<ref name=B344>Bremer (2003), p. 344</ref>\n\nThis decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 345</ref>  John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses.<ref name=B344/>  The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 346</ref>  The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor.  In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.  Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a [[sedan chair]], originally given to him by an English privateer.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 347</ref>\n\n===Property and family===\n[[Image:FortWinthrop.png|thumb|right|The 19th century [[Fort Winthrop]], constructed on [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] and formerly owned by Winthrop]]\nIn addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner.  He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] in Boston Harbor (now the site of [[Logan International Airport]]), and [[Prudence Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]].<ref>Moore, pp. 264\u2013265</ref>  He also engaged in the [[fur trade]] in partnership with [[William Pynchon]], using the ship ''Blessing of the Bay''.<ref name=B252_3>Bremer (2003), pp. 252\u2013253</ref>  Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of [[Fort Winthrop]].<ref>Stanhope and Bacon, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nThe farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop.  The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties.  Private subscriptions to support him raised about \u00a3500 and the colony also granted his wife {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>Moore, p. 264</ref>\n\nHis wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the ''Lyon'' in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647.<ref>Anderson, p. 2039</ref><ref>Bremer (2003), p. 187</ref> Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of [[Thomas Rainsborough|Thomas]] and [[William Rainborowe]].<ref>Anderson, p. 2040</ref>  Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]] in Boston.<ref>Moore, p. 265</ref>  He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.<ref>Moore, pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\n==Writings and legacy==\nWinthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations.  His major contributions to the literary world were ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' (1630) and ''The History of New England'' (1630\u20131649, also known as ''The Journal of John Winthrop''), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.\n\n===''A Model of Christian Charity''===\n{{main|Model of Christian Charity}}\nJohn Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became ''A Model of Christian Charity'' either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route.<ref name=B174/>  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World.  He used the phrase \"city upon a hill\" (derived from the [[Bible]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]])<ref>Matthew 5:13: \"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\"</ref> to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community.<ref>Findling and Thackeray, p. 61</ref>  He encouraged the colonists to \"bear one another's burdens\" and to view themselves as a \"Company of Christ, bound together by Love.\"<ref name=Dunn11>Dunn, p. 11</ref>  He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.  If they did so, God would \"make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England.\"<ref name=Dunn11/>\n\nWinthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].<ref>See e.g. Pease, p. 76 and Hodgson, p. 1</ref>  Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].<ref name=B174>Bremer (2003), p. 174</ref>  Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs.  The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.<ref name=JW151>Jehlen and Warner, p. 151</ref>\n\n===''The History of New England''===\nWinthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the \"central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s\".<ref name=Winthropxi>Winthrop et al, p. xi</ref>  The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by [[Noah Webster]].  The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by [[James Savage (banker)|James Savage]] as ''The History of New England from 1630\u20131649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts''.  The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xii</ref>  Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.<ref>Winthrop et al</ref>\n\nThe journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing.  As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xvi</ref>  Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&source=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=GALE%7CDPZJVZ793683095&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1631007034|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life.  Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xxvii</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWinthrop's earliest publication was likely ''The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects'' (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by [[Joshua Scottow]] in the 1696 compilation ''MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England,  The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/scottow/7/|title=Massachusetts: or The First Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of Their Coming Thither, and Abode There: In Several Epistles (1696)|accessdate=2011-01-21|publisher=University of Nebraska, Lincoln}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief \"in the validity of experience\" in a private religious journal known as his ''Experiencia''.<ref name=Bremer1984>Bremer (1984)</ref>  He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the ''Journal''.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xviii</ref>  Later in his life, he wrote ''A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England'' which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644.<ref>Schweninger, pp. 47\u201366</ref> At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] had recently begun to meet.  The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings.<ref>Hall, p. 200</ref>  In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to \"tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 125</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which \"were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.\"<ref name=Bremer1984/>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:John Winthrop Tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|Winthrop's tomb in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]\nWinthrop's reference to the \"city upon a hill\" in ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse.<ref name=Bxv/>  Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times.  Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], and leading to modern assessments of him as a \"lost Founding Father\". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop \"is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses\", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.<ref>Holland, p. 2</ref>\n\nWinthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, \"evil as well as good,\" a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was \"the proper end and object of authority\", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGro|website=Biography in context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Charles|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00995.html?a=1&n=john%20winthrop&d=10&ss=1&q=5|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as [[John F.

Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan \"[[city upon a hill]]\" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.\n\nWinthrop was born into a wealthy land-owning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became [[Lord of the Manor]] at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]].  He was not involved in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] began a crackdown on [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the [[New World]] in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Charles River]].\n\nBetween 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative [[Thomas Dudley]] and the more liberal [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]]. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it \"the meanest and worst of all forms of government\".<ref name=Mor92/> The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.\n\nWinthrop's son [[John Winthrop the Younger|John]] was one of the founders of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.\n\n==Life in England==\nJohn Winthrop was born on January 12, 1587/8<ref name=dates>In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.

Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 107</ref> The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnWinthropJr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Winthrop's eldest son [[John Winthrop the Younger]]]]\nWinthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings.<ref name=B91/><ref>Morison, p. 59</ref> In it, he described his failures to keep \"divers vows\" and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would \"give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me\".<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 96</ref> He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that \"she proved after a right godly woman.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 97</ref> He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.<ref>Morison, p. 60</ref>\n\nHis wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time by marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on December 6, 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was \"truly religious & industrious therein\".<ref name=B103/> Thomasine died on December 8, 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.<ref name=B103>Bremer (2003), p. 103</ref>\n\nIn approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at [[Gray's Inn]].  There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 101</ref> His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of [[Great Maplestead]], [[Essex]], and he began courting [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]] in 1617, the daughter of [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] judge Sir John Tyndal and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of Puritan preacher [[Stephen Egerton (clergyman)|Stephen Egerton]]. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds;<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 112\u2013113</ref> Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue which more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on April 29, 1618 at [[Great Maplestead]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 115</ref> They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]]. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 117\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Decision to emigrate===\nIn the mid- to late-1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the [[English Reformation]] was in danger. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of [[recusant]]s and supported the [[Church of England]] in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices.<ref name=M64/> This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the [[New World]] as a viable means to escape persecution.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 138</ref>\n\n[[Image:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Endecott]] preceded Winthrop as governor in Massachusetts]]\nThe first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the [[Plymouth Colony]] on the shores of [[Cape Cod Bay]].<ref>Morison, p. 12</ref> Pastor [[John White (colonist priest)|John White]] led a short-lived effort to establish a colony at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624, also on the Massachusetts coast.<ref>Morison, pp. 28\u201329</ref> In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the [[Charles River|Charles]] and [[Merrimack River]]s. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory.<ref>Morison, pp. 31\u201334</ref>  Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by [[John Endecott]] to prepare the way for further migration.<ref>Morison, p. 35</ref> John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which primarily involved individuals from [[Lincolnshire]]; however, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans by early 1629. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company because there were many indirect connections between him and individuals associated with the company.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 153\u2013155</ref> Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son [[Henry Winthrop|Henry]] became involved in efforts to settle [[Barbados]] in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.<ref>Manegold, pp. 8\u201312</ref>\n\nIn March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning [[Personal Rule|eleven years of rule]] without Parliament.<ref name=M64>Morison, p. 64</ref> This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor [[Matthew Cradock]] proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 156</ref> It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, \"If the Lord seeth it wilbe<!--sic--> good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others\".<ref name=M64/> During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration, and he circulated a paper on August 12 providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 157\u2013158</ref> His name appears in formal connection with the company on the [[Cambridge Agreement]] signed August 26; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.<ref>Morison, p. 69</ref>\n\nThe company shareholders met on October 20 to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were [[Richard Saltonstall]] and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 161</ref> Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.<ref>Moore, p. 277</ref> Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIt was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time, and it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 162, 203</ref> To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 169</ref> Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 162</ref> By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order, although Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John, Jr. left for the colony.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 168</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:The Coat of Arms of John Winthrop (1587-1649).gif|thumb|The coat of arms of John Winthrop]]\n\nJohn Winthrop used a [[coat of arms]] that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the [[College of Arms]], London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]. It is also the coat of arms for [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son [[Deane Winthrop]] at the [[Deane Winthrop House]].

In it, he used the now-famous phrase \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently \"the eyes of all people are upon us.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 175\u2013179</ref> He also said, \"In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection\"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient\u2014and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\">{{cite web|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WinthropLanding.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving showing Winthrop's arrival at Salem]]\nThe fleet arrived at [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June and was welcomed by John Endecott.  Winthrop and his deputy [[Thomas Dudley]] found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area.  They first decided to base the colony at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] where they founded what is now the city of [[Boston]].<ref>Mayo (1936), pp. 54\u201358</ref>  The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the [[Charles River]] in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack. These settlements became Boston, Cambridge, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Medford, and Charlestown.\n\nThe colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/><ref name=\"B103\"/>  Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony.  According to one report, he \"fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.\"<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 104</ref>\n\nWinthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 205</ref>  In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the [[Mystic River]] that he called [[Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts|Ten Hills Farm]].<ref>Manegold, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's ''[[Blessing of the Bay]]''.  Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.<ref>Hart, p. 1:184</ref>\n\nThe issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.  Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there.  However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there.  This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 213</ref>  However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married.  Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], going to stake their claims.  At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers \"in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage\".<ref>Morison, p. 91</ref>  Dudley's lands became [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], and Winthrop's [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].<ref>Jones, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Colonial governance===\n[[Image:JohnWinthrop 1873 OurYoungFolks.png|thumb|right|upright|Engraving depicting Winthrop being carried across the [[Mystic River]]]]\nThe colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a [[Governor's Council]]. All these officers were to be elected annually by the [[freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] of the colony.<ref>Morison, p. 84</ref>  The first meeting of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] consisted of exactly eight men.  They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times.  The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members.<ref>Morison, p. 85</ref>  The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Morison, p. 82</ref>\n[[File:John Winthrop Home Site Charlestown.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the \"Great House\" near the corner of New Rutherford Avenue and Chelsea Avenue, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  This was the home of John Winthrop and also served as the first seat of government in the colony.]]\n\nWhen the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants.  Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen.  A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 218</ref>  In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with [[Roger Ludlow]] as deputy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 243</ref>  Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 241</ref>\n\nIn the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates.  Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them.<ref name=B305/>  His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the [[common law]] tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances.  He also pointed out that adoption of written laws \"repugnant to the laws of England\" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law.<ref name=B306>Bremer (2003), p. 306</ref>  The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was formally adopted during [[Richard Bellingham]]'s governorship in 1641.<ref name=B305>Bremer (2003), p. 305</ref>  Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.<ref>Osgood, p. 3:334</ref>\n\nIn the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because \"a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.\"<ref name=Mor92>Morison, p. 92</ref>\n\nWinthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] militia.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 361</ref>  The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants.  Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions.  Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant.  He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 362</ref>  Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 363</ref>\n\nOne major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that \"civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English\", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition.<ref>Hart, pp. 1:122\u2013123</ref>  William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.<ref>Moore, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Religious controversies===\n{{further |Calvinism}}\n[[Image:Anne Hutchinson on Trial.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[Anne Hutchinson]]'s trial, c. 1901]]\nIn 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of settlers brought first [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and then [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] to the governorship.  Haynes, Vane, [[Anne Hutchinson]], and pastors [[Thomas Hooker]] and [[John Wheelwright]] all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop.<ref>Bremer (2003), pp. 281\u2013285</ref> Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more [[Legalism (theology)|Legalist]] view. This religious rift is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 285</ref>  By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 291</ref>\n\nDudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy.  First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony.<ref name=B293/>  (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]; Wheelwright founded first [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then [[Wells, Maine]] in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.)<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 299</ref><ref>Golson, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should \"make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.\"<ref name=B293>Bremer (2003), p. 293</ref> Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the [[Connecticut River]] (the nucleus of the [[Connecticut Colony]]);<ref>Moore, pp. 300\u2013302</ref> Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government.<ref>Winship, p. 9</ref> (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the [[English Civil War]]s; he was beheaded after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].)<ref>Moore, pp. 321\u2013333</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to \"refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours\".<ref name=B294>Bremer (2003), p. 294</ref> Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635.<ref name=B294/> Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of [[Providence Plantations]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 251</ref><ref>Providence Plantation later united with the settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) to create the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].</ref> Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 252</ref>\n\n===Indian policy===\nWinthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy.  He described an early meeting with one local chief:\n\n<blockquote>[[Chickatabot]] came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and [[pea]]se, and a mug, and other small things.<ref>Moore, pp. 246\u2013247</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years,<ref>Moseley, p. 52</ref> although they also practiced a policy that historian [[Alfred A. Cave|Alfred Cave]] calls ''[[vacuum domicilium]]'': if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking.  This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise.  According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of \"more advanced\" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.<ref>Cave, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nHowever, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the [[Pequot War]] was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged.  Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on [[Block Island]] in the war's first major action.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 267</ref> Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansetts]] to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 269</ref>  The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the [[West Indies]].<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 271</ref>\n\n===Slavery and the slave trade===\nSlavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] arrived in the area with slaves in 1624.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves.  Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), p. 314</ref>\n\nIn 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things.  Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived.  C. S. Manegold writes that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.<ref>Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41\u201342 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), pp. 304, 305, 314</ref>\n\n===Trade and diplomacy===\nRising tensions in England culminated in [[English Civil War|civil war]] and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies.  The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on [[Barbados]], a source of [[cotton]], and with the neighboring French colony of [[Acadia]].<ref>Moseley, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrench Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. It was embroiled in [[Acadian Civil War|a minor civil war]] between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with [[Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour]] in 1642, and his opponent [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories.  In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 343</ref>  Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.<ref name=B344>Bremer (2003), p. 344</ref>\n\nThis decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 345</ref>  John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses.<ref name=B344/>  The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 346</ref>  The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor.  In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.  Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a [[sedan chair]], originally given to him by an English privateer.<ref>Bremer (2003), p. 347</ref>\n\n===Property and family===\n[[Image:FortWinthrop.png|thumb|right|The 19th century [[Fort Winthrop]], constructed on [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] and formerly owned by Winthrop]]\nIn addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner.  He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] in Boston Harbor (now the site of [[Logan International Airport]]), and [[Prudence Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]].<ref>Moore, pp. 264\u2013265</ref>  He also engaged in the [[fur trade]] in partnership with [[William Pynchon]], using the ship ''Blessing of the Bay''.<ref name=B252_3>Bremer (2003), pp. 252\u2013253</ref>  Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of [[Fort Winthrop]].<ref>Stanhope and Bacon, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nThe farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop.  The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties.  Private subscriptions to support him raised about \u00a3500 and the colony also granted his wife {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>Moore, p. 264</ref>\n\nHis wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the ''Lyon'' in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647.<ref>Anderson, p. 2039</ref><ref>Bremer (2003), p. 187</ref> Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of [[Thomas Rainsborough|Thomas]] and [[William Rainborowe]].<ref>Anderson, p. 2040</ref>  Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]] in Boston.<ref>Moore, p. 265</ref>  He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.<ref>Moore, pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\n==Writings and legacy==\nWinthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations.  His major contributions to the literary world were ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' (1630) and ''The History of New England'' (1630\u20131649, also known as ''The Journal of John Winthrop''), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.\n\n===''A Model of Christian Charity''===\n{{main|Model of Christian Charity}}\nJohn Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became ''A Model of Christian Charity'' either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route.<ref name=B174/>  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World.  He used the phrase \"city upon a hill\" (derived from the [[Bible]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]])<ref>Matthew 5:13: \"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\"</ref> to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community.<ref>Findling and Thackeray, p. 61</ref>  He encouraged the colonists to \"bear one another's burdens\" and to view themselves as a \"Company of Christ, bound together by Love.\"<ref name=Dunn11>Dunn, p. 11</ref>  He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.  If they did so, God would \"make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England.\"<ref name=Dunn11/>\n\nWinthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].<ref>See e.g. Pease, p. 76 and Hodgson, p. 1</ref>  Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].<ref name=B174>Bremer (2003), p. 174</ref>  Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs.  The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.<ref name=JW151>Jehlen and Warner, p. 151</ref>\n\n===''The History of New England''===\nWinthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the \"central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s\".<ref name=Winthropxi>Winthrop et al, p. xi</ref>  The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by [[Noah Webster]].  The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by [[James Savage (banker)|James Savage]] as ''The History of New England from 1630\u20131649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts''.  The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xii</ref>  Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.<ref>Winthrop et al</ref>\n\nThe journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing.  As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xvi</ref>  Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&source=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=GALE%7CDPZJVZ793683095&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1631007034|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life.  Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xxvii</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWinthrop's earliest publication was likely ''The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects'' (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by [[Joshua Scottow]] in the 1696 compilation ''MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England,  The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/scottow/7/|title=Massachusetts: or The First Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of Their Coming Thither, and Abode There: In Several Epistles (1696)|accessdate=2011-01-21|publisher=University of Nebraska, Lincoln}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief \"in the validity of experience\" in a private religious journal known as his ''Experiencia''.<ref name=Bremer1984>Bremer (1984)</ref>  He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the ''Journal''.<ref>Winthrop et al, p. xviii</ref>  Later in his life, he wrote ''A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England'' which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644.<ref>Schweninger, pp. 47\u201366</ref> At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] had recently begun to meet.  The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings.<ref>Hall, p. 200</ref>  In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to \"tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 125</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which \"were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.\"<ref name=Bremer1984/>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:John Winthrop Tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|Winthrop's tomb in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]\nWinthrop's reference to the \"city upon a hill\" in ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse.<ref name=Bxv/>  Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times.  Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], and leading to modern assessments of him as a \"lost Founding Father\". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop \"is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses\", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.<ref>Holland, p. 2</ref>\n\nWinthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, \"evil as well as good,\" a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was \"the proper end and object of authority\", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Reference&limiter=&u=georgetown_dhs&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGro|website=Biography in context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson.<ref name=\"Winthrop, John\"/> He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Charles|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00995.html?a=1&n=john%20winthrop&d=10&ss=1&q=5|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Michael Dukakis]], and [[Sarah Palin]].<ref name=Bxv>Bremer (2003), p. xv</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 48</ref>  Ronald Reagan described Winthrop as \"an early 'Freedom Man'\" who came to America \"looking for a home that would be free.\"<ref name=Mos7>Moseley, p. 7</ref>\n\nWinthrop is a major character in [[Catharine Maria Sedgwick]]'s 1827 novel ''[[Hope Leslie]]'', set in colonial Massachusetts.<ref>Sedgwick</ref> He also makes a brief appearance in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in the chapter entitled \"The Minister's Vigil.\"<ref>Hawthorne</ref>\n\nWinthrop's descendants number thousands today.  His son John was the first governor of the [[Saybrook Colony]], and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century.  Twentieth century descendants include former US Senator from Massachusetts and former Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], and educator [[Charles William Eliot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/governor-thomas-dudley/|title=Notable Descendants of Governor Thomas Dudley|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd}}</ref>  The towns of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], and [[Winthrop, Maine]], are named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |title=About Winthrop, Massachusetts |publisher=Town of Winthrop |accessdate=2011-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224152640/http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>Howard and Crocker, p. 2:72</ref> [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and Winthrop Hall at [[Bowdoin College]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|title=Winthrop Hall \u2013 Library \u2013 Bowdoin College|accessdate=2014-01-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113184155/http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are named in honor of him and of his descendant [[John Winthrop (educator)|John Winthrop]], who briefly served as [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|title=History of Winthrop House|publisher=Winthrop House|accessdate=2011-02-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124211331/http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe is also the namesake of squares in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[Winthrop Building]] on Water Street in Boston was built on the site of one of his homes and is one of the city's first skyscrapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BOS.2111|title=Massachusetts Cultural Resource Inventory: Winthrop Building|accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>\n\nA [[John Winthrop (Greenough)|statue of Winthrop]] by [[Richard Saltonstall Greenough|Richard Greenough]] is one of Massachusetts' two statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington D.C.]].<ref>Murdock, Myrtle Chaney, National Statuary Hall in the Nation's Capitol, Monumental Press, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1955 pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unref|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1=1.

Although she did some good things in her time, she was merciless about the unions. I'm not too happy about [[Falklands War|the Falklands]] either. We lost men, we took injuries and [[ARA General Belgrano|we blew up a ship]]. I suppose we need it for a base, but my common sense tells me that it does belong more to Argentina than it does to us. Lots of people may throw things at me for saying that about Thatcher, but hopefully not during the performance. She was a powerful figure, but she did damn all for empowering women. She didn\u2019t surround herself with any women whatsoever or encourage women to come into politics or do anything in particular. She could have been a quite wonderful role model.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/10379911.Honor_Blackman_on_her_life_story__Sean_Connery_and_living_in_Bournemouth
