In addition to Nandasiri, they have also performed with [[Walter Fernando]] (brother of the late [[baila]] singer [[M.S. Fernando]]), and female vocalist [[Malkanthi Nandasiri]], during their tours of the United States.\n\nThe success Pahan Silu has enjoyed in recent years is owed primarily to the unique sound they have introduced to Sri Lankan music.  In an era when many Sri Lankan performers (including pop-R&B duo [[Bathiya and Santhush]]) have drawn influence from urban and techno musicians in England and the United States, Pahan Silu turned, instead, to the rich, blended, harmonies of [[Africa]]n music, and the acoustic rhythms of [[Latin America]]n music.\n\nTheir first single, \"Sirip\u0101da\", a song recounting the story of a group of friends who climb to the top of [[Sri Pada|Sr\u012b P\u0101da]] (also referred to as [[Adam's Peak]]) thru its dense pre-dawn fog, debuted on March 10, 2007 on [[Asian Broadcasting Company|The Asian Broadcasting Company's]] Sri Lankan affiliate [[Hiru FM]].\n\nTheir second single, \"M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8\", a song which describes Priyan's memory of the 2000 concert given by [[Pandith Amaradeva]] in the US, debuted on December 2, 2007 simultaneously on both the [[BBC]] and [[SLBC]].\n\nIn December 2008, Pahan Silu collaborated with the Sudanese Gospel Choir to perform in a special edition of SirasaTV's \"Looks Like\" program broadcast in early 2009 which included the premier of their single \"Yala\".\n\nAmong others, founding member Priyan Weerappuli credits [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Papa Wemba]], Pandith Amaradeva, [[John Denver]], [[Clarence Wijewardane]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carlos Vives]], [[Juanes]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] as the influences behind Pahan Silu's sound.\n\n==Discography==\n'''Dayani's Theme''' (Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''Sirip\u0101da''' (S.Fernando/Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8''' (Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''Mihirak\u012b Oba''' (Kannangara/Weerappuli 2008)\n\n'''Yala''' (Weerappuli 2009)\n\n'''Gamanak Yanowa''' (Weerappuli 2011)\n\n'''Iura Dhige''' (Weerappuli/Jayasekera 2011)\n\n'''Lelena Pahan Silu''' (Weerappuli 2012)\n\n==Additional Notes==\n* The name \"''Pahan Silu''\" was given to the group by Priyan's father, and was drawn from a passage in the \"[[Guththila Kavyaya|Guttila]]\" story written by V\u00e0ethth\u00e0eve Himi - later incorporated into the song \"''Ru Rase Andhina Lese''\" by lyricist Sisira S\u00e9naratne.\n* Priyan composed the music for the song \"Siripada\" based on his memory of a hike upon Virginia's \"[[Old Rag Mountain]]\" - he has yet to visit Sri Lanka's fabled peak.\n* The song \"''M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8''\" was written by Priyan for a BBC tribute celebrating the 80th birthday of Sri Lankan artist Pandith [[W.

In addition to Nandasiri, they have also performed with [[Walter Fernando]] (brother of the late [[baila]] singer [[M.S. Fernando]]), and female vocalist [[Malkanthi Nandasiri]], during their tours of the United States.\n\nThe success Pahan Silu has enjoyed in recent years is owed primarily to the unique sound they have introduced to Sri Lankan music.  In an era when many Sri Lankan performers (including pop-R&B duo [[Bathiya and Santhush]]) have drawn influence from urban and techno musicians in England and the United States, Pahan Silu turned, instead, to the rich, blended, harmonies of [[Africa]]n music, and the acoustic rhythms of [[Latin America]]n music.\n\nTheir first single, \"Sirip\u0101da\", a song recounting the story of a group of friends who climb to the top of [[Sri Pada|Sr\u012b P\u0101da]] (also referred to as [[Adam's Peak]]) thru its dense pre-dawn fog, debuted on March 10, 2007 on [[Asian Broadcasting Company|The Asian Broadcasting Company's]] Sri Lankan affiliate [[Hiru FM]].\n\nTheir second single, \"M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8\", a song which describes Priyan's memory of the 2000 concert given by [[Pandith Amaradeva]] in the US, debuted on December 2, 2007 simultaneously on both the [[BBC]] and [[SLBC]].\n\nIn December 2008, Pahan Silu collaborated with the Sudanese Gospel Choir to perform in a special edition of SirasaTV's \"Looks Like\" program broadcast in early 2009 which included the premier of their single \"Yala\".\n\nAmong others, founding member Priyan Weerappuli credits [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Papa Wemba]], Pandith Amaradeva, [[John Denver]], [[Clarence Wijewardane]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carlos Vives]], [[Juanes]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] as the influences behind Pahan Silu's sound.\n\n==Discography==\n'''Dayani's Theme''' (Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''Sirip\u0101da''' (S.Fernando/Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8''' (Weerappuli 2007)\n\n'''Mihirak\u012b Oba''' (Kannangara/Weerappuli 2008)\n\n'''Yala''' (Weerappuli 2009)\n\n'''Gamanak Yanowa''' (Weerappuli 2011)\n\n'''Iura Dhige''' (Weerappuli/Jayasekera 2011)\n\n'''Lelena Pahan Silu''' (Weerappuli 2012)\n\n==Additional Notes==\n* The name \"''Pahan Silu''\" was given to the group by Priyan's father, and was drawn from a passage in the \"[[Guththila Kavyaya|Guttila]]\" story written by V\u00e0ethth\u00e0eve Himi - later incorporated into the song \"''Ru Rase Andhina Lese''\" by lyricist Sisira S\u00e9naratne.\n* Priyan composed the music for the song \"Siripada\" based on his memory of a hike upon Virginia's \"[[Old Rag Mountain]]\" - he has yet to visit Sri Lanka's fabled peak.\n* The song \"''M\u012bray\u00e8n \u00c8ha Thal\u00e8''\" was written by Priyan for a BBC tribute celebrating the 80th birthday of Sri Lankan artist Pandith [[W.

USciences offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in [[pharmacy]] and other health-related disciplines. USciences was established in 1821 as the '''Philadelphia College of Pharmacy''', to become the first pharmacy college in the nation.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n{{advert|section|date=December 2011}}\n}}\n[[File:University of the Sciences.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Campus entrance]]\nThe history of University of the Sciences began when 68 Philadelphia apothecaries met in [[Carpenters' Hall]] in 1821 to establish improved scientific standards and to train more competent apprentices and students. They sought to enhance their vocation, as well as protect public welfare. Nearly a year later, they organized and incorporated the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy (PCP), the first college of pharmacy in the nation. \n\nToday, the university has 52 degree-granting programs in three colleges. Its more than 2,200 students have enrolled in premier programs in the health sciences, ranging across pharmacy with its direct entry doctoral program to pre-med to physical therapy to healthcare business and health policy. Students study almost the entire range of the health sciences in one of its three colleges:\n\n* Philadelphia College of Pharmacy \u2014 North America's first school of pharmacy and the start of the University, graduates the pharmacists and scientists who deliver and discover the healthcare innovations that advance patient care.\n* Samson College of Health Sciences \u2014 educates the vital healthcare professionals who add immeasurably to the quality of life at each step\u2014from prevention to diagnosis to recovery of the patient care continuum.\n* Misher College of Arts and Sciences \u2014 provides a specialized undergraduate foundation for the sciences, with research and discovery at its core, for students seeking advanced degrees to lead in the basic and applied health sciences and serve humanity.\n\nAfter its conception in 1821, the college began to grow in enrollment, curriculum, and stature. Although matriculation was originally limited to men, the college became coeducational in 1876, and issued the first pharmacy degree to a woman in the United States, Dr. [[Susan Hayhurst]], in 1883.<ref name=Contributions>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3dZEmPUoBcC&lpg=PA10&pg=PA10 |title=American Women Pharmacists: Contributions to the Profession |last1=Henderson |first1=Metta Lou |last2=Worthen |first2=Dennis B. |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780789010926 |page=10 |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=29 November 2016 |via=Google Books}}</ref> The college initially emphasized the biological and chemical sciences as mainstays of the curriculum in pharmacy but later instituted separate curricula in three other areas: bacteriology, biology and chemistry.\n\nIn 1921, the name of the institution was changed to Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, with state authorization to grant not only the baccalaureate degree, but also the master's and doctorate in all four disciplines.\n\nAs the world of science continuously made advancements throughout the decades, the college evolved and expanded its curriculum to prepare students for the new wave of scientific breakthroughs. The college also enhanced the role of the humanities and social sciences in its science-based curricula. Primarily a commuter campus in its early days, the institution began to transform into one in which residential life and extracurricular activities played a larger role in student development.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the institution's application for university status in February 1997. In recognition of the broad spectrum of new health and science programs introduced by the institution, the college changed its name to reflect the broader range of academic opportunities offered to its students. On July 1, 1998, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science officially unveiled its new identity as University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.\n\nA brand update in 2010 refocused the University's messaging and logos. The overall name was simplified for marketing purposes to University of the Sciences in order to emphasize a national and global reach, while a new logo transitioned the USP acronym to USciences to address awareness issues. In addition, the tag line \u201cWhere science and healthcare converge\u201d was adopted to define both what the University is and what it is not.\n\nIn September 2017, the University launched a tuition reset for all students who enroll beginning in fall 2018. Undergraduate students will not pay more than $25,000 per year in tuition and general fee* for undergraduate coursework. And for those students who are accepted into one of the University's accelerated, 6-year doctoral programs in pharmacy, physical therapy, or occupational therapy, the University lowered and simplified the tuition and general fee*. The lower tuition is fixed for the student's academic career. *This pricing does NOT include room and board, health insurance, or any professional, clinical, or transportation fees.<ref>[http://www.usciences.edu/lowertuition \"The tuition equation just got easier\"], University of the Sciences website</ref>\n\n===Shaping the profession of pharmacy===\n[[William Procter, Jr.]], often described as \"the father of American pharmacy\", was a PCP professor from 1846\u20131874, as well as serving as an officer of the board. He and [[Daniel B. Smith]] were instrumental in the founding of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the national professional society of pharmacists, which was founded and organized in Philadelphia in 1852. It is now called the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the first established and largest professional association of pharmacists in the United States. The more than 50,000 members of APhA include practicing pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians and others interested in advancing the profession.\n\nIn 1868, John Maisch, PCP professor (1866\u20131893) and dean (1879\u20131893), proposed the creation of a pharmaceutical board to be appointed by the governor of each state and established the term \"registered pharmacist\". He shared his proposal with each governor and, by 1878, nine states had adopted pharmacy laws which licensed pharmacists. Every state now, of course, has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the practice of pharmacy.\n\nStarted in 1820, the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] laid down the standards for manufacturing drugs. For more than a hundred years, PCP faculty members were instrumental in its development, serving as editors throughout many editions.\n\nIn 1825, the first periodical in the United States devoted to the art and science of pharmacy, the ''American Journal of Pharmacy'', was published by PCP.\n\nPCP professors Franklin Bache and [[George Bacon Wood|George B. Wood]] compiled a comprehensive commentary on drugs, ''The Dispensatory of the United States of America''. First published in 1833, the ''Dispensatory'' was authored and edited for more than a hundred years by successive generations of faculty at the college.\n\nIn 1885, PCP professor [[Joseph P. Remington]] published ''The Practice of Pharmacy'', which soon became established as the standard text in the field. Later renamed ''Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy'', this comprehensive reference work remains widely used throughout the world. The 22nd edition was published in September 2012 jointly by [[Pharmaceutical Press]] and the University of the Sciences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usciences.edu/aboutUSP/USPhistory.shtml| title=USP History}}</ref>\n\n===Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy===\nThe Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usciences.edu/about/marvin-samson-center-for-the-history-of-pharmacy/index.html|title=Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy \u2013 University of the Sciences|work=usciences.edu|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> is an integral part of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.  The center's mission is to serve as an educational, cultural and research resource for the university, pharmacy professionals, historians and the general public through its collections of artifacts, objects and records representative of all aspects of pharmacy, including the pharmacy college's history. Through changing exhibitions, tours and programs, the center aims to deepen appreciation of the past, present and future significance of the pharmacy industry in the broader social context and in the development of American life, especially in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding region.\n\n===Campus expansion program===\nThe university doubled the size of the campus in 1998 when it acquired an adjacent, vacant industrial site. (This site was formerly the home of the original Breyers Ice Cream factory which closed its Philadelphia operation in the early 1990s.) BLT Architects designed the Athletic and Recreation Center (ARC) in August 2003. BLT Architects channeled the ambience of a traditional college campus through this building. ARC is situated between a new campus quad and a commuter parking lot. Its design features a 1,000 seat event gymnasium, recreation gymnasium, natatorium, fitness areas and a 1/10 mile indoor track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/0/12/|title=Home \u2013 BLTa|work=BLTa|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> The McNeil Science and Technology Center (McNeil STC) was officially dedicated September 2006. Additional building projects are being planned.\n\nThe McNeil Science and Technology Center houses many new classrooms, computer research rooms and teaching laboratories as well as the undergraduate and graduate programs in biology, bioinformatics/computer science and math/physics/statistics. The centerpiece of the center is a 400-seat auditorium equipped with modern audio/visual equipment.\n\nIn fall 2014, the University opened the Integrated Professional Education Complex (IPEX) and demonstrates USciences\u2019 commitment to preparing graduates for careers in the life sciences and health sciences professions. The 57,000-square-foot, three-story building showcases an integrated education model that permits students from several disciplines, including physician assistant studies, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise science, psychology and healthcare business and policy, to obtain traditional and hands-on experience. This integrated education model gives students an opportunity to fully understand its value in their everyday practice. IPEX combines innovative learning spaces and student lounge space with simulation labs, a clinical lab, mock patient exam rooms and conference rooms. It will also serve as a hub for students to study, interact and learn with and from one another. IPEX houses the provisionally accredited physician assistant studies graduate professional program. A green-roof system that emphasizes the University's commitment to the environment and sustainability, measures 20,000 square feet and will absorb nearly 15,000 gallons of water when fully saturated. IPEX earned three Green Globes from the Green Building Initiative.\n\nIn 2019, the University opened the Living & Learning Commons, a mixed-use residence hall located at 46th Street and Woodland Avenue. The 426-bed facility also includes state-of-the-art classroom, retail, living, and learning spaces and sets the standards for dynamic living and learning communities for science and healthcare students. The building features double occupancy rooms, private bathrooms, laundry amenities on each residence floor, a study lounge and study spaces on each floor, multi-use classroom spaces, and two retail spaces. An open-air plaza is a welcoming feature open to the greater USciences community and neighbors.\n\n==Academics==\nUniversity of the Sciences in Philadelphia has over 30 degree-granting programs for students from which to choose. The University is composed of three colleges: the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, Samson College of Health Sciences''',''' and Misher College of Arts & Sciences.\n\n=== Exchange agreements ===\nThe university has an exchange agreement with the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]] that allows ten students from each university to take one course a semester at the other. The university also has an agreement with the [[New York University]] Study Abroad Program that will allow University of the Sciences students to study at NYU campuses in Asia, Africa and Europe for a semester or a year.\n\n===The J. W. England Library===\nThe Library of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia was formed in 1821 at the second meeting of the Board of Trustees. Since its beginnings, the library has been considered one of the premier collections of pharmaceutical science in the country. In 1973, the library moved into its present quarters, the free-standing Joseph W. England Library. Small but specialized, the collection is particularly strong in pharmacy, pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics and foreign drug compendia. Other areas of specialization include toxicology, pharmacology and physical therapy. Contained in the Leopold Helfand Rare Book and Archives Room is a collection of seventeenth and eighteenth century botanicals, including a book once owned by Isaac Newton. Since the university and its graduates were fundamental to the building of the United States pharmaceutical industry, the university archives are of interest to anyone researching the origins of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:USciDevils.png|thumb|Official athletics logo.]]\nThe University of the Sciences (USciences) teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]].

USciences offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in [[pharmacy]] and other health-related disciplines. USciences was established in 1821 as the '''Philadelphia College of Pharmacy''', to become the first pharmacy college in the nation.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n{{advert|section|date=December 2011}}\n}}\n[[File:University of the Sciences.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Campus entrance]]\nThe history of the University of the Sciences began when 68 Philadelphia apothecaries met in [[Carpenters' Hall]] in 1821 to establish improved scientific standards and to train more competent apprentices and students. They sought to enhance their vocation, as well as protect public welfare. Nearly a year later, they organized and incorporated the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy (PCP), the first college of pharmacy in the nation. The school is sometimes colloquially called a \u201cfake school\u201d due to its lack of recognition in the collegiate world.\n\nToday, the university has 30 degree-granting programs in three colleges. Its more than 2,300 students have enrolled in premier programs in the health sciences, ranging across pharmacy with its direct entry doctoral program to pre-med to physical therapy to healthcare business and health policy. Students study almost the entire range of the health sciences in one of its three colleges:\n\n* Philadelphia College of Pharmacy \u2014 North America's first school of pharmacy and the start of the University, graduates the pharmacists and scientists who deliver and discover the healthcare innovations that advance patient care.\n* Samson College of Health Sciences \u2014 educates the vital healthcare professionals who add immeasurably to the quality of life at each step\u2014from prevention to diagnosis to recovery of the patient care continuum.\n* Misher College of Arts and Sciences \u2014 provides a specialized undergraduate foundation for the sciences, with research and discovery at its core, for students seeking advanced degrees to lead in the basic and applied health sciences and serve humanity.\n\nAfter its conception in 1821, the college began to grow in enrollment, curriculum, and stature. Although matriculation was originally limited to men, the college became coeducational in 1876, and issued the first pharmacy degree to a woman in the United States, Dr. [[Susan Hayhurst]], in 1883.<ref name=Contributions>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3dZEmPUoBcC&lpg=PA10&pg=PA10 |title=American Women Pharmacists: Contributions to the Profession |last1=Henderson |first1=Metta Lou |last2=Worthen |first2=Dennis B. |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780789010926 |page=10 |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=29 November 2016 |via=Google Books}}</ref> The college initially emphasized the biological and chemical sciences as mainstays of the curriculum in pharmacy but later instituted separate curricula in three other areas: bacteriology, biology and chemistry.\n\nIn 1921, the name of the institution was changed to Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, with state authorization to grant not only the baccalaureate degree, but also the master's and doctorate in all four disciplines.\n\nAs the world of science continuously made advancements throughout the decades, the college evolved and expanded its curriculum to prepare students for the new wave of scientific breakthroughs. The college also enhanced the role of the humanities and social sciences in its science-based curricula. Primarily a commuter campus in its early days, the institution began to transform into one in which residential life and extracurricular activities played a larger role in student development.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the institution's application for university status in February 1997. In recognition of the broad spectrum of new health and science programs introduced by the institution, the college changed its name to reflect the broader range of academic opportunities offered to its students. On July 1, 1998, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science officially unveiled its new identity as University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.\n\nA brand update in 2010 refocused the University's messaging and logos. The overall name was simplified for marketing purposes to University of the Sciences in order to emphasize a national and global reach, while a new logo transitioned the USP acronym to USciences to address awareness issues. In addition, the tag line \u201cWhere science and healthcare converge\u201d was adopted to define both what the University is and what it is not.\n\nIn September 2017, the University launched a tuition reset for all students who enroll beginning in fall 2018. Undergraduate students will not pay more than $25,000 per year in tuition and general fee* for undergraduate coursework. And for those students who are accepted into one of the University's accelerated, 6-year doctoral programs in pharmacy, physical therapy, or occupational therapy, the University lowered and simplified the tuition and general fee*. The lower tuition is fixed for the student's academic career. *This pricing does NOT include room and board, health insurance, or any professional, clinical, or transportation fees.<ref>[http://www.usciences.edu/lowertuition \"The tuition equation just got easier\"], University of the Sciences website</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, the University announced that Mayes College of Healthcare Business and Policy would be dissolved as of July 1, 2018. With that, the Department of Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Business would become a part of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usciences.edu/news/2018/usciences-announces-college-restructuring-for-2018-19.html|title=USciences Announces College Restructuring for 2018-19|website=University of the Sciences}}</ref>\n\n===Shaping the profession of pharmacy===\n[[William Procter, Jr.]], often described as \"the father of American pharmacy\", was a PCP professor from 1846\u20131874, as well as serving as an officer of the board. He and [[Daniel B. Smith]] were instrumental in the founding of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the national professional society of pharmacists, which was founded and organized in Philadelphia in 1852. It is now called the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the first established and largest professional association of pharmacists in the United States. The more than 50,000 members of APhA include practicing pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians and others interested in advancing the profession.\n\nIn 1868, John Maisch, PCP professor (1866\u20131893) and dean (1879\u20131893), proposed the creation of a pharmaceutical board to be appointed by the governor of each state and established the term \"registered pharmacist\". He shared his proposal with each governor and, by 1878, nine states had adopted pharmacy laws which licensed pharmacists. Every state now, of course, has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the practice of pharmacy.\n\nStarted in 1820, the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] laid down the standards for manufacturing drugs. For more than a hundred years, PCP faculty members were instrumental in its development, serving as editors throughout many editions.\n\nIn 1825, the first periodical in the United States devoted to the art and science of pharmacy, the ''American Journal of Pharmacy'', was published by PCP.\n\nPCP professors Franklin Bache and [[George Bacon Wood|George B. Wood]] compiled a comprehensive commentary on drugs, ''The Dispensatory of the United States of America''. First published in 1833, the ''Dispensatory'' was authored and edited for more than a hundred years by successive generations of faculty at the college.\n\nIn 1885, PCP professor [[Joseph P. Remington]] published ''The Practice of Pharmacy'', which soon became established as the standard text in the field. Later renamed ''Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy'', this comprehensive reference work remains widely used throughout the world. The 22nd edition was published in September 2012 jointly by [[Pharmaceutical Press]] and the University of the Sciences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usciences.edu/aboutUSP/USPhistory.shtml| title=USP History}}</ref>\n\n===Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy===\nThe Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usciences.edu/about/marvin-samson-center-for-the-history-of-pharmacy/index.html|title=Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy \u2013 University of the Sciences|work=usciences.edu|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> is an integral part of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.  The center's mission is to serve as an educational, cultural and research resource for the university, pharmacy professionals, historians and the general public through its collections of artifacts, objects and records representative of all aspects of pharmacy, including the pharmacy college's history. Through changing exhibitions, tours and programs, the center aims to deepen appreciation of the past, present and future significance of the pharmacy industry in the broader social context and in the development of American life, especially in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding region.\n\n===Campus expansion program===\nThe university doubled the size of the campus in 1998 when it acquired an adjacent, vacant industrial site. (This site was formerly the home of the original Breyers Ice Cream factory which closed its Philadelphia operation in the early 1990s.) BLT Architects designed the Athletic and Recreation Center (ARC) in August 2003. BLT Architects channeled the ambience of a traditional college campus through this building. ARC is situated between a new campus quad and a commuter parking lot. Its design features a 1,000 seat event gymnasium, recreation gymnasium, natatorium, fitness areas and a 1/10 mile indoor track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/0/12/|title=Home \u2013 BLTa|work=BLTa|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> The McNeil Science and Technology Center (McNeil STC) was officially dedicated September 2006. Additional building projects are being planned.\n\nThe McNeil Science and Technology Center houses many new classrooms, computer research rooms and teaching laboratories as well as the undergraduate and graduate programs in biology, bioinformatics/computer science and math/physics/statistics. The centerpiece of the center is a 400-seat auditorium equipped with modern audio/visual equipment.\n\nIn fall 2014, the University opened its newest building, the Integrated Professional Education Complex (IPEX) and demonstrates USciences\u2019 commitment to preparing graduates for careers in the life sciences and health sciences professions. The 57,000-square-foot, three-story building showcases an integrated education model that permits students from several disciplines, including physician assistant studies, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise science, psychology and healthcare business and policy, to obtain traditional and hands-on experience. This integrated education model gives students an opportunity to fully understand its value in their everyday practice. IPEX combines innovative learning spaces and student lounge space with simulation labs, a clinical lab, mock patient exam rooms and conference rooms. It will also serve as a hub for students to study, interact and learn with and from one another. IPEX houses the provisionally accredited physician assistant studies graduate professional program. A green-roof system that emphasizes the University's commitment to the environment and sustainability, measures 20,000 square feet and will absorb nearly 15,000 gallons of water when fully saturated. IPEX earned three Green Globes from the Green Building Initiative.\n\n==Academics==\nUniversity of the Sciences in Philadelphia has over 30 degree-granting programs for students from which to choose. The University is composed of three colleges: the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, Samson College of Health Sciences''',''' and Misher College of Arts & Sciences.\n\n=== Exchange agreements ===\nThe university has an exchange agreement with the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]] that allows ten students from each university to take one course a semester at the other. The university also has an agreement with the [[New York University]] Study Abroad Program that will allow University of the Sciences students to study at NYU campuses in Asia, Africa and Europe for a semester or a year.\n\n===The J. W. England Library===\nThe Library of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia was formed in 1821 at the second meeting of the Board of Trustees. Since its beginnings, the library has been considered one of the premier collections of pharmaceutical science in the country. In 1973, the library moved into its present quarters, the free-standing Joseph W. England Library. Small but specialized, the collection is particularly strong in pharmacy, pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics and foreign drug compendia. Other areas of specialization include toxicology, pharmacology and physical therapy. Contained in the Leopold Helfand Rare Book and Archives Room is a collection of seventeenth and eighteenth century botanicals, including a book once owned by Isaac Newton. Since the university and its graduates were fundamental to the building of the United States pharmaceutical industry, the university archives are of interest to anyone researching the origins of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:USciDevils.png|thumb|Official athletics logo.]]\nThe University of the Sciences (USciences) teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. The Devils are a member of the [[Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference]] (CACC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The baseball team participates in the [[Bill Giles Invitational]] tournament for Division II teams in the Philadelphia area.\n\n==Alumni==\nUniversity of the Sciences has launched the careers of many innovative and pioneering individuals in the field of health care, including the founders of six of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies:\n* Dr. [[Susan Hayhurst]]  (Class of 1883) \u2013 longtime head of the pharmaceutical department at the [[Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia]] and the first woman to receive a pharmacy degree in the United States<ref name=Contributions/>\n\n=== Major pharmaceuticals ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n* Sir [[Henry Wellcome]] (Class of 1874) \u2013 co-founder of Burroughs Wellcome and Company, which is now part of [[GlaxoSmithKline]].\n* [[Silas Mainville Burroughs (pharmacist)|Silas M.
