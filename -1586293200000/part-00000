The [[Kn\u00fdtlinga saga]] mentions as a place name \"\u00fe\u00f3rslundr\" ('Thor's Grove') in its description of Denmark (chap. 32)<ref name=\"Knytlinga saga\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Knytlinga_saga|title=Knytlinga saga (in Old Norse)|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref> and though it might refer to the island of T\u00e5singe, it could also well be referring to another place near [[Odense]]<ref name=\"Place names2\">{{cite web|url=http://danmarksstednavne.navneforskning.ku.dk/|title=Danmarks Stednavne, search T\u00e5singe (in Danish|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref>\nThe first time T\u00e5singe clearly appears in the sources is in the [[Danish Census Book]] from around 1231, where it is called '''Thosland''',<ref name=\"Place names2\"/> and this designation seems to have been in proper use for a very long time, until the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[antiquarian]]s of the day because of the rudimentary state of [[etymology]] reinterpreted the name as 'Thorseng' or 'Thorsing', believing the name to mean 'Thors seng' or 'Thors eng' (lit. [[Thor]]s bed/Thors meadow). This particular change in the island's name was seen in use for more than a century until gradually it changed into the now used form.<ref name=\"Place names2\"/>\n\nEtymologists presently consider the [[prefix]] to be a root of [[old norse]] 'Th\u014ds', meaning 'melting', 'thawing' and alike, possibly referring to the narrow strait of [[Svendborgsund]] which separates the island from [[Funen]]. The suffix '-land' is likely referring to the island itself (ref. the village name of Landet, central on the island), often used in Danish place names to characterize 'larger islands' (e.g. neighbouring [[Langeland]]).\n\n==Geography and settlements==\nT\u00e5singe is historically divided into three [[parish]]es, corresponding to the three main villages on the island, [[Bregninge, Svendborg Municipality|Bregninge]], at the northern part of the island, [[Landet]] at the central and [[Bjerreby]] at the southern part. The largest settlements besides these are [[Vindeby, Svendborg Municipality|Vindeby]], [[Troense]], [[Lundby, Svendborg Municipality|Lundby]] and [[Strammelse]].\n\nThe north and northeasternmost part of the island, comprising Vindeby and Troense, has seen a large increase in demographics since the construction of the Svendborgsund Bridge and has virtually become a suburb of Svendborg, while the rest of the island in large parts has retained its rural and historical boundaries. In the north commuters who work in the Svendborg area and retired senior citizens live, while the rest of the island is mostly occupied by farming and agriculture.\n\n[[Sydfyns Flyveplads]] (T\u00e5singe International Airport) {{airport codes||EKST}}, the only major [[aerodrome]] in the vincity, is situated on the western part of the island, providing trips for both business and recreational purposes.<ref name=\"Sydfyns Flyveplads\">{{cite web|url=http://sydfynsflyveplads.dk/|title= T\u00e5singe International Airport Homepage (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== History and attractions==\nT\u00e5singe has been a tourist destination for more than 100 years, the main attractions being the islands idyllic and surprisingly diverse nature as well as the many preserved historic buildings, often several hundreds of years old.\n\nThe island itself also had its fair share of historical events. For several decades in the 14th century, the island (along with the whole of Funen and large parts of modern [[Denmark]] in general) was pawned to [[Holstein]] nobles, but was reunited with Denmark under the Danish king [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar Atterdag]]. During the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)]] the island was overrun by Swedish troops, plundering the villages and leaving a devastated population, and still later, during the [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808\u201309]] the island was frequently used for both camp and as a transport hub for the French-Spanish reinforcements.\n\nFrom the 17th century on, during the [[Absolute monarchy|Age of absolutism]], the first [[Niels Juel|baron]] on [[Valdemars Castle]] (who had won the rights to the castle following the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]]) and his inheritors soon amassed as much land on the [[island]] as possible, effectively making the ever-sitting baron the de facto owner and [[Feudalism|feudal lord]] of almost the entire island, with the farmers remaining as [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] and copyholders, from the first part of the 18th century and right until the conversion of entailed estates into fee simple (''Lensafl\u00f8sningen'') 1919. T\u00e5singe also had its own [[Bjarkey laws|''birkeret'']], presided by the baron as supreme judicial court as well (also until 1919). The population (3,600 in 1823) was all [[peasantry]] or [[sailor]]s.<ref name=\"LundThorseng\">{{cite web|url=http://bibliotek.dk/linkme.php?rec.id=870970-basis%3A00111864|title= F. C.

Among the more well known visitors were the composer [[Rued Langgaard]] and the writer [[Henri Nathansen]].<ref name=\"T\u00e5singe \u00c5rbog 2015\">{{cite web|url=http://bibliotek.dk/linkme.php?rec.id=159003-lokalbibl%3A36804610|title=Feriefolket.

There is public access to the church in the daytime and (for a modest and optional fee) to the observation deck in the tower. The surrounding {{convert|18,000|m\u00b2|abbr=off}} of the hill is designated as a protected habitat. In the porch of the church lies a [[romanesque architecture|romanesque]] [[headstone]] placed over a [[deacon]] inscribed with [[runes]]. Situated next to the church is [[T\u00e5singe Museum]] (Museum of T\u00e5singe), which serves as a local [[folk museum]] for the historic life of mainly the [[sailor]]s of old time T\u00e5singe, but also houses in a separate building a large collection of [[Musical instrument|music instrument]]s, note sheets etc., pertaining to traditional [[folk music]].<ref name=\"BregningeKirke\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bregningekirke.dk/|title=Bregninge Kirke Hompepage (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref name=\"BregningeKirke Store Danske\">{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker_b-c/Bregninge_Kirke_-_runeindskrift|title=Bregninge Kirke on Den store danske (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref name=\"Bregninge Bakker T\u00e5singe Museum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taasinge-museum.dk/?Taasinge_Museum:Bygningerne_og_bakkerne:Bregninge_Bakker|title=Bregninge Hill and T\u00e5singe Museum (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]] a [[semaphore line]] tower, a branch of ''Storeb\u00e6ltstelegrafen'', was placed further to the north on the hill.<ref name=\"BregningeSemafor\">{{cite web|url=http://taasingearkiv.dk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1987-side-19.pdf|title= The optical telegraph on Bregninge Hill, in T\u00e5singe \u00c5rbog 1987 (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==T\u00e5singe and American emigrants==\nFrom around 1850 until the first part of the 20th century, the prospects for many young people were to become tenants or copyholders on the island like their parents, without many possibilities of ascending in life.

[[Thor]]s bed/Thors meadow). This particular change in the island's name was seen in use for more than a century until gradually it changed into the now used form.<ref name=\"Place names2\"/>\n\nEtymologists presently consider the [[prefix]] to be a root of [[old norse]] 'Th\u014ds', meaning 'melting', 'thawing' and alike, possibly referring to the narrow strait of [[Svendborgsund]] which separates the island from [[Funen]]. The suffix '-land' is likely referring to the island itself (ref. the village name of Landet, central on the island), often used in Danish place names to characterize 'larger islands' (e.g. neighbouring [[Langeland]]).\n\n==Geography and settlements==\nT\u00e5singe is historically divided into three [[parish]]es, corresponding to the three main villages on the island, [[Bregninge, Svendborg Municipality|Bregninge]], at the northern part of the island, [[Landet]] at the central and [[Bjerreby]] at the southern part. The largest settlements besides these are [[Vindeby, Svendborg Municipality|Vindeby]], [[Troense]], [[Lundby, Svendborg Municipality|Lundby]] and [[Strammelse]].\n\nThe north and northeasternmost part of the island, comprising Vindeby and Troense, has seen a large increase in demographics since the construction of the Svendborgsund Bridge and has virtually become a suburb of Svendborg, while the rest of the island in large parts has retained its rural and historical boundaries. In the north commuters who work in the Svendborg area and retired senior citizens live, while the rest of the island is mostly occupied by farming and agriculture.\n\n[[Sydfyns Flyveplads]] (T\u00e5singe International Airport) {{airport codes||EKST}}, the only major [[aerodrome]] in the vincity, is situated on the western part of the island, providing trips for both business and recreational purposes.<ref name=\"Sydfyns Flyveplads\">{{cite web|url=http://sydfynsflyveplads.dk/|title= T\u00e5singe International Airport Homepage (in Danish)|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== History and attractions==\nT\u00e5singe has been a tourist destination for more than 100 years, the main attractions being the islands idyllic and surprisingly diverse nature as well as the many preserved historic buildings, often several hundreds of years old.\n\nThe island itself also had its fair share of historical events. For several decades in the 14th century, the island (along with the whole of Funen and large parts of modern [[Denmark]] in general) was pawned to [[Holstein]] nobles, but was reunited with Denmark under the Danish king [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar Atterdag]]. During the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)]] the island was overrun by Swedish troops, plundering the villages and leaving a devastated population, and still later, during the [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808\u201309]] the island was frequently used for both camp and as a transport hub for the French-Spanish reinforcements.\n\nFrom the 17th century on, during the [[Absolute monarchy|Age of absolutism]], the first [[Niels Juel|baron]] on [[Valdemars Castle]] (who had won the rights to the castle following the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]]) and his inheritors soon amassed as much land on the [[island]] as possible, effectively making the ever-sitting baron the de facto owner and [[Feudalism|feudal lord]] of almost the entire island, with the farmers remaining as [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] and copyholders, from the first part of the 18th century and right until the conversion of entailed estates into fee simple (''Lensafl\u00f8sningen'') 1919. T\u00e5singe also had its own [[Bjarkey laws|''birkeret'']], presided by the baron as supreme judicial court as well (also until 1919). The population (3,600 in 1823) was all [[peasantry]] or [[sailor]]s.<ref name=\"LundThorseng\">{{cite web|url=http://bibliotek.dk/linkme.php?rec.id=870970-basis%3A00111864|title= F. C.

Among the more well known visitors were the composer [[Rued Langgaard]] and the writer [[Henri Nathansen]].<ref name=\"T\u00e5singe \u00c5rbog 2015\">{{cite web|url=http://bibliotek.dk/linkme.php?rec.id=159003-lokalbibl%3A36804610|title=Feriefolket.

There is public access to the church in the daytime and (for a modest and optional fee) to the observation deck in the tower. The surrounding {{convert|18,000|m\u00b2|abbr=off}} of the hill is designated as a protected habitat.

In the original game, Zack is a late member of the [[paramilitary]] organization [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Departments|SOLDIER]], the military wing of the [[megacorporation]] [[Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]]. Zack ultimately died in the weeks leading up to the opening of the game protecting Cloud from Shinra's army after they had escaped from imprisonment and being the subjects of genetic experimentation.\n\nDuring the [[metaseries]] ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', Zack is revealed to have been [[Aerith Gainsborough]]'s first boyfriend, as well as a friend of [[Cloud Strife]], the game's protagonist. He is the second owner of the {{Nihongo|Buster Sword|\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9|Basut\u0101 S\u014ddo}}, and wielded it before Cloud, giving it to him as he died. Zack also appears in the ''Compilation'' titles ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' and, most significantly, ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', a prequel in which he is the protagonist.\n\nZack Fair was originally not a part of ''Final Fantasy VII''. However, scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] wanted to bring a sense of mystery to the title, and created the character to help complicate Cloud's backstory. He was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and his name derived from \"fair weather,\" to contrast with Cloud Strife's name. With Zack's conceptual backstory in place for ''Final Fantasy VII'', the staff decided to use ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' to expand upon his character. Zack is voiced by [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in Japanese and [[Rick Gomez]] in English. Suzumura was chosen specifically by Nomura for his voice, and was given the role without an audition. Western critics have praised Zack's character, commenting on his development since ''Final Fantasy VII''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nZack did not exist in the original scenario of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', but was created only when scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background.<ref name=\"10thinter\"/> Nojima had always planned for [[Cloud Strife]]'s memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and [[Aerith Gainsborough]], as Aerith had seen something of Zack in Cloud. Zack was the first person Aerith loved, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first love was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]].

During the game, Zack is revealed to have been [[Aerith Gainsborough]]'s first boyfriend, as well as a friend of [[Cloud Strife]], the game's protagonist. Zack ultimately died in the weeks leading up to the opening of the game protecting Cloud from Shinra's army after they had escaped from imprisonment and being the subjects of genetic experimentation. He is the second owner of the {{Nihongo|Buster Sword|\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9|Basut\u0101 S\u014ddo}}, and wielded it before Cloud, giving it to him as he died. Zack also appears in the ''Compilation'' titles ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' and, most significantly, ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', a prequel in which he is the [[protagonist]].\n\nZack Fair was originally not a part of ''Final Fantasy VII''. However, scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] wanted to bring a sense of mystery to the title, and created the character to help complicate Cloud's backstory. He was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and his name derived from \"fair weather,\" to contrast with Cloud Strife's name. With Zack's conceptual backstory in place for ''Final Fantasy VII'', the staff decided to use ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' to expand upon his character. Zack is voiced by [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in Japanese and [[Rick Gomez]] in English. Suzumura was chosen specifically by Nomura for his voice, and was given the role without an audition. Western critics have praised Zack's character, commenting on his development since ''Final Fantasy VII''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nZack did not exist in the original scenario of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', but was created only when scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background.<ref name=\"10thinter\"/> Nojima had always planned for [[Cloud Strife]]'s memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and [[Aerith Gainsborough]], as Aerith had seen something of Zack in Cloud. Zack was the first person Aerith loved, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first love was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. As the game continued in its development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some of the scenes in the game needing revision. Director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] was surprised by the revelation of Cloud's and Zack's connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] got the request to design Zack when ''Final Fantasy VII'' was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes so as to give clues about him, despite the fact that he did not reveal to the staff Zack's existence until later.<ref name=\"10thinter\">{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix |pages=8\u201313}}</ref>\n\nZack appears as a young man with spiky black hair, standing 185&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;ft 1 in) tall.<ref name=\"Zack'sprofile\"/> He wears the [[SOLDIER]] 1st class uniform, consisting of a black, sleeveless [[Polo neck|turtleneck]], black boots, and armor.
