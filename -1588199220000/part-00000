These customers-turned-salespeople register online as a \"coach\" and sell fitness packages using Beachbody products and programs including workout DVDs, food supplements and meal plans and in turn earning up to 25% commission,but in reality they just lose big amounts of money.\nThe scamming company thrives of the people who are currently unemployed, trying to make some sort of income. They promise them unrealistic things, luring them into the scheme. In reality, as any other pyramid scheme, the people on top make money from everybody who signs up and actual sales do not matter at all. The so called \"coaches\" are being predatory, pushing and harassing everybody they could. They often do instagram live videos, assaulting and putting down everybody who does not believe in their ways, calling them a variety of names such as \"lazy\". As a result of that, they hope that percent of the people who have been put down would reach to them seeking a better future and business opportunities. These coaches often encourage people to invest even the last penny in their pocket, without any remorse, knowing very good how bad this would turn for their victims.\n\n==P90X==\n{{Infobox product\n| title            = P90X\n| image            =[[Image:P90X system.jpg|200px]]\n| caption          = P90X Materials\n| inventor         = [[Tony Horton (personal trainer)|Tony Horton]]\n| launch year      = 2003\n| company          =\n| available        = \n| current supplier = [[Beachbody]]\n| last production  =\n| notes            =\n}}\n[[Image:p90xgym.jpg|thumb|right|Standard home gym equipment recommended for use with P90X: Yoga blocks, yoga mat, dumbbells, pull-up/chin-up bar, push-up handles, gloves, and chair]]\n\n'''P90X''', or Power 90 Extreme, is a commercial home exercise regimen created by [[Tony Horton (personal trainer)|Tony Horton]] in 2005 and was developed as a successor to the program called \"Power 90\".
