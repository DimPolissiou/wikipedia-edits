The contestant from [[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)#One Bid|Contestants' Row]] who bids closest to the price of a prize without going over wins the prize and has the chance to win additional prizes or cash in an onstage game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated. Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode. Prior to expanding to one hour in length, three games per episode were played during the half-hour format. With the exception of a single game from early in the show's history, only one contestant at a time is involved in a pricing game.\n\nA total of 110 pricing games have been played on the show, 77 of which are in the current rotation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listing of currently-played games on official website for The Price is Right|url=http://www.priceisright.com/games/|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref> On a typical hour-long episode, two games\u2014one in each half of the show\u2014will be played for a car, at most one game will be played for a cash prize and the other games will offer merchandise or trips. Usually, one of the six games will involve grocery products, while another will involve smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.\n\nSome rules of pricing games have been modified over the years due to the effects of [[inflation]].

The contestant wins both prizes by choosing the one that has been marked down farther from retail.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bargain Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bargain-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game was known as ''Barker's Bargain Bar'', named for previous host [[Bob Barker]], until it was removed from rotation on December 5, 2008.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The game returned on April 10, 2012{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} after a hiatus and was renamed ''Bargain Game'', with a new set.\n\n====Bonkers====\nA gameboard displays an incorrect four-digit price for a prize and contains eight spaces: one space above and one space below each digit. The contestant is given four markers to place on the board and has 30 seconds to determine whether each correct digit in the price of the prize is higher or lower than the digit displayed, placing a marker above or below the incorrect digit to denote their choice. The contestant then presses a button. If the guessed pattern is correct, the contestant wins the prize. If the guess is incorrect, a buzzer sounds and the contestant must try again, not knowing how many digits are wrong or which ones. Changes can be made until the contestant finds the right pattern or until time has expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonkers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bonkers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Bonus Game====\nThe contestant is asked whether each of four small prizes is priced higher or lower than the incorrect price given. Each prize corresponds to one of four windows on a gameboard, one of which conceals the word \"Bonus\", and each correct guess wins the small prize and control of the window. The contestant wins a large bonus prize by correctly pricing the small prize with the window containing the word \"Bonus\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonus Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bonus-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Bullseye====\nFive grocery items are shown, and the contestant is asked to purchase a quantity of a single item such that the total price is between $10 and $12. The contestant may make three attempts, each with a different item, and immediately wins the game by succeeding on any one attempt. If the total for an item is between $2 and $10, the host places a marker on a target-shaped gameboard to indicate it. If the total is less than $2 or over $12, no marker is placed.\n\nOne item has a bullseye hidden behind its price tag. If the contestant fails to reach the $10\u2013$12 range on all three attempts, he/she can still win if the hidden bullseye is behind the price tag of an item for which he/she earned a marker on the target.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bullseye|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bullseye|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the target featured a $5 to $10 range, with $9 to $10 as the bullseye range. Shortly thereafter, the target became $1 to $6, with a $5 to $6 bullseye range.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===C===\n\n====Card Game====\nThe contestant uses [[playing cards]] from a standard deck to bid on a car. Before playing the game, the contestant draws a card from another deck to determine how close their bid must be to the actual price, without going over, in order to win. The contestant's bid starts at $15,000 and increases as the contestant draws cards: face cards add $1,000 and numbered cards add their face value multiplied by $100. Aces are wild and can either be played immediately or held aside. When the contestant chooses to stop drawing cards, the price of the car is revealed. If the bid is within the target range without going over, the contestant wins the car.<ref>{{cite web|title=Card Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=card-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game debuted, no starting bid was given and aces could be made any value up to $1,000. The starting bid increased several times as a result of [[inflation]] to speed up the game: to $2,000 in 1983; $8,000 in 1993; $10,000 in 2001; $12,000 in 2005; and $15,000 in 2008. A rule change added in 2014 allows the game to be played for a luxury car, with the starting bid set at $60,000. Additionally, beginning in 1983 (coinciding with the addition of a starting bid), aces can be made any positive value the contestant chooses.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe special deck has also changed several times. When the game debuted, the deck consisted of nine cards with one each of values from $200 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1983, when the game became ''The New Card Game'', the deck consisted of twelve cards with two each of values from $500 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1993, the deck changed again to a deck of twelve cards with three each of values from $500 to $2,000 in $500 increments. In 2005, the deck changed to seven cards, with two each of $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000 values, and one $5,000 card.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Check Game====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and asked to write an amount on an oversized blank check made out in his or her name. The value of the prize is then added to the amount written on the check and if the total falls between $8,000 and $9,000, the contestant wins both the prize and the cash amount of the check. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant receives the check as a souvenir. If he or she loses, the check is first voided with a rubber stamp.<ref>{{cite web|title=Check Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=check-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game was originally titled ''Blank Check'' and had a winning range of $3,000 to $3,500. It was renamed \"Check Game\" in 1986 and the range fell between $5,000 and $6,000 by 1989 and between $7,000 and $8,000 by 2008. The current range went into effect in 2019.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}##\n\n====Check-Out====\nThe contestant is asked to individually price five grocery items. After all five guesses are tallied, the actual prices of the items are revealed. If the contestant's cumulative total is within $2.00 of the actual total price of the five grocery items high or low, the contestant wins a bonus prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Check-Out|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=check-out|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game began, the range was 50 cents, then raised to $1 in April 1996, before being raised to the current $2 range in October 2003.##\n\n====Cliff Hangers====\nThe contestant faces a gameboard consisting of a mountain slope divided into 25 steps, with a figure of a climber at its base and a cliff at the top. He/she must guess the retail prices of three small prizes, one at a time. The climber moves one step up the slope for every dollar the contestant is off, high or low, and the correct price is not revealed until after the climber has either stopped or fallen off the cliff. If the total of the contestant's errors on all three guesses is no more than $25, he/she wins the three small prizes and a larger prize. If the climber falls off the cliff, the game ends and the contestant wins only the small prizes he/she had priced before the fall occurred.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cliff Hangers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=cliff-hangers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOfficially, the mountain climber has no name, although several hosts have used their own names for him. [[Doug Davidson]] referred to the climber on ''[[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'' as Hans Gudegast, which is the birth name of his ''[[The Young and the Restless|Young and the Restless]]'' co-star [[Eric Braeden]]. [[Drew Carey]] has referred to him as Hans, Yodel Man and most frequently, Yodely Guy. Carey has also referred to this game as \"the Yodely Guy game\". At ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]'', he is often referred to as Johann. [[Dennis James]] referred to the climber as Fritz. On an episode which taped in 1976, after the climber fell off the cliff, James commented, \"There goes Fritz!\", unaware that [[Janice Pennington]]'s then-husband, Fritz Stammberger, had recently disappeared in what had been reported to be a mountain climbing accident at the time. James' offhand comment upset Pennington so much that she remained backstage crying for the rest of the episode.{{sfn|Blits|2007|page=61}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/husbandloverspyt00penn|last1=Pennington|first1=Janice|first2=Carlos|last2=de Abreu|title=Husband, Lover, Spy: A True Story|publisher=Custos Morum Publishers|location=[[Beverly Hills, California]]|year=1994|isbn=978-1884025037|url-access=registration}}</ref>##\n\n====Clock Game====\nThe game is played for three prizes. The actual price of the first prize is shown to the studio and home audiences. After the contestant gives their first bid, a 30-second clock is started and the host tells the contestant whether the actual price is higher or lower than the bid. The contestant continues to bid, responding to the host's clues, until either the contestant wins by correctly guessing the price of the prize or the time expires. If time remains after the first prize is won, the process is repeated for the second prize. If the contestant prices both prizes within 30 seconds, he or she also wins the third prize as a bonus. Unlike other pricing games, the audience is required to remain silent while the contestant is making his or her bids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clock Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=clock-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith few exceptions, the prizes which contestants must price have almost exclusively been valued below $1,000. Prior to the addition of a bonus prize, prizes priced above $1,000 were offered during the game for a brief period from 2008 to 2009. Prizes valued over $1,000 were also offered for a brief period in the 1980s. The contestant was given only the thousands digit in the price and was required to guess the remaining digits in the price.\n\nFrom 1998\u20132014, contestants were awarded a bonus of $1,000 for winning both prizes within 30 seconds.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Coming or Going====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and the numbers in a four-digit price, which are displayed on a shelf.  The shelf can be tilted in two directions (\"coming\" or \"going\"), producing two possible prices, one being the reverse of the other. In order to win the prize the contestant must tilt the shelf in the right direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coming or Going|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=coming-or-going|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Cover Up====\nFive spaces are shown on a gameboard. Above each space are numbers: two above the first space, three above the second space and so on up to six above the fifth space. The contestant is asked to choose a number in each column to create a price for a car. Any correct digits are then lit; the contestant immediately wins the car for having all five correct, or loses for having all of them incorrect. If some of the digits are correct, the contestant covers each incorrect digit with a new choice from its column. The game continues until the contestant either wins by getting all five digits correct, or loses by providing a price in which no new digits are correct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cover Up|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=cover-up|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it does not affect gameplay, until May 23, 2013,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} a false price was initially placed at the start of the game, and the contestant was required to cover up the incorrect digits during his or her first turn. Since June 4, 2013, the false price has been replaced by various items such as certain symbols, the numbers on the false price being turned upside down, humorously altered photos of staff or special themes relating with the episode.\n\n===D===\n\n====Danger Price====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and a \"danger price\", which is the price of one of the prizes. In order to win the game and all four prizes, the contestant must select the three prizes that do not have the same value as the danger price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danger Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=danger-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Dice Game====\nThe game is played for a car with a price that only contains the digits one through six. The first digit of the price is revealed, and the contestant rolls four dice on a gaming table, one at a time. The table has a line painted across its width near the end opposite the contestant, and a die must land entirely across the line in order to count. Each die corresponds to one of the remaining digits in the price. If the contestant rolls the actual digit, it is revealed on a gameboard. Otherwise, he or she must guess whether the correct digit is higher or lower than the one rolled. Any incorrect roll of one or six is defaulted to \"higher\" or \"lower\". The contestant wins the car by guessing correctly on all digits that he or she has not rolled exactly, or by rolling all four digits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dice Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=dice-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1977, the car price occasionally included zeroes or digits higher than six. Until 2007, the contestant was required to state \"higher\" for rolls of one and \"lower\" for rolls of six. Originally, when cars with four-digit prices were offered, the first number was not revealed to start the game. When cars priced above $10,000 were first offered in the 1980s, an extra digit readout was added to the left side of the gameboard for the first number in the price. The game was briefly renamed ''Deluxe Dice Game'' when this change first occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Do the Math====\nA contestant is shown two prizes and the difference in their prices, typically an amount between $800 and $1,200.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do the Math|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=do-the-math|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=6 October 2014| quote=The difference between two prices is $802.|number=6831K}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=10 November 2014| quote=The difference between two prices is $1,129.|number=6891K}}</ref> The contestant must decide whether that amount must be added to or subtracted from the price of the prize on the left to yield the price of the one on the right.

Each row corresponds to one of two prizes and contains a bar that highlights four consecutive digits. Whenever either bar is moved, the other one moves in the same way. The contestant wins both prizes by positioning the bars to highlight the correct prices, reading from upper left to lower right for one and lower left to upper right for the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Cross|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=double-cross|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Double Prices====\nThe contestant is shown two possible prices for a prize, one of which is correct. The contestant wins the prize if he or she chooses the correct price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Prices|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=double-prices|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwo prizes were offered in early episodes of the 1970s syndicated edition hosted by [[Dennis James]]. Regardless of whether or not the contestant won the first prize, the contestant could win a second prize by choosing the correct price from a different set of two possibilities.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===E===\n\n====Easy as 1 2 3 {{anchor|Easy as 1 2 3}}====\nThe contestant is given three blocks marked \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\", which are used to rank three prizes from least expensive to most expensive. The contestant wins everything by correctly ranking all three items.<ref>{{cite web|title=Easy as 1 2 3|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=easy-as-1-2-3|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===F===\n\n====Five Price Tags====\nThe contestant is briefly shown five price tags, one of which is the correct price of a car. Four small prizes are then presented; for each one, the contestant must guess whether its displayed price is \"true\" (correct) or \"false\" (incorrect). Each correct guess wins that prize and one choice from the five price tags. After playing through all four prizes, the tags are brought out again and the contestant wins the car by selecting the correct price before running out of choices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Price Tags|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=five-price-tags|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> If the contestant guesses all four small prizes incorrectly, the game ends.\n\n====Flip Flop====\nA gameboard displays four digits in the price of a prize arranged in pairs (e.g., 12|34) on two panels. At least one of the pairs of digits needs to be reversed. The contestant may \"flip\" the first pair ($'''2,1'''34), \"flop\" the second pair ($1,2'''43'''), or \"flip flop\" both pairs ($'''2,143'''). The contestant wins the prize by making the correct choice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flip Flop|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=flip-flop|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Freeze Frame====\nA ring of eight tiles, each with a two-digit number, rotates clockwise through a frame at the top of a gameboard. Two of the tiles appear in the frame at a time, forming a four-digit price. The contestant pulls a lever to stop the ring from moving when he or she believes the price within the frame is the price of the prize. If the contestant guesses the price correctly, he or she wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freeze Frame|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=freeze-frame|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===G===\n\n====Gas Money====\nThe contestant is shown five prices for a car. One at a time, the contestant selects the four prices he or she believes to be incorrect. Each successful choice wins one of four different cash amounts hidden behind the prices ($1,000, $2,000, $3,000, or $4,000). After each guess, the contestant may choose to either stop and keep any cash won, or risk what has already been won by selecting another price. If the contestant successfully guesses all four incorrect prices, he or she wins the car and $10,000. If the contestant guesses the correct price at any time, the game ends and the contestant loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gas Money|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=gas-money|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to June 19, 2009,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} contestants had to select what they believed to be the actual price of the car before attempting to eliminate the other four incorrect prices.\n\n====Golden Road====\nThree prizes are presented, the first and second of which have three- and four-digit prices. The final prize is often billed as one of \"the most expensive single prizes offered on the show\", with a price consisting of five (or occasionally six) digits. Since 2008, the final prize is usually a premium European sports or luxury car, although premium American sports cars are also offered, especially for patriotically-themed episodes. The hundreds digit is missing from the price of each prize, and the digits in the prices of the first two prizes do not repeat.\n\nThe contestant is shown the price of a grocery item worth less than $1 and is then asked which of the two unique digits in its price belongs in the price of the first prize. If correct, the three digits in that price are used to select the missing digit for the second prize. If the contestant prices the second prize correctly, the four numbers in its price are used to select the missing digit for the final prize. If the contestant makes an incorrect choice at any time, the game ends but he or she wins any correctly priced prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Road|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=golden-road|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Grand Game====\nThe contestant is shown a target price and six grocery items, four of which are priced below the target price. One at a time, the contestant selects items he believes are priced lower than the target. The contestant's winnings start at $1 and are multiplied by ten for each correct selection, to $10, $100 and $1,000. A contestant who makes an incorrect guess prior to reaching the $1,000 level keeps whatever money is accumulated to that point. After reaching the $1,000 level, the contestant may choose to quit the game and keep his or her winnings or to risk that money in order to attempt to select the one remaining product priced lower than the target. A correct final choice wins the maximum of $10,000. However, if the final item the contestant selects is one of the two above the target price, the contestant loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=grand-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Gridlock! {{anchor|Gridlock}}====\nThe contestant is shown a row of seven model cars, the leftmost of which displays the first digit in the actual price of a car. The remaining six (three blue, followed by three red) each display a pair of digits. The contestant selects the blue car that he/she believes shows the second and third digits in the actual price. If the choice is correct, the contestant then tries to select the correct last two digits from among the red cars. The contestant wins the car by completing its price. Selecting one incorrect pair of digits allows the contestant to choose again from the remaining two cars in that group, but a second mistake ends the game.\n\n====Grocery Game====\nThe contestant is shown five grocery items and asked to purchase quantities of them to total between $20 and $22. The contestant can purchase any quantity of any item, but may not use any item more than once. After the contestant selects an item, its price is revealed and multiplied by the quantity, then added to the contestant's running total on a cash register. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins a prize. The game is lost if the contestant's total exceeds $22 or he or she exhausts all five items before reaching $20.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grocery Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=grocery-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1989, the original total range was $6.75 to $7. From 1989 through 2016,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=6 October 2016 |season=45 |number=14 |language=English}}</ref> the winning range was $20 to $21. The first four times the game was played, the contestant received $100 at the start of the game, which he or she kept if he or she won, chose to stop before exceeding $7, or lost without exceeding $7. The contestant also received supplies of the five items in each of those four games. The quantities varied but always totaled at least $100 and counted toward the contestant's winnings.\n\n===H===\n\n===={{1/2}} Off {{anchor|Half Off}}====\nA $10,000 cash prize is hidden in one of 16 boxes. The contestant is presented with three pairs of small prizes. Within each pair, one prize is correctly priced and the other has had its price cut in half. Each time the contestant selects a half-price prize, he or she wins that pair of prizes and half of the remaining boxes are eliminated, leaving the winning box still in play. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to select that box and win the $10,000. Guessing correctly on all three pairs awards a $1,000 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome.<ref>{{cite web|title=1/2 Off|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=half-off|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the episode which aired October 19, 2007,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=19 October 2007|season=36 |number=4055K}}</ref> the rules were modified to award the contestant $500 in addition to the two smaller prizes for each pair correctly priced, for a total of $1,500. Beginning September 28, 2010,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=28 September 2010 |season=36 |number=5242K}}</ref> the $500 per-pair bonus was removed. Instead, contestants now win a $1,000 bonus for correctly pricing all three pairs of items. Under both formats, the contestant keeps the bonus money even if he or she does not win the grand prize.\n\n====Hi Lo====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose the three with the highest prices in order to win. These items' prices are placed in the \"Hi\" row of the gameboard, and the lowest price in that row is kept and the others discarded before the other three items' prices are revealed and placed in the \"Lo\" row. The contestant wins if all three of the prices are lower than the remaining \"Hi\" price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hi Lo|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=hi-lo|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game's history, the contestant was asked whether each individual item's price belonged in the \"Hi\" row or the \"Lo\" row. The contestant either won the game by correctly placing each of the six prices or lost by making a mistake.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Hole in One (or Two) {{anchor|Hole in One}}====\nThe contestant must putt a golf ball into a hole (similar to [[miniature golf]]) in order to win a car. The putting green has six white lines painted across its width, and the contestant begins at the one farthest from the hole. He or she is asked to put six grocery items in ascending order of price. For every successive price that is higher than the one before it, the contestant moves one line closer to the hole. Correctly ordering all six items awards a $500 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome. If the contestant misses the putt, the host reveals the full name of the game as \"Hole in One or Two\" and he or she is given a second chance to make the putt from the same line.\n\nPrior to the contestant's first attempt, the host usually takes an \"inspiration putt\" from the farthest line to demonstrate the use of the putter, although a model or golf-involved guest will occasionally perform this instead.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hole in One (or Two)|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=hole-in-one|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUntil October 10, 1986,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the contestant was allowed only one putt to win the car. The game's name became ''Hole in One or Two'' when the second-putt rule was instituted. \n\n====Hot Seat{{anchor|Hot Seat}}====\nFive small prizes are displayed onstage, arranged on a row of pedestals, and the contestant sits in a chair that moves automatically from one to the next. As the contestant reaches each prize, an incorrect price is revealed and he/she must press one of two buttons to guess whether the true price is higher or lower. The contestant has 35 seconds to make all five guesses. If time runs out, any prizes the contestant has not reached are taken out of play.\n\nThe contestant is told that all of his/her correct guesses will be revealed first, and the chair moves to one of the five prizes. If the contestant's guess on this prize is correct, he/she wins the prize and $500. Successive correct guesses increase the winnings to $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, and finally $20,000. After the chair has moved to the next item, the contestant may choose to stop before the price is revealed and keep all money won to that point, but if an incorrect guess is revealed, the game ends, and the contestant loses everything; however, they keep any small prizes won to that point.\n\n===I===\n\n====It's in the Bag====\nThe contestant is shown a series of five grocery bags, with a price tag on each one indicating the retail price of a grocery item in the bag. Six grocery items are then shown: five of the six items correspond to the items in the bags, while the sixth item does not match any of the displayed prices. One at a time, the contestant must match up the grocery items with their prices. After all five choices have been made, the host reveals the price of each item. If the item in the bag matches the one the contestant chose, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and must decide whether or not to continue to the next level or quit with the money he or she has already won. If the contestant chooses to continue and an incorrect match is revealed, the game ends and he or she loses everything. The first correct match wins $1,000, and each successive correct match doubles the contestant's winnings ($2,000, $4,000, $8,000 and $16,000).<ref>{{cite web|title=It's in the Bag|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=its-in-the-bag|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===L===\n\n====Let 'em Roll====\nThis game, loosely based on the dice game [[yacht (dice game)|yacht]], is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $7,500. It uses five large dice, each marked with an image of a car on three sides and cash values of $500, $1,000 and $1,500 on the other three. The contestant is given one roll of the dice and can earn up to two more using three grocery products. The price of the first item is given, and the contestant must determine whether the price of each of the next two items is higher or lower than the one preceding it.\n\nIn order to win the car, the contestant must roll a car on all five dice within their allotted number of rolls. All dice that display cars are taken out of play after each roll. At any point, the contestant can elect to take the sum of the cash values on the remaining dice and quit; contestants who use all of their rolls without winning the car automatically receive the total of the displayed values on their final roll.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let 'em Roll|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=let-em-roll|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Line 'em Up====\nLine 'em Up is played for a car and three other prizes. The contestant is shown the first and last digits of the car's price. Two of the smaller prizes each have a three-digit price and one has a two-digit price. In order to win the car and the prizes, the contestant must line up the three prices in a frame to display a price for the car. If the guess is correct, the contestant wins everything. Otherwise, the contestant is told how many of the digits are correctly placed\u2014but not specifically which ones\u2014and the contestant then makes a second guess. The contestant wins nothing if he or she guesses incorrectly on the second attempt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Line 'em Up|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=line-em-up|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Lucky Seven {{anchor|Lucky $even}}====\nThe contestant is given seven $1 bills and shown the first digit in the price of a car. The contestant guesses the remaining digits in the price, one at a time, losing $1 for each digit of difference between their guess and the correct digit. If the contestant has at least $1 remaining after all digits are played, he or she wins the car (using $1 to buy it), plus any additional money not used in the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucky $even|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=lucky-seven|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, all cars appearing in this game were priced under $10,000 and no free digits were revealed. When cars priced above $10,000 began to regularly appear, the free digit rule varied: on six special episodes which aired in prime time during the summer of 1986, the last digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game and the contestant had to guess the first four digits. Later that year on the daytime show, the contestant was offered the first digit and was required to guess the last four digits in the price.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nOn November 5, 2009,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} to celebrate the show's 7,000th episode, the game used seven stacks of $1,000 instead of the usual seven $1 bills. During that episode, the contestant needed at least $1,000 to buy the car, and kept any remaining money if he or she won the car.\n\n===M===\n\n====Magic #====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes and told which one has the higher price. He or she then pulls a lever to adjust a \"magic number\" on a display so that it falls between the two prices. The contestant wins both prizes by setting the number correctly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic #|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=magic-#|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Make Your Move====\nThe contestant is shown a sequence of nine digits on a gameboard which include, consecutively but in unknown order, the prices of three prizes: one of each with a two-, three- and four-digit price. Three sliding markers are set underneath the digits, one for each prize. In order to win everything, the contestant must correctly position the markers under the corresponding prices, using each digit once without overlapping.<ref>{{cite web|title=Make Your Move|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=make-your-move|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor a brief time in October 1990, a second prize with a three-digit price replaced the prize with a two-digit price. Under these rules, one of the numbers on the board appeared in the price of two prizes, requiring the sliders to overlap.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Master Key====\nA car and two additional prizes are each represented by a giant lock. The contestant is shown two small prizes, each displaying a string of three digits, and must decide whether the first two or last two digits make up the correct price. For example, a prize showing \"357\" has a price of either $35 or $57. Each time the contestant chooses a correct price, he or she wins that prize and selects one key from a rack of five. Three of the keys correspond to one prize lock each, one will open none of the locks, and one (the \"Master Key\") opens all three. If the contestant earns any keys, he or she tries them in the locks and wins any prizes he or she is able to unlock. If a key opens the first lock (or the second one if the first has already been opened), the contestant is then directed to try it in the third lock to see if it is the Master Key.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master Key|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=master-key|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Money Game====\nThe contestant is shown a board of nine two-digit numbers, two of which are the first and last two digits in the price of a car. The middle digit is revealed at the outset, and the contestant chooses one number at a time. The correct numbers hide the front and rear halves of the car, while all others hide dollar signs. Any incorrect numbers chosen by the contestant are placed into a column of four blank spaces and awarded as cash. If the contestant completes the price before filling the column, he/she wins both the car and the sum of the incorrect guesses; if the column is filled first, he/she wins only the cash total.<ref>{{cite web|title=Money Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=money-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game was first played for cars with a five-digit price, the game was titled ''Big Money Game''. For cars with four-digit prices, no digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game. Also, on the [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]]-hosted syndicated version in 1985, the contestant was shown the last digit in a five-digit price, meaning the contestant had to find the third and fourth digits in addition to the first two.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====More or Less====\nThe game is played for a car and three additional prizes. The contestant is shown an incorrect price for the first prize and is asked to guess whether its actual price is more or less than the one displayed. If the contestant is correct, he or she wins that prize and moves on to the next one, with the car as the last prize. A mistake at any point ends the game, but the contestant keeps any prizes correctly priced up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|title=More or Less|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=more-or-less|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Most Expensive====\nThe contestant is shown three prizes and must choose which is the most expensive in order to win everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Expensive|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=most-empensive|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===N===\n\n====Now....or Then {{anchor|Now or Then|Now and Then}}====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items, each marked with a price, arranged on a circular gameboard. The gameboard also shows a month and year, usually from the past eight to twelve years. The contestant selects an item and must determine whether the price given for the item is the current price (now) or the price as of the specified past date (then). To win the game and a large prize, the contestant must make correct guesses for three adjacent wedges of the circle. The game ends if incorrect guesses make it impossible to claim three adjacent wedges.<ref>{{cite web|title=Now....or Then|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=now-or-then|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to December 2, 1986,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the original name of the game was ''Now....and Then''. The name was changed to reflect the decision made by the contestants.\n\n===O===\n\n====One Away====\nThe contestant is shown an incorrect price for a car. Each of the individual digits displayed is either one digit higher or one digit lower than the correct digit in the price. The contestant adjusts each digit and wins the car if they have correctly chosen all five. If all five digits are wrong, the contestant automatically loses the game. Otherwise, he or she is told the total number of digits correctly placed, but not specifically which ones and is given an opportunity to make the necessary changes. The actual price of the car is then revealed and the contestant wins if their guess matches the price.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Away|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=one-away|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====One Right Price====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes and a price corresponding to one of them. The contestant wins both prizes by correctly choosing the prize associated with the price.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Right Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=one-right-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====One Wrong Price {{anchor|1 Wrong Price}}====\nThe contestant is shown three prizes, each with accompanying prices. Two prices are correct and one is incorrect. The contestant wins everything by choosing the prize with the incorrect price.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Wrong Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=one-wrong-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===P===\n\n====Pass the Buck====\nThe game is played for a car and/or a cash prize of up to $9,000. The contestant is shown a board with six numbered spaces. Behind the numbers are one space marked with an image of a car, two spaces marked \"Lose Everything,\" and three spaces marked with cash values: $1,000, $3,000 and $5,000. The contestant is given one choice of a space at the start of the game and can earn two more.\n\nThe contestant is shown two pairs of grocery items. Within each pair, one item is correctly priced, while the other has had its price reduced by $1. Each time the contestant correctly chooses a reduced-price item, he or she wins another choice from the board. The contestant then chooses one number at a time and can quit after any turn, keeping everything he or she has won to that point. Otherwise, the game ends when all choices have been used. Finding a \"Lose Everything\" space forfeits the accumulated winnings, but the contestant may continue to play if he or she still has any choices left.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pass the Buck|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pass-the-buck|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game's history, the board had eight spaces instead of six, a third \"Lose Everything\" space and a $2,000 cash award, and the maximum cash amount that could have been won without winning the car was $10,000. Additionally, the contestant was not given a free choice at the start of the game. Instead, a third pair of grocery items (for a total of six items) was used to earn a third choice. During this period, the game ended immediately if the contestant failed to win a choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Pathfinder====\nThe game is played for a car. The gameboard features a five-by-five floor grid of 25 digits, on which the contestant must walk a five-step path to spell out the price of the car in order to win it. The contestant begins in the center square, which contains the first digit, and every correct square is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the one before it. Diagonal steps, backtracking, and stepping onto already-used squares are not allowed. If the contestant steps onto an incorrect digit at any time, he or she must back up to the last correct digit and earn a second chance by pricing one of three smaller prizes. The contestant chooses a prize and must choose the correct price from two options. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins that prize and another chance to choose the next correct digit in the car's price. If the contestant fails to choose the correct price, he or she may try to win another second chance with a different prize. If the contestant steps on an incorrect digit with no small prizes remaining or guesses the incorrect price for the third small prize, the game ends.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pathfinder|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pathfinder|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game originally offered cars with four-digit prices and an asterisk was on the center square. Contestants had to step onto all four digits without being given a free digit.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Pay the Rent====\nThis game is played using six grocery items and offers a top prize of $100,000.<ref name=\"Pay the Rent\">{{cite web|title=Pay the Rent|url=http://www.priceisright.com/show/games/pay-the-rent|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> The main prop is a house with two stories, an attic, and a mailbox. The first and second stories each have space to hold two grocery items, while the attic and mailbox can each hold only one. The contestant is asked to arrange the grocery items in the house so that the total price of the item(s) on any level is higher than the total for the previous one, starting at the mailbox and working upward toward the attic.\n\nThe contestant immediately receives $1,000 and the item prices are revealed, one level at a time. His or her winnings are increased each time that the total for a level is higher than the previous one: $5,000 for the first story, $10,000 for the second story, and $100,000 for the attic. The contestant may choose to stop the game at any time and keep all money won to that point. However, if a level total is lower than the previous one, the game ends and the contestant forfeits everything.\n\n====Pick-a-Number {{anchor|Pick a Number}}====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and its price with one digit missing. The contestant wins the prize by correctly selecting the missing digit from three possible choices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pick-a-Number|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pick-a-number|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Pick-a-Pair {{anchor|Pick a Pair}}====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose two whose prices are equal in order to win. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, the contestant may discard one of the two chosen items and make a second attempt to match the other one. The six items form three pairs of equal price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pick-a-Pair|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pick-a-pair|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Plinko====\nPlinko is played for up to $50,000. The contestant is given one free chip and can win up to four more by pricing smaller prizes. For each prize, the contestant is shown a price and must choose which digit of two displayed\u2014the first or the second\u2014is correct. The contestant wins the small prize and an extra chip for choosing the correct digit. After pricing all of the items, the contestant places one chip at a time on a pegboard (styled similarly to a [[bean machine]]), where it eventually falls into one of nine spaces at the bottom. The values of these spaces are arranged symmetrically. From the outside in, the sequence is $100\u2013$500\u2013$1,000\u2013$0, with the middle space worth $10,000. Once the chip falls into a space, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and the chip is removed from the board. If a chip becomes stuck on the board, it is knocked loose and returned to the contestant to drop again. The process is repeated until the supply of chips is exhausted, and the contestant wins the total amount of all spaces hit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plinko|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=plinko|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPlinko debuted as a pricing game in January 1983.<ref>{{cite web |first= Wade |last= Sheridan |date= May 26, 2017 |title= 'Price is Right' contestant wins record $31.5K playing Plinko |url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2017/05/26/Price-is-Right-contestant-wins-record-315K-playing-Plinko/3001495793756/ |publisher= UPI |accessdate= July 28, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the center space was worth $5,000, with a potential top prize of $25,000.\n\n====Pocket Change====\nThe game is played for a car. The contestant begins the game with $0.25, which is given as the car's initial selling price. Six digits are shown, five of which belong to the price of the car. The first digit in the price is revealed, and the contestant attempts to guess the remaining four digits, one at a time. Each incorrect choice raises the car's selling price by $0.25. When a digit is correctly chosen, it is removed from play and the contestant selects one of 20 envelopes from a gameboard without opening it. Each envelope contains a value between $0.00 and $2.00.\n\nAfter the contestant correctly guesses the fifth digit and selects a final envelope, the envelopes (four in all) are opened and the values inside are added to the initial bank of $0.25. If the bank total meets or exceeds the car's selling price, the contestant wins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pocket Change|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pocket-change|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first time the game was played, the contestant was not given the first digit and was required to guess all five digits in the price, resulting in five envelopes to be added to the initial $0.25.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Punch-a-Bunch====\nThe game is played for a top prize of $25,000. The contestant answers higher-or-lower pricing questions about four items, one at a time. Each correct answer earns a punch on a 5-by-10 [[punchboard]]. The contestant punches holes into the appropriate number of spaces on the board, each of which contains a slip of paper with an amount of money written on it. The host then reveals the amount written on each slip, one at a time, beginning with the first hole punched. One hole contains the $25,000 prize, while the others contain amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. The contestant may either accept the amount on the slip and end the game, or discard it in favor of the next hole he/she punched. The game continues until the contestant either quits, wins the top prize, or reaches the last of their slips, in which case he or she must keep the last amount.\n\nPrior to September 29, 2011,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} four slips displayed both a cash amount and the message \"Second Chance.\" Finding one allowed the contestant to punch another hole immediately, and the value inside was added to the one on the Second Chance slip. While this rule was in effect, a contestant could win more than the top prize amount by finding it on a Second Chance punch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punch-a-Bunch|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=punch-a-bunch|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe top prize from September 27, 1978{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} to October 1, 2008{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} was $10,000, with $50 as the lowest amount on the board.\n\nAlthough the same pricing method was used to earn punches, the first 11 playings of Punch-a-Bunch used a different cash distribution and punch format. Each of the letters in the word \"PUNCHBOARD\" concealed a different number, with two each of 1 through 4 and one each of 5 and 10. After punching one of the letters, the contestant punched a hole in the field of 50 holes on the board. Twenty of the holes contained slips marked \"Dollars\", another 20 contained slips marked \"Hundred\" and the remaining 10 contained slips marked \"Thousand\". The number punched was multiplied by the phrase on the slip to determine the contestant's award (e.g., punching a ten and the word \"Thousand\" earned the contestant $10,000).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Push Over====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and a series of nine numbered blocks which includes the correct price. A blue window, four blocks wide, is positioned at the far right end of a shelf, beyond which is a bin. The contestant wins the prize by pushing the entire row of blocks until the correct price is shown in the window. However, once blocks fall over the edge into the bin, they cannot be retrieved. This game has occasionally been played for cars and other prizes valued over $10,000, using a window wide enough to display a five-digit price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Push Over|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=push-over|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===R===\n\n====Race Game====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and given a set of tags with their prices. The contestant then has 45 seconds to match the prices with the correct prizes. To see how many he or she has correct, the contestant pulls a lever on a display which then lights up the number of correctly-placed tags. If the contestant has fewer than four right, he or she may rearrange the prices and pull the lever as often as time allows. Once time runs out, the contestant wins any prizes he or she has correctly priced at that point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=race-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Range Game====\nA $600 range for the price of a prize is displayed as a vertical scale. A $150 range finder moves up the scale, starting from the bottom, and the contestant has one opportunity to stop it by pressing a button. If the range finder is covering the correct price when stopped, the contestant wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Range Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=range-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original range was $50, but it was quickly increased to $100. The range was $200 for a brief period during the 1970s on the syndicated version of the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Rat Race====\nThe contestant must price three items within specified ranges: a grocery item priced under $10 within $1; a small prize priced under $100 within $10; and a medium prize priced under $500 within $100. For each bid given within the correct range, the contestant chooses one of five colored mechanical rats (yellow, green, pink, orange and blue), which are positioned on a large dollar sign-shaped racetrack. The rats are then set in motion on the track and all five rats ultimately travel the same distance. The contestant wins a car, a large prize, or an additional medium-valued prize if a chosen rat finishes first, second, or third. More than one prize can be won, depending upon the number of rats chosen and how they finish the race.<ref name=\"rat race\">{{cite web|title=Rat Race|work=Price Is Right|url=http://www.priceisright.com/show/games/rat-race|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===S===\n\n====Safe Crackers====\nThe contestant attempts to win two prizes by guessing the three-digit combination of a giant safe that contains both prizes. The combination is the same as the price of the less expensive prize. The contestant is given the three unique digits and must use each of them only once to determine the correct price in order to open the safe and win both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safe Crackers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=safe-crackers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Secret \"X\" {{anchor|Secret X}}====\nThis game is played on a giant [[tic-tac-toe]] board with a secret X hidden in the center column. At the start of the game, the contestant is given one free X to place anywhere in either the left or right column of the board. Two small prizes are then shown, each with two possible prices. Each time the contestant correctly prices a prize, he or she wins it and receives another X. After placing the additional X's, the secret X is revealed. The contestant wins the game and a large prize if he or she has formed a line of three either horizontally or diagonally. If the contestant earns no additional X's, the game ends immediately. Contestants cannot win the game by placing all three of their X's on the same column to create a vertical line; a winning line must include the secret X.<ref>{{cite web|title=Secret \"X\"|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=secret-x|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Shell Game====\nPlayed similarly to the [[Shell game|carnival game of the same name]], the game features four shells, one of which conceals a ball. The contestant is asked whether each of four prizes is actually priced higher or lower than a given incorrect price. For each correct guess, the contestant wins that small prize and a chip to place beside one of the shells. If the contestant places a chip beside the shell containing the ball, he or she wins a bonus prize. A contestant who correctly prices all four items automatically wins the prize, and can also win a cash amount equal to the prize value by correctly guessing which shell conceals the ball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shell Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=shell-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode | series = The Price is Right | network = CBS | number = 5282K | airdate = 26 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, this bonus was $500 on the daytime show, and $1,000 on the 1970s syndicated version. On the 1985\u201386 syndicated version, the bonus was originally $500, then $1,000. Eventually, it was awarded for correctly pricing all four items, without having to select the right shell.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Shopping Spree====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and chooses three of them, one at a time.

The contestant is shown a pair of two-digit numbers and must decide the order in which they should be placed to form the correct price (e.g. \"75\" and 42\" can give options of $7,542 and $4,275). If the contestant chooses correctly, he/she wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side by Side|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=side-by-side|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spelling Bee====\nThe game is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $5,000. A gameboard contains 30 cards: eleven Cs, eleven As, six Rs, and two \"CAR\"s. In order to win the car, the contestant must choose either one of each letter or a CAR card. The contestant chooses two free cards from the board and may win up to three more by pricing each of three small prizes within $10 of their actual prices, high or low. If the contestant guesses any price exactly, he/she automatically wins all three prizes and cards, even if he/she had missed on previous guesses. After the cards are chosen, the contestant is offered $1,000 per card to quit the game and walk away. The cards are revealed one at a time. If the car is not yet won, the cash buyout offer is repeated with the remaining cards. The contestant wins nothing if he or she fails to spell CAR or get one of the two CAR cards after the last card is revealed. If the contestant does win the car, however, he or she does not receive cash for any remaining cards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spelling Bee|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=spelling-bee|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2007, each card was worth $500, for a maximum buyout of $2,500.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} \n\n====Squeeze Play====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and a price that has had one incorrect digit inserted; the first and last digits are always correct. To win the prize, the contestant must remove the extra middle digit to leave behind the correct price. This game has been played for prizes with four- and five-digit prices, giving the contestant a choice between three and four middle digits, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squeeze Play|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=sqeeze-play|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Stack the Deck====\nThe game is played for a car. The contestant is shown seven playing cards containing digits, five of which make up the price of the car. Three pairs of grocery items are displayed, and the contestant must guess which item in each pair corresponds to a given price. Each correct guess allows him/her to fill in one correct digit in the price of the car. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to win the car by correctly filling in all remaining digits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stack the Deck|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=stack-the-deck|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Swap Meet====\nThe contestant is shown a base prize and three more prizes. In order to win all four, he or she must \"swap\" the base prize by choosing the prize from the group of three whose price is the same as the base prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swap Meet|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=swap-meet|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Switch? {{anchor|Switch}}====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes, each with a price. The contestant must decide whether the prices are correct as shown or need to be switched with each other. A correct decision wins both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Switch?|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=switch|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Switcheroo====\nThis game is played for a car and four additional prizes under $100. The contestant is shown the prices for the five prizes, each of which is missing its tens digit, and given five blocks with the missing digits. The contestant has 30 seconds to complete the prices using these blocks. After either the time limit expires or the contestant is satisfied, the number of correct prices is revealed, but not specifically which ones. If all five prices are correct, the contestant immediately wins everything. If fewer than five are correct, he or she may take another 30 seconds to change the prices if desired, or leave them as they are. The extra time is given by default if none of the prices are correct. Once the game ends, due to the contestant either using the extra 30 seconds or leaving the prices alone, he/she wins all prizes that are correctly priced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Switcheroo|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=switcheroo|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===T===\n\n====Take Two====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and a target total. He or she has two chances to win everything by choosing the two whose prices match the total when added together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Take Two|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=take-two|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Temptation====\nThe contestant is shown the first digit in the price of a car and is then presented with four additional prizes, each of which has only two distinct digits in its price. As each prize is presented, the contestant selects one digit from its price to fill in the price of the car. After the last prize is shown, he or she is given a chance to change any digits and must then make another choice: take the four prizes and quit the game, or risk them and try for the car. If the contestant tries for the car and has the correct price, he or she wins everything. If any digits are incorrect, he or she loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Temptation|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=temptation|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, when the game was played for cars with four-digit prices, the first digit was not given. Also, early playings of the game included prizes with three different digits in their prices as well as prizes with two-digit prices. In addition, when the game debuted, contestants were not given the option to change any digits after making their initial selections.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====10 Chances====\nThe contestant is given ten chances to correctly price three prizes. The first has a two-digit price, the second a three-digit price, and the third is a car. The contestant is given three unique digits for the first prize and must guess the price using two of them. The process repeats for the second prize, with four digits given to the contestant. For the car, the contestant is given five digits and must use all of them to guess its price. No digit may be repeated in any guess. The game ostensibly includes a ten-second time limit for writing down each choice, though this is rarely enforced. The contestant wins any prizes that he or she has correctly priced after all ten chances are used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Chances|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=ten-chances|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the game used cars with four digits in the price and the contestant had to use four of the five available digits in each guess.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====That's Too Much====\nThe contestant is shown up to ten prices for a car in ascending order, one at a time. The contestant wins the car by correctly identifying the first revealed price which is higher than the actual price by calling out \"That's Too Much!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=That's Too Much|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=thats-too-much|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====3 Strikes====\nThe contestant is shown eight baseballs: five marked with digits in the price of a car and three \"strike\" balls marked with an X. The balls are placed into a hopper and mixed, and the contestant blindly draws one ball at a time. If a digit is drawn, the contestant must guess where it belongs in the price. If correct, the digit appears in that position on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. If incorrect, the ball is returned to the hopper without penalty. If a strike is drawn, an X is lit up in the strike display on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. To win the car, the contestant must fill in every digit before drawing all three strikes.<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Strikes|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=three-strikes|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2018, discs were used rather than baseballs, and they were placed in a bag rather than a hopper. When the game began in 1976, there were seven discs in the bag: the four digits of the price and the three strikes. As the value of cars went past $10,000 in the mid-1980s, the game was briefly known as ''3 Strikes +'' when cars priced above $10,000 were first offered. Since 1993, the game has been played for vehicles priced at least $30,000, typically luxury vehicles, premium trucks, or electric cars. Since 2013, cars priced above $100,000 have occasionally been offered; in these playings, a sixth disc or ball with the extra digit is used.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2008, only one strike chip was used, and it was returned to the bag after being drawn. The contestant lost by drawing the strike chip three times. During a brief period during Season 37 (2008), the first digit in the price was lit at the beginning of the game, with chips representing the remaining four digits plus the three strike chips placed in the bag.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Time Is Money====\nThe contestant is shown five grocery items that must be placed on tables with specific price ranges: $0 to $2.99, $3 to $5.99, and $6 and higher. The contestant is given ten seconds and one chance to place all five items in their proper categories. Doing so correctly awards $20,000. If the contestant fails to place them correctly, he or she is given 40 seconds to make changes, with the potential prize decreasing steadily at a rate of $500 per second. The contestant may rearrange items as often as time permits, and must press a button after each attempt to learn the result. If he or she places the items correctly, the clock is stopped and he or she wins any remaining money. The contestant is never told how many items or which ones are correctly placed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Is Money|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=time-is-money|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> The revamped game premiered on September 22, 2014.<ref>{{cite episode|series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=22 September 2014 |season=43 |number=6811K }}</ref> \n\nUnder the original rules the game was played for a large prize and $500 instead of $20,000 cash. The contestant had 15 seconds to correctly group all of the items. If the contestant was correct, he or she also won $500 in addition to the prize. If unsuccessful, the contestant could stop playing and keep the $500, or exchange it for another 15 seconds to regroup the items, without knowing how many items were incorrectly placed or which ones. After two playings, the rules were changed to remove the $500 bonus and offer the contestant two chances to correctly place the items, with a 20-second time limit for each chance. If any were placed incorrectly after the first chance, the contestant was told how many items were incorrectly placed (although not specifically which individual products were placed correctly). If the contestant was incorrect on the second chance, the game ended and he or she won nothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Triple Play====\nTriple Play is the only game to regularly offer three cars. The contestant is shown two price choices for the first car, three for the second and four for the third. For each car, the contestant must choose which of the displayed prices is closest to the actual price of the car without going over. The contestant may not stop the game after correctly pricing the first or second car. If the contestant chooses correctly for all three cars, he or she wins everything. If the contestant chooses incorrectly at any point, the game ends and he or she wins nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Triple Play|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=triple=play|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====2 for the Price of 1====\nThe game is played for two prizes, one of which has three digits in its price. The contestant must select which of two digits displayed is the correct digit in each position of the price. The contestant is offered a free digit of his or her choice and then selects which of the remaining digits are correct. If the contestant correctly determines the price, he or she wins both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=2 for the Price of 1|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=two-for-the-price-of-one|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===V===\n\n====Vend-O-Price====\nThree grocery items are displayed on separate shelves of a gameboard resembling a [[vending machine]], from top to bottom in increasing order of price.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Price Is Right |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=25 September 2015 |season=44 |number=7215K}}</ref> The contestant inserts a coin into the machine, and the shelves' sliding doors open to reveal a different quantity of each item. In order to win, the contestant must choose the shelf with the highest total price, based on the price for one unit multiplied by the number of items on its shelf.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vend-O-Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=vend-o-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Inactive games==\nWhen the 1972 version of the show premiered, many games did not have official names which were used on the air. Some of the names below are unofficial or assigned by the production staff.\n\n===A===\n\n====Add 'Em Up====\nThe contestant was shown a car whose price contained four unique digits and was told their sum. He/she chose one digit to be revealed and had to guess the other three, one at a time and in any order. The total of all correctly guessed digits was shown on the gameboard. In order to win the car, the contestant had to guess all of the missing digits before making two mistakes.\n\n===B===\n\n====Balance Game{{anchor|Balance Game 1984}}====\nFive small prizes were presented and the contestant was given five \"Barker silver dollar\" coins. The contestant attempted to balance a scale with a combination of prizes added to each side. The contestant chose one prize at a time and assigned it to either the left or right side of the scale. Coins representing the value of the prize were placed on the side selected. If the totals of the prizes on both sides matched at any time, the contestant won a larger prize package. If the totals agreed to within $5, he or she could use the provided coins to balance the scale and win. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any prizes he or she chose during the game as well as any unused coins.\n\n====Bullseye{{anchor|Bullseye 1972}}====\nThe contestant was given seven chances to guess the actual price of a car. In response to each guess, the host told the contestant whether the actual price was higher or lower. In some appearances of the game, the contestant was given a $500 range into which the price fell.\n\n====Bump====\nThe contestant was shown two prizes and a British-themed gameboard containing four double-decker buses, each marked with a price. The far left and far right buses displayed the same price, and the prizes' names were placed below the two middle buses. A model stood at each end of the row, and the contestant chose one of them to bump the buses, resulting in either the leftmost or rightmost two coming to rest above the prize names and the others being removed/knocked from the board. The contestant won both prizes if the buses' prices matched those of the prizes below them.\n\n====Buy or Sell====\nThree prizes were shown, each with an incorrect price. The contestant bought prizes he or she believed were under-priced and sold prizes he or she believed were overpriced. The actual prices were then revealed, one at a time. For each correct decision, the difference between the two prices was added to a bank. For each incorrect decision, the difference was subtracted from the bank. If the contestant had a positive bank balance at the end of the game, he/she won everything as well as any money accumulated in the bank. The most money that could be accumulated was $1,900. Prior to 1997, winning contestants did not receive any money accumulated.\n\n===C===\n\n====Clearance Sale====\nThree prizes were shown and the contestant was given three price tags, each of which bore a sale price lower than one of the items' actual retail price. The contestant placed a price tag on each prize and won everything if each of the sale prices was below the actual price of its respective prize.\n\n====Credit Card====\nFive prizes were shown, each usually worth between $200 and $3,000. The contestant was then presented with a large [[credit card]], which was inserted into an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], which then displayed a credit limit (usually $1,800 to $2,500). The contestant then chose three prizes, one at a time, and their prices were deducted from the credit limit. If the contestant did not exceed the limit with the three choices, he/she won everything.\n\n===D===\n\n====Double Bullseye====\n\nThe original Bullseye game was reworked into a two-player format after never producing a winner. In doing so, the game became the only pricing game which guaranteed a winner. After the first contestant won his or her way on stage, another contestant was called from the audience, and another item went up for bids. After the second contestant won his or her way on stage, the car was shown.  Barker asked each one to give him a bid on the price of the car after giving a price range of $500. He then told the opponent whether the price was higher or lower than the bid, and the two alternated until one gave the exact price, winning the car.\n\nAustralia's version of ''The Price is Right'' used this format for their Showcase round. Hosts [[Ian Turpie]] or [[Larry Emdur]] gave a price range and asked the two contestants to bid in the same manner. Whoever gave the exact price won the opportunity to play for the showcase.\n\n====Double Digits====\nA car was shown along with four small prizes. For each small prize, the contestant was shown the second digit in that prize's price, and then two possibilities for the first digit. The contestant attempted to select the correct first digit in the price, which also corresponded to a digit in the car's price. If the four correct digits had been chosen, the contestant won everything. If the contestant failed to win the car, he or she still won any small prizes which were priced correctly.\n\n===F===\n\n====Finish Line====\nSix small prizes were described in three pairs. For each pair, the contestant tried to pick the more expensive item. The sum of the prices of the rejected prizes made up a finish line that a miniature horse and jockey would have to cross. After all three choices were made, the horse moved one step for each dollar in the total value of the prizes the contestant had selected. If the horse passed the finish line, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept the three chosen prizes.\n\n====Fortune Hunter====\nFortune Hunter was played for four prizes and $5,000. It involved four boxes, one of which contained the cash prize. The host read three clues to help the contestant eliminate the prizes associated with them, based on their prices. The remaining box was then opened. If the cash was hidden inside, the contestant won everything. However, if the chosen box was empty, the contestant won nothing.\n\nThe contestant did not have to eliminate the prizes in the order the clues were read. The prizes could be eliminated in any order, as long as only the box that contained the money was left.\n\n===G===\n\n====Gallery Game====\nA painting of a prize was shown to the contestant. Below the painting was a price, which was missing part of one digit. The contestant won by correctly painting in that digit.\n\n====Give or Keep====\nSix small prizes were presented in three pairs. From each pair, the contestant picked what he believed was the more expensive prize. If the sum of the prices of the prizes the contestant kept was equal to or greater than the sum of the prices of the prizes they gave away, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant won the three prizes they chose to keep.\n\n===H===\n\n====Hit Me====\nThe contestant played [[blackjack]] against the house, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting). Before the game began, the contestant cut a deck of oversized playing cards and two were dealt out as the house's starting hand, the first one face down as a hole card. The contestant was then shown six grocery items, each of which displayed a price that was equal to its actual price multiplied by a whole number from 1 to 10. Each item had a card hidden underneath it, whose value was equal to that item's multiplier. One of the six items displayed its actual price and would give an ace if chosen, while another showed a price multiplied by 10. Aces could count as 1 or 11.\n\nThe contestant chose items and received their cards until he or she either reached a total of 21, busted, or chose to stop. Reaching 21 with any combination of cards was an automatic win, regardless of the house's hand. If the contestant stopped, the house's hole card was revealed and, if necessary, additional cards were dealt from the deck until its total reached 17 or higher. The contestant won if his or her total matched or exceeded the house's total without busting, or if the house busted. If the contestant busted, he or she immediately lost the game.\n\nSituations involving an ace in the house's hand (whether it should be counted as one or eleven even when the result would be in favor of the house) were handled inconsistently over the course of the game's time on the show.\n\n====Hurdles====\nA grocery item was described, and its price was attached to a runner figure on a gameboard. The contestant was shown three pairs of items and asked to choose the one in each pair that he/she believed was lower in price than the base item; each choice was marked with a blue flag. Once he/she had made all three choices, a starter's pistol was fired and the runner began to move across the board, with a hurdle rising from each chosen item as he approached it. If the contestant chose correctly, the hurdle would stop rising in time for the runner to clear it. If the runner cleared all three hurdles, the contestant won the game and a large prize. However, if the contestant chose incorrectly at any point, the runner would crash into that item's hurdle and the game ended.\n\n===I===\n\n====It's Optional====\nTwo cars were shown, each of the same make and model. The contestant was told the second car was priced a set amount higher than the first and told the difference in the two prices, then shown a list of a list of nine options. Selecting options one at a time, the contestant attempted to increase the price of the first car to within $100 of the price of the second car without going over. The number of options a contestant was allowed to choose during the course of the game changed each time it was played but was generally between three and five.\n\n===J===\n\n====Joker====\nThe contestant was shown a hand of five face-down cards, one of which was a joker. Four small prizes were presented, each with a displayed price. For each one, the contestant had to decide whether or not to reverse the digits in order to obtain the correct price (e.g. $37 or $73). Each correct choice awarded that prize and allowed the contestant to discard one card from the hand. He/she won the game if the joker was found among the discards.\n\n===M===\n\n====Make Your Mark {{anchor|Barker's Markers}}====\nThree prizes were shown along with four prices on a gameboard. The contestant was given $500 and chose the three prices he/she believed were correct, using a marker to note each selection. Two correct prices were revealed among the three marked ones and matched to their prizes, and the contestant then had to decide whether to leave the last marker where it was, or return the $500 and switch the marker to the one un-chosen price. If the contestant chose correctly, he/she won all three prizes and kept the $500 if he/she had not returned it. If the third choice was incorrect, the contestant won nothing. \n\nThe game was originally titled ''Barker's Markers'' in reference to former host [[Bob Barker]], but was re-titled ''Make Your Mark'' after Drew Carey took over as host and during the game's single appearance on the [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|1994 syndicated version]] hosted by Doug Davidson.\n\nOn the October 9, 2008 episode,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right|network=CBS |date=9 October 2008 |season=37 |number=4464K}}</ref> the only playing of Make Your Mark in season 37, [[Drew Carey]] incorrectly explained the rules that the contestant was allowed to keep the $500 regardless of whether or not they ultimately won the game, so long as they did not change the last marker.\n\n====Mystery Price====\nA prize package was presented to the contestant and the price of the least expensive item in the package was dubbed the \"mystery price\". Four smaller prizes were shown individually and the contestant placed a bid on each of them. If their bid was equal to or lower than the item's actual price, the contestant won that prize and the amount of their bid was placed into a bank. If the contestant overbid on the prize, it was lost and no value was added to the bank.\n\nAfter all four small prizes were played, the mystery price was revealed. The contestant won the larger prize package in addition to any small prizes they did not overbid on if the bank was equal to or greater than the mystery price.\n\n===O===\n\n====On the Nose====\nIn order to win a car, the contestant competed in one of five possible sporting events. The events varied each time the game was played and included throwing a baseball or football into a specified area, shooting a basketball into a hoop, hitting a tennis ball with a racket into a specified area or popping a balloon with a dart.\n\nAfter being shown the car, the contestant was presented with four possible prices. The contestant selected the one they believed was the actual price of the car and, if correct, won a $1,000 bonus and four attempts at the sporting event preselected for that day. The further away the selected price was from the actual price, the fewer attempts at the sporting event the contestant received with no bonus. If the contestant succeeded in the sporting event, he or she won the car.\n\n====On the Spot====\nSix small prizes were described and the contestant was shown three paths, colored blue, yellow and pink, extending outward from a center black spot. Each path was marked with three prices. To win a car, the contestant attempted to match the three prices in any path to the six prizes in play. After choosing a path, the contestant had to correctly determine which prize was associated with each price along the path in turn. If the contestant made a mistake, they returned to the center spot and chose a new path. Making mistakes on all three paths ended the game. The contestant won any prizes he/she correctly priced.\n\nSome of the prices on a path were repeated on other paths, and the contestant could automatically step to the next price along the path if he or she had already correctly matched the associated prize on a previous path.\n\n===P===\n\n====Penny Ante====\nTwo grocery items were described. For each item, four possible prices were presented. The contestant was given three oversized pennies and attempted to select the correct price for each item, one at a time. Each mistake the contestant made cost him or her a penny. The contestant won a larger prize if he or she was able to guess the actual price of both items before losing all three pennies.\n\nThe first five times the game was played, the board was not divided into halves for each grocery item. Instead, the two correct prices were hidden among all eight choices. Whenever an incorrect price was guessed, one penny fell from the side of the gameboard into a bucket for each cent in the amount of the guess. A scoreboard was attached to the front of the gameboard, which kept track of the pennies accumulated. The contestant lost the game if the total of the incorrect guesses made before finding the two correct prices equaled 100 pennies or more.\n\n====The Phone Home Game====\nThe contestant and a preselected home viewer competing via telephone teamed to attempt to win up to $15,000. Before the game began, the home viewer was given a list of the actual prices for each of seven grocery items. The items were then described to the contestant and the home viewer gave a price for one of the items. The contestant selected the item he or she believed matched that price. If the contestant was correct, the team shared a hidden cash award associated with that specific product. If the contestant was incorrect, both the guessed product and the correct product were removed from play and their cash awards were lost. The contestant and home viewer attempted to make three correct matches and win three cash awards. If the home viewer read the name of a grocery item at any time instead of a price, that turn was lost.\n\nThe cash awards for the matched products were revealed and the team split the total amount won. The cash awards hidden beside the seven products included one each of $10,000, $3,000, and $2,000, and two each of $1,000 and $200.\n\n====Poker Game====\nFour prizes were shown, all with three-digit prices. The contestant selected two of the prizes and the digits in their prices were used to form the best possible five-card poker hand, with nines high and zeroes low. After the hand was revealed, the contestant chose either to keep it or pass it to the house. The prices of the other two prizes were then revealed and assembled into a second poker hand. If the contestant had a better hand than the house, he or she won everything.\n\nThe hand rankings were similar to those of poker and were, from highest to lowest: five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card. However, straights did not count, and without suits, flushes were not possible.\n\nIn early playings, the contestant was allowed to make their hand with any five of the six digits of the prices of the two prizes they had chosen, but did not have the option to pass their chosen hand to the house.\n\n====Professor Price====\nThe last two digits in the price of a car were revealed, and the contestant was asked a series of general knowledge questions with single-digit numerical answers. (Example: \"How many ounces are there in half a pound?\" \u2013 answer: 8.) After each question, the contestant had to guess whether that digit was one of the first two in the price. If it was, it was revealed whether the contestant guessed correctly or not. The contestant won the car for giving three correct answers/guesses, or lost for missing three.\n\nA large animatronic puppet known as Professor Price was central to the game. The contestant's progress was tracked by the puppet's hands, with correct answers/guesses counted by upward-pointing fingers on the right hand and incorrect ones counted by downward-pointing fingers on the left. As with the Clock Game, the audience was required to remain silent while the game was in progress.\n\nThe game was played only twice, making it the shortest-lived game in the show's history. It was also the only game to have a perfect record, having been won both times it was played.\n\n===S===\n\n====Shower Game====\nThe contestant was shown six shower stalls, each marked with a possible price for a car. Three stalls contained confetti, two contained $100 in one-dollar bills, and the one with the actual price contained a giant car key. The contestant entered a stall and pulled its chain, triggering the release of its contents. Finding confetti allowed him or her to choose again. As soon as the contestant found either the $100 or the car, the game ended and he or she won that prize.\n\n====Split Decision====\nA car and a medium prize were shown and a string of eight digits was displayed on a gameboard. The numbers in the prices of the prizes appeared in order but were not necessarily placed side by side. The contestant was given 20 seconds to pull down the three digits that made up the price of the smaller prize, leaving the five digits that made up the price of the car. To stop the clock, the contestant pushed a button on the gameboard. If the correct three-digit price for the smaller prize had been pulled down, the contestant won both prizes. If incorrect, the contestant continued guessing until a correct guess was made or time ran out.\n\nA later variation in the rules did not feature a clock. Instead, the contestant was given only three chances to win.\n\n====Step Up====\nThe contestant had a chance to win up to four prizes and $3,000 cash. He/she selected one prize, whose price was immediately revealed, then attempted to choose a more expensive one. A correct choice awarded both prizes and $500, after which the contestant could either stop the game or try to choose a still more expensive prize. If this choice was correct, he/she also won the third prize and an additional $1,000 and had the same choice to stop or continue. If the contestant continued, and the last prize was the most expensive of all, he/she won it as well and an additional $1,500. However, an incorrect guess at any time ended the game and the contestant lost everything.\n\n====Super Ball!!====\nThe contestant had a chance to win up to three large prizes by rolling balls up a [[skee ball]] ramp. The ball for each large prize was presented alongside a small prize displaying two possible prices. If the contestant chose the correct price, he/she won that small prize and earned the corresponding ball. The ramp contained three rings: $50 and $100, which awarded those cash amounts, and WIN, which awarded the large prize for that ball. The contestant was given a practice ball to roll before attempting to win any of the large prizes.\n\nA fourth small prize was then revealed. If the contestant priced it correctly, he/she won it and earned a \"Super Ball.\" Rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring awarded all three large prizes, while rolling it into either cash ring awarded triple the marked value. If the contestant had already won all three large prizes, he/she could earn a $3,000 bonus by rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring.\n\n====Super Saver====\nSix grocery items were presented, five marked below their actual retail price and one marked above. The contestant chose four of the items, one at a time, and the difference between the marked price and the actual price was added to a bank. Choosing the overpriced item deducted that difference from the bank. The contestant won the game by saving a total of at least $1 after the four choices. Even if the overpriced item was chosen, it was always mathematically possible to win the game by selecting three products with the largest differences below the actual prices. Also, the contestant was required to choose four items even if the bank total exceeded $1 after the first two or three selections.\n\n===T===\n\n====Telephone Game====\nA car and two smaller prizes were shown, along with four grocery items. The contestant was given $1 to purchase two of the four grocery items, attempting to spend no more than 90\u00a2 so that he or she would have a dime left in order to use a pay telephone. If the contestant succeeded, he or she dialed one of three given four-digit telephone numbers and won the prize whose price was associated with that number, indicated by a model answering the telephone placed next to it. The number for the car represented its price in dollars, while the numbers for the two small prizes represented their prices in dollars and cents. The contestant won nothing if their grocery item purchase exceeded 90\u00a2.\n\n====Trader Bob====\nThe contestant was presented with one small prize and was then shown three pairs of additional prizes. By choosing one prize from each pair in the order they were presented, the contestant attempted to \"trade up\" from that initial prize and create a sequence of four prizes in ascending order of price. If the contestant successfully traded up with all three choices, he or she won both the last small prize chosen and a larger prize package. If not, the contestant won only the first small prize chosen that was lower in price than the one before it.\n\n===W===\n\n====Walk of Fame====\nThe contestant could win up to four prizes by guessing their prices within a set range, high or low. The prizes were presented in order of increasing value, and the winning range increased from one to the next. If the contestant missed on any of the first three prizes, he/she was given a choice of two autograph books signed by the show's cast. One book also contained a page marked \"Second Chance\". If the contestant chose this book, he/she moved on to the next prize, but the one he/she had missed was taken out of play. The game ended once the contestant made a second mistake, failed to choose the \"Second Chance\" book, or made a mistake on the fourth prize.\n\n==Special rule changes==\nRules to certain pricing games have occasionally been changed on special episodes. \n\n=== 1986 summer specials ===\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 After winning both prizes the contestant blindly chose a cash bonus from one of four envelopes with possible values of $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 and $5,000.\n* \"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000.\n\n=== 2002\u201308 prime time specials ===\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 The bonus for winning both prizes within 30 seconds was increased to $5,000.\n* \"Grand Game\" \u2013 The top prize was increased to $20,000, with the winnings ranging from $2, $20, $200, and $2,000.\n* \"1/2 Off\" \u2013 The top prize was increased to $25,000.\n* \"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000.\n* \"It's In the Bag\" \u2013 The last bag's value was increased to $24,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n* \"Plinko\" \u2013 The game was played for $100,000, with the middle slot increased to $20,000.\n* \"Punch a Bunch\" \u2013 The top prize was originally $25,000, then later increased to $50,000.\nDuring episodes of ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'', contestants had an opportunity to win the $1 million bonus in the showcase showdown for spinning a $1.00 in their bonus spin.  If no contestant earned a bonus spin in either showcase showdown, the ultimate winner of the showcase would be given the opportunity to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus.  If no contestant earned a bonus spin and both contestants overbid in the showcase, a new contestant would be called from the audience at the end of the show to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus; this was later changed to allow the contestant who made the smaller overbid to spin.\n\n===''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular''===\nIn 2008, episodes of ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'' featured rule changes to some pricing games which awarded a $1 million bonus to the contestant for achieving specific goals.\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 The contestant was required to guess the retail prices of both prizes within a total of 10 seconds to win the bonus.

A $1 million check was hidden in one of the other 15 boxes, and the contestant had one chance to guess where it was. An incorrect guess forfeited the $25,000.\n* \"Plinko\" \u2013 If at least three chips landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant was given a golden Plinko chip. If the golden chip landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant won the bonus. Otherwise, the contestant won the money amount associated with where the chip landed.\n* \"Punch a Bunch\" \u2013 The contestant could win the bonus by finding the $50,000 prize with their first punch.\n* \"Range Game\" \u2013 After stopping the range finder, the contestant provided a guess for the exact price of the prize. If the correct price fell within the $150 range, the contestant won the prize. If their exact guess matched the actual retail price of the prize, the contestant also won the bonus.\n* \"Safe Crackers\" \u2013 After winning the game under the standard rules, the contestant could quit with the prizes won (one of which was always a car) or risk them to try for the bonus. The safe was re-locked with a new five-digit combination that was the same as the price of the car. Each dial contained the same five digits. However, each digit did not necessarily appear in the price of the car, and the contestant was told the price of the car could potentially contain repeated digits. Setting the correct combination won the bonus, while an incorrect combination forfeited everything.\n* \"Switcheroo\" \u2013 The contestant could win the bonus by correctly pricing all five prizes within the initial 30 seconds.\n\n===Specially-themed episodes===\nStarting in 2012, rule changes were also made to some pricing games for episodes with special themes, mostly Big Money Week, Dream Car Week, or episodes where viewers could choose game options via Twitter.

A different celebrity appeared on each episode to assist the contestants in their pricing games, and the show donated enough money to the celebrity's favorite charity to match the total winnings of all contestants. In addition, the celebrity spun the Big Wheel once during the second Showcase Showdown, and the result was multiplied by 100 and added to the donation (e.g. a spin of 60 cents added $6,000).\n*During the Premiere weeks since Season 46:\n**In Season 46 (in conjunction with Drew Carey's 10th anniversary as host), a contestant could win $10,000 for spinning a dollar during the Showcase Showdown; in the premiere episode (aired September 18, 2017), while pricing game winners wins an additional $10,000 bonus, spinning $1.00 in the bonus spin also awards the contestant a $100,000 bonus.\n**During Season 47's Premiere episode (aired September 17, 2018), in honour on the [[45th Daytime Emmy Awards|eighth]] ''[[Daytime Emmy Award]]'' win for the [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]], the bonus for spinning $1.00 before the bonus spin was increased to $8,000, while landing on the $1.00 in the bonus spin was increased to $80,000.\n**During the first week of Season 48 (September 23 to September 27, 2019), the first contestant to win a pricing game on each episode received a bonus prize in addition to his/her other winnings.\n*During the 9,000th milestone episode (aired October 10, 2019), contestants winning a Pricing Game won a $9,000 bonus. During the episode's showcase showdown, the $1.00 bonus before the bonus spin was increased to $9,000.\n\n===Mash-up Week===\nFor each episode which aired during the week of May 9, 2016 and March 23, 2020, one of the games from ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' was imported to ''The Price is Right'' and played as a pricing game. The rules were modified slightly to require the contestants to price items.\n\n* \"Car Pong\" \u2013 The contestant was shown four small prizes, one of which was priced at a stated amount, and tried to pick the other three, one at a time. Each correct choice added five seconds to a base time of five seconds, but an incorrect choice revealed a Zonk and ended this phase of the game immediately. The contestant then stood at one end of a table and tried to bounce ping-pong balls into a set of nine cups arranged in a diamond formation at the other end, using the accumulated time (a maximum of 20 seconds). Landing a ball in the center cup won a car; the other eight cups awarded cash amounts of $250, $500, or $1,000.\n* \"Go for a Spin\" \u2013 A wheel divided into 16 sections was used, with a car symbol in one section, Zonks in five others, and cash amounts from $100 to $5,000 in the remaining ten. The contestant was shown three small prizes and had to choose the correct price for each from two options. Each correct choice allowed the contestant to replace one Zonk with a car symbol. The contestant could then either accept $500 per correct choice and end the game, or spin the wheel once and win the prize on which it stopped: cash, a car, or nothing for a Zonk.\n* \"Gold Rush\" \u2013 The contestant was shown seven numbered boxes, five of which corresponded to digits in the price of a car (indicated by a mine cart full of gold). The other two held bundles of dynamite. The contestant had to select all five correct digits in any order to win the car. The contestant won $500 for the first correct digit chosen, and each subsequent correct digit doubled the money to a maximum of $4,000. After finding the first bundle of dynamite, the contestant could choose to stop after any correct digit and take the money. Finding the second bundle of dynamite ended the game and forfeited the money.\n* \"Accelerator\" \u2013 A large roulette-style wheel divided into 12 sections was used, with four sections apiece marked \"C,\" \"A,\" and \"R\"; each letter hid a cash amount. The contestant was given two free spins and could win up to three more by ordering four grocery items from lowest to highest price. For each correctly ordered item beyond the first, one more spin was given. After the wheel was set in motion, the contestant rolled a ball down a chute so that it bounced around the wheel and eventually settled into one of the 12 sections. Once the ball settled, the contestant received the cash amount for that space and all instances of that letter were removed to reveal Zonk symbols. After each spin, the contestant could either continue playing or stop and take the accumulated cash. Hitting a Zonk forfeited the money, but the contestant could continue the game if he/she had any spins left. The contestant won a car by hitting all three letters.\n* \"Smash for Cash\" \u2013 The contestant was shown six grocery items, each of which had a [[piggy bank]] associated with it. Five of the items were below a specified target price, and their banks each contained a different number of $1 bills from 1 to 5. The contestant chose an item, whose bank was smashed with a hammer to reveal its contents, and won cash for accumulating different amounts of money ($1,000 for $3; $2,000 for $5; $3,000 for $8; $5,000 for $11; $20,000 for $15). The item which was over the target price had a Zonk symbol in its bank; if the contestant chose this item, the game ended and he/she forfeited all winnings. After choosing any item below the target price, the contestant could choose to stop and keep his/her winnings to that point.\n\nThe following games were exported to ''Let's Make a Deal'', with the prize/item pricing element removed:\n*\"Cliff Hangers\" \u2013 The contestant was presented with three sets of three envelopes and chose one from each set. The mountain climber advanced by the number of steps in the chosen envelope. After three turns, the contestant won a car if the climber had moved a total of 22\u201325 steps, or a medium prize if he had moved 16\u201321 steps. If the climber fell off the mountain or did not move at least 16 steps, the contestant won nothing. After the second turn, the contestant could either accept a cash offer and quit, or take the third turn.\n*\"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 Played for a car, a medium prize, and $500 cash. The contestant tried to sink a putt from each of three distances (closest for $500, intermediate for the medium prize, farthest for the car), and was allowed one miss during the game. After sinking either of the first two putts, the contestant could either end the game and keep that prize, or trade it away for a chance to win the next one. [[Drew Carey]] made a guest appearance to attempt the \"inspiration putt.\" \n*\"Master Key\" \u2013 Two contestants each selected one key and were separately offered $500 not to test them in the three locks. Any prizes won by the first contestant were removed from play for the second.\n*\"Five Price Tags\" \u2013 The contestant watched a clip from a previous playing of the game, then had one chance to choose the price of the car from five similar options. Selecting the correct price awarded $20,000 in cash. Before the price was revealed, the contestant was offered a prize package to quit the game.\n*\"Punch-a-Bunch\" \u2013 Three contestants were chosen, one at a time, to punch out different numbers of holes (one, two, or three, in that order). Before a contestant's punched amount was revealed, he/she had to decide whether to take the total of those amounts or trade the money for a mystery prize.\n*\"3 Strikes\" \u2013 Played as normal, except that numbers were immediately placed on the board as they were drawn. The contestant was given $2,000 at the outset; if a strike was drawn, he/she could either give back half the remaining money and remove it from the bag, or keep the money and leave the strike in play. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any remaining money.\n*\"Dice Game\" \u2013 Played as normal, but the contestant was offered cash to quit the game before each number in the price of the car was revealed.\n*\"Plinko\" \u2013 The contestant was given two chips at the outset, then chose one of three envelopes (held by Wayne, Tiffany, and Jonathan) that held different numbers of chips from one to three. He/she then played one chip at a time on a replica Plinko board, with a potential maximum of $10,000 per chip, and would be offered either cash or a mystery prize to forfeit all winnings and quit the game. First played on ''Let's Make a Deal'' on [[April Fools' Day]] in 2015.\n*\"The Big Wheel\" \u2013 Three contestants each took one spin on a replica Big Wheel, then selected one of three envelopes on three rows concealing a dollar amount that would be multiplied by the value they had spun (e.g., a spin of 55 cents multiplied by $100 would award $5,500). Before the multiplier was revealed, the contestant was given the chance to trade the money for a mystery prize.\n\nFor the 2020 edition of Mash-Up Week, Dice Game, 3 Strikes, the Big Wheel, Plinko and Cliff Hangers were played. Additionally, Drew Carey appeared on the episode in which Plinko was played and substituted for Jonathan.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Come-Down-Behind-Doors-Price/dp/0061350117|last=Blits|first=Stan|title=Come On Down!: Behind the Big Doors at \"The Price Is Right\"|year=2007|publisher=[[HarperCollins#Imprints|It Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|edition=1st|isbn=978-0061350115|page=61}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.priceisright.com official site]\n* [http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_price_is_right/ official site on CBS]\n{{The Price Is Right}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of game shows|Price Is Right]]\n[[Category:The Price Is Right]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Price Is Right'' pricing games}}__NOTOC__\n\n'''Pricing games''' are featured on the current version of the American [[game show]] '''''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'''''. The contestant from [[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)#One Bid|Contestants' Row]] who bids closest to the price of a prize without going over wins the prize and has the chance to win additional prizes or cash in an onstage game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated. Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode. Prior to expanding to one hour in length, three games per episode were played during the half-hour format. With the exception of a single game from early in the show's history, only one contestant at a time is involved in a pricing game.\n\nA total of 110 pricing games have been played on the show, 77 of which are in the current rotation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listing of currently-played games on official website for The Price is Right|url=http://www.priceisright.com/games/|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref> On a typical hour-long episode, two games\u2014one in each half of the show\u2014will be played for a car, at most one game will be played for a cash prize and the other games will offer merchandise or trips. Usually, one of the six games will involve grocery products, while another will involve smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.\n\nSome rules of pricing games have been modified over the years due to the effects of [[inflation]]. On the [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|1994 syndicated version]] hosted by [[Doug Davidson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/daytime/the_young_and_the_restless/bio/doug_davidson/bio.php|title=Doug Davidson: Biography|work=[[CBS|CBS.com]]|publisher=[[CBS]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213171050/http://www.cbs.com/daytime/the_young_and_the_restless/bio/doug_davidson/bio.php|archivedate=February 13, 2009}}</ref> [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)#Pricing game rule changes|the rules of several games were modified]]. Notably, the grocery products used in some games on the daytime version were replaced by small merchandise prizes, generally valued less than $100. Other special series\u2014including ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'' that aired in 2008, and special weeks such as ''Big Money Week'' and ''Dream Car Week''\u2014also [[#Special rule changes|featured temporary rule changes]] to some pricing games. The names of some games are occasionally changed for episodes with specific themes, such as Earth Day, Halloween, and College Day.\n\n{{Compact ToC|name=[[#Active games|Active games]]|center=yes|a=[[#A|A]]|b=[[#B|B]]|c=[[#C|C]]|d=[[#D|D]]|e=[[#E|E]]|f=[[#F|F]]|g=[[#G|G]]|h=[[#H|H]]|i=[[#I|I]]|l=[[#L|L]]|m=[[#M|M]]|n=[[#N|N]]|o=[[#O|O]]|p=[[#P|P]]|r=[[#R|R]]|s=[[#S|S]]|t=[[#T|T]]|custom1=Special rule changes|custom1name=Special rule changes}}\n{{Clear}}\n{{Compact ToC|name=[[#Inactive games|Inactive games]]|center=yes||a=[[#A 2|A]]|b=[[#B 2|B]]|c=[[#C 2|C]]|d=[[#D 2|D]]|f=[[#F 2|F]]|g=[[#G 2|G]]|h=[[#H 2|H]]|i=[[#I 2|I]]|j=[[#J 2|J]]|m=[[#M 2|M]]|o=[[#O 2|O]]|p=[[#P 2|P]]|s=[[#S 2|S]]|t=[[#T 2|T]]}}\n\n==Active games==\n\n===A===\n\n====Any Number====\nA gameboard contains spaces representing five digits in the price of a car, three digits in the price of a smaller prize, and three digits representing an amount of money (less than $10, in dollars and cents) in a piggy bank. The first digit in the price of the car is revealed at the beginning of the game (a rule implemented after cars valued at more than $10,000 were used in the game). The digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the remaining ten spaces, including a duplicate of the first digit in the price of the car. The contestant calls out digits one at a time, revealing them in the prices of the prizes on the gameboard, and wins the first prize whose price is completely revealed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Any Number|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=any-number|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===B===\n\n====Balance Game====\nA prop bag of money representing the last three digits in the price of a prize is placed on one side of a balance scale. The contestant is then shown three more bags, each representing a different value in multiples of $1,000, and must choose two of them to place on that same side so that the total of all three bags equals their guess at the correct price. A bag representing the full price is then placed on the other side of the scale; if the two sides balance, the contestant wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Balance Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=balance-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Bargain Game {{anchor|Barker's Bargain Bar}}====\nTwo prizes are shown, each displaying a bargain price lower than its actual retail price. The contestant wins both prizes by choosing the one that has been marked down farther from retail.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bargain Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bargain-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game was known as ''Barker's Bargain Bar'', named for previous host [[Bob Barker]], until it was removed from rotation on December 5, 2008.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The game returned on April 10, 2012{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} after a hiatus and was renamed ''Bargain Game'', with a new set.\n\n====Bonkers====\nA gameboard displays an incorrect four-digit price for a prize and contains eight spaces: one space above and one space below each digit. The contestant is given four markers to place on the board and has 30 seconds to determine whether each correct digit in the price of the prize is higher or lower than the digit displayed, placing a marker above or below the incorrect digit to denote their choice. The contestant then presses a button. If the guessed pattern is correct, the contestant wins the prize. If the guess is incorrect, a buzzer sounds and the contestant must try again, not knowing how many digits are wrong or which ones. Changes can be made until the contestant finds the right pattern or until time has expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonkers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bonkers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Bonus Game====\nThe contestant is asked whether each of four small prizes is priced higher or lower than the incorrect price given. Each prize corresponds to one of four windows on a gameboard, one of which conceals the word \"Bonus\", and each correct guess wins the small prize and control of the window. The contestant wins a large bonus prize by correctly pricing the small prize with the window containing the word \"Bonus\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonus Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bonus-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Bullseye====\nFive grocery items are shown, and the contestant is asked to purchase a quantity of a single item such that the total price is between $10 and $12. The contestant may make three attempts, each with a different item, and immediately wins the game by succeeding on any one attempt. If the total for an item is between $2 and $10, the host places a marker on a target-shaped gameboard to indicate it. If the total is less than $2 or over $12, no marker is placed.\n\nOne item has a bullseye hidden behind its price tag. If the contestant fails to reach the $10\u2013$12 range on all three attempts, he/she can still win if the hidden bullseye is behind the price tag of an item for which he/she earned a marker on the target.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bullseye|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=bullseye|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the target featured a $5 to $10 range, with $9 to $10 as the bullseye range. Shortly thereafter, the target became $1 to $6, with a $5 to $6 bullseye range.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===C===\n\n====Card Game====\nThe contestant uses [[playing cards]] from a standard deck to bid on a car. Before playing the game, the contestant draws a card from another deck to determine how close their bid must be to the actual price, without going over, in order to win. The contestant's bid starts at $15,000 and increases as the contestant draws cards: face cards add $1,000 and numbered cards add their face value multiplied by $100. Aces are wild and can either be played immediately or held aside. When the contestant chooses to stop drawing cards, the price of the car is revealed. If the bid is within the target range without going over, the contestant wins the car.<ref>{{cite web|title=Card Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=card-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game debuted, no starting bid was given and aces could be made any value up to $1,000. The starting bid increased several times as a result of [[inflation]] to speed up the game: to $2,000 in 1983; $8,000 in 1993; $10,000 in 2001; $12,000 in 2005; and $15,000 in 2008. A rule change added in 2014 allows the game to be played for a luxury car, with the starting bid set at $60,000. Additionally, beginning in 1983 (coinciding with the addition of a starting bid), aces can be made any positive value the contestant chooses.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe special deck has also changed several times. When the game debuted, the deck consisted of nine cards with one each of values from $200 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1983, when the game became ''The New Card Game'', the deck consisted of twelve cards with two each of values from $500 to $1,000 in $100 increments. In 1993, the deck changed again to a deck of twelve cards with three each of values from $500 to $2,000 in $500 increments. In 2005, the deck changed to seven cards, with two each of $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000 values, and one $5,000 card.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Check Game====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and asked to write an amount on an oversized blank check made out in his or her name. The value of the prize is then added to the amount written on the check and if the total falls between $8,000 and $9,000, the contestant wins both the prize and the cash amount of the check. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant receives the check as a souvenir. If he or she loses, the check is first voided with a rubber stamp.<ref>{{cite web|title=Check Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=check-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game was originally titled ''Blank Check'' and had a winning range of $3,000 to $3,500. It was renamed \"Check Game\" in 1986 and the range fell between $5,000 and $6,000 by 1989 and between $7,000 and $8,000 by 2008. The current range went into effect in 2019.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Check-Out====\nThe contestant is asked to individually price five grocery items. After all five guesses are tallied, the actual prices of the items are revealed. If the contestant's cumulative total is within $2.00 of the actual total price of the five grocery items high or low, the contestant wins a bonus prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Check-Out|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=check-out|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game began, the range was 50 cents, then raised to $1 in April 1996, before being raised to the current $2 range in October 2003.\n\n====Cliff Hangers====\nThe contestant faces a gameboard consisting of a mountain slope divided into 25 steps, with a figure of a climber at its base and a cliff at the top. He/she must guess the retail prices of three small prizes, one at a time. The climber moves one step up the slope for every dollar the contestant is off, high or low, and the correct price is not revealed until after the climber has either stopped or fallen off the cliff. If the total of the contestant's errors on all three guesses is no more than $25, he/she wins the three small prizes and a larger prize. If the climber falls off the cliff, the game ends and the contestant wins only the small prizes he/she had priced before the fall occurred.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cliff Hangers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=cliff-hangers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOfficially, the mountain climber has no name, although several hosts have used their own names for him. [[Doug Davidson]] referred to the climber on ''[[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'' as Hans Gudegast, which is the birth name of his ''[[The Young and the Restless|Young and the Restless]]'' co-star [[Eric Braeden]]. [[Drew Carey]] has referred to him as Hans, Yodel Man and most frequently, Yodely Guy. Carey has also referred to this game as \"the Yodely Guy game\". At ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]'', he is often referred to as Johann. [[Dennis James]] referred to the climber as Fritz. On an episode which taped in 1976, after the climber fell off the cliff, James commented, \"There goes Fritz!\", unaware that [[Janice Pennington]]'s then-husband, Fritz Stammberger, had recently disappeared in what had been reported to be a mountain climbing accident at the time. James' offhand comment upset Pennington so much that she remained backstage crying for the rest of the episode.{{sfn|Blits|2007|page=61}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/husbandloverspyt00penn|last1=Pennington|first1=Janice|first2=Carlos|last2=de Abreu|title=Husband, Lover, Spy: A True Story|publisher=Custos Morum Publishers|location=[[Beverly Hills, California]]|year=1994|isbn=978-1884025037|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n====Clock Game====\nThe game is played for three prizes. The actual price of the first prize is shown to the studio and home audiences. After the contestant gives their first bid, a 30-second clock is started and the host tells the contestant whether the actual price is higher or lower than the bid. The contestant continues to bid, responding to the host's clues, until either the contestant wins by correctly guessing the price of the prize or the time expires. If time remains after the first prize is won, the process is repeated for the second prize. If the contestant prices both prizes within 30 seconds, he or she also wins the third prize as a bonus. Unlike other pricing games, the audience is required to remain silent while the contestant is making his or her bids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clock Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=clock-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith few exceptions, the prizes which contestants must price have almost exclusively been valued below $1,000. Prior to the addition of a bonus prize, prizes priced above $1,000 were offered during the game for a brief period from 2008 to 2009. Prizes valued over $1,000 were also offered for a brief period in the 1980s. The contestant was given only the thousands digit in the price and was required to guess the remaining digits in the price.\n\nFrom 1998\u20132014, contestants were awarded a bonus of $1,000 for winning both prizes within 30 seconds.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Coming or Going====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and the numbers in a four-digit price, which are displayed on a shelf.  The shelf can be tilted in two directions (\"coming\" or \"going\"), producing two possible prices, one being the reverse of the other. In order to win the prize the contestant must tilt the shelf in the right direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coming or Going|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=coming-or-going|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Cover Up====\nFive spaces are shown on a gameboard. Above each space are numbers: two above the first space, three above the second space and so on up to six above the fifth space. The contestant is asked to choose a number in each column to create a price for a car. Any correct digits are then lit; the contestant immediately wins the car for having all five correct, or loses for having all of them incorrect. If some of the digits are correct, the contestant covers each incorrect digit with a new choice from its column. The game continues until the contestant either wins by getting all five digits correct, or loses by providing a price in which no new digits are correct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cover Up|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=cover-up|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it does not affect gameplay, until May 23, 2013,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} a false price was initially placed at the start of the game, and the contestant was required to cover up the incorrect digits during his or her first turn. Since June 4, 2013, the false price has been replaced by various items such as certain symbols, the numbers on the false price being turned upside down, humorously altered photos of staff or special themes relating with the episode.\n\n===D===\n\n====Danger Price====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and a \"danger price\", which is the price of one of the prizes. In order to win the game and all four prizes, the contestant must select the three prizes that do not have the same value as the danger price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danger Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=danger-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Dice Game====\nThe game is played for a car with a price that only contains the digits one through six. The first digit of the price is revealed, and the contestant rolls four dice on a gaming table, one at a time. The table has a line painted across its width near the end opposite the contestant, and a die must land entirely across the line in order to count. Each die corresponds to one of the remaining digits in the price. If the contestant rolls the actual digit, it is revealed on a gameboard. Otherwise, he or she must guess whether the correct digit is higher or lower than the one rolled. Any incorrect roll of one or six is defaulted to \"higher\" or \"lower\". The contestant wins the car by guessing correctly on all digits that he or she has not rolled exactly, or by rolling all four digits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dice Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=dice-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1977, the car price occasionally included zeroes or digits higher than six. Until 2007, the contestant was required to state \"higher\" for rolls of one and \"lower\" for rolls of six. Originally, when cars with four-digit prices were offered, the first number was not revealed to start the game. When cars priced above $10,000 were first offered in the 1980s, an extra digit readout was added to the left side of the gameboard for the first number in the price. The game was briefly renamed ''Deluxe Dice Game'' when this change first occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Do the Math====\nA contestant is shown two prizes and the difference in their prices, typically an amount between $800 and $1,200.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do the Math|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=do-the-math|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=6 October 2014| quote=The difference between two prices is $802.|number=6831K}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=10 November 2014| quote=The difference between two prices is $1,129.|number=6891K}}</ref> The contestant must decide whether that amount must be added to or subtracted from the price of the prize on the left to yield the price of the one on the right.

Each row corresponds to one of two prizes and contains a bar that highlights four consecutive digits. Whenever either bar is moved, the other one moves in the same way. The contestant wins both prizes by positioning the bars to highlight the correct prices, reading from upper left to lower right for one and lower left to upper right for the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Cross|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=double-cross|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Double Prices====\nThe contestant is shown two possible prices for a prize, one of which is correct. The contestant wins the prize if he or she chooses the correct price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Prices|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=double-prices|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwo prizes were offered in early episodes of the 1970s syndicated edition hosted by [[Dennis James]]. Regardless of whether or not the contestant won the first prize, the contestant could win a second prize by choosing the correct price from a different set of two possibilities.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===E===\n\n====Easy as 1 2 3 {{anchor|Easy as 1 2 3}}====\nThe contestant is given three blocks marked \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\", which are used to rank three prizes from least expensive to most expensive. The contestant wins everything by correctly ranking all three items.<ref>{{cite web|title=Easy as 1 2 3|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=easy-as-1-2-3|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===F===\n\n====Five Price Tags====\nThe contestant is briefly shown five price tags, one of which is the correct price of a car. Four small prizes are then presented; for each one, the contestant must guess whether its displayed price is \"true\" (correct) or \"false\" (incorrect). Each correct guess wins that prize and one choice from the five price tags. After playing through all four prizes, the tags are brought out again and the contestant wins the car by selecting the correct price before running out of choices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Price Tags|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=five-price-tags|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> If the contestant guesses all four small prizes incorrectly, the game ends.\n\n====Flip Flop====\nA gameboard displays four digits in the price of a prize arranged in pairs (e.g., 12|34) on two panels. At least one of the pairs of digits needs to be reversed. The contestant may \"flip\" the first pair ($'''2,1'''34), \"flop\" the second pair ($1,2'''43'''), or \"flip flop\" both pairs ($'''2,143'''). The contestant wins the prize by making the correct choice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flip Flop|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=flip-flop|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Freeze Frame====\nA ring of eight tiles, each with a two-digit number, rotates clockwise through a frame at the top of a gameboard. Two of the tiles appear in the frame at a time, forming a four-digit price. The contestant pulls a lever to stop the ring from moving when he or she believes the price within the frame is the price of the prize. If the contestant guesses the price correctly, he or she wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freeze Frame|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=freeze-frame|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===G===\n\n====Gas Money====\nThe contestant is shown five prices for a car. One at a time, the contestant selects the four prices he or she believes to be incorrect. Each successful choice wins one of four different cash amounts hidden behind the prices ($1,000, $2,000, $3,000, or $4,000). After each guess, the contestant may choose to either stop and keep any cash won, or risk what has already been won by selecting another price. If the contestant successfully guesses all four incorrect prices, he or she wins the car and $10,000. If the contestant guesses the correct price at any time, the game ends and the contestant loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gas Money|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=gas-money|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to June 19, 2009,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} contestants had to select what they believed to be the actual price of the car before attempting to eliminate the other four incorrect prices.\n\n====Golden Road====\nThree prizes are presented, the first and second of which have three- and four-digit prices. The final prize is often billed as one of \"the most expensive single prizes offered on the show\", with a price consisting of five (or occasionally six) digits. Since 2008, the final prize is usually a premium European sports or luxury car, although premium American sports cars are also offered, especially for patriotically-themed episodes. The hundreds digit is missing from the price of each prize, and the digits in the prices of the first two prizes do not repeat.\n\nThe contestant is shown the price of a grocery item worth less than $1 and is then asked which of the two unique digits in its price belongs in the price of the first prize. If correct, the three digits in that price are used to select the missing digit for the second prize. If the contestant prices the second prize correctly, the four numbers in its price are used to select the missing digit for the final prize. If the contestant makes an incorrect choice at any time, the game ends but he or she wins any correctly priced prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Road|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=golden-road|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Grand Game====\nThe contestant is shown a target price and six grocery items, four of which are priced below the target price. One at a time, the contestant selects items he believes are priced lower than the target. The contestant's winnings start at $1 and are multiplied by ten for each correct selection, to $10, $100 and $1,000. A contestant who makes an incorrect guess prior to reaching the $1,000 level keeps whatever money is accumulated to that point. After reaching the $1,000 level, the contestant may choose to quit the game and keep his or her winnings or to risk that money in order to attempt to select the one remaining product priced lower than the target. A correct final choice wins the maximum of $10,000. However, if the final item the contestant selects is one of the two above the target price, the contestant loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=grand-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Gridlock! {{anchor|Gridlock}}====\nThe contestant is shown a row of seven model cars, the leftmost of which displays the first digit in the actual price of a car. The remaining six (three blue, followed by three red) each display a pair of digits. The contestant selects the blue car that he/she believes shows the second and third digits in the actual price. If the choice is correct, the contestant then tries to select the correct last two digits from among the red cars. The contestant wins the car by completing its price. Selecting one incorrect pair of digits allows the contestant to choose again from the remaining two cars in that group, but a second mistake ends the game.\n\n====Grocery Game====\nThe contestant is shown five grocery items and asked to purchase quantities of them to total between $20 and $22. The contestant can purchase any quantity of any item, but may not use any item more than once. After the contestant selects an item, its price is revealed and multiplied by the quantity, then added to the contestant's running total on a cash register. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins a prize. The game is lost if the contestant's total exceeds $22 or he or she exhausts all five items before reaching $20.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grocery Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=grocery-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1989, the original total range was $6.75 to $7. From 1989 through 2016,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=6 October 2016 |season=45 |number=14 |language=English}}</ref> the winning range was $20 to $21. The first four times the game was played, the contestant received $100 at the start of the game, which he or she kept if he or she won, chose to stop before exceeding $7, or lost without exceeding $7. The contestant also received supplies of the five items in each of those four games. The quantities varied but always totaled at least $100 and counted toward the contestant's winnings.\n\n===H===\n\n===={{1/2}} Off {{anchor|Half Off}}====\nA $10,000 cash prize is hidden in one of 16 boxes. The contestant is presented with three pairs of small prizes. Within each pair, one prize is correctly priced and the other has had its price cut in half. Each time the contestant selects a half-price prize, he or she wins that pair of prizes and half of the remaining boxes are eliminated, leaving the winning box still in play. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to select that box and win the $10,000. Guessing correctly on all three pairs awards a $1,000 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome.<ref>{{cite web|title=1/2 Off|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=half-off|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the episode which aired October 19, 2007,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=19 October 2007|season=36 |number=4055K}}</ref> the rules were modified to award the contestant $500 in addition to the two smaller prizes for each pair correctly priced, for a total of $1,500. Beginning September 28, 2010,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=28 September 2010 |season=36 |number=5242K}}</ref> the $500 per-pair bonus was removed. Instead, contestants now win a $1,000 bonus for correctly pricing all three pairs of items. Under both formats, the contestant keeps the bonus money even if he or she does not win the grand prize.\n\n====Hi Lo====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose the three with the highest prices in order to win. These items' prices are placed in the \"Hi\" row of the gameboard, and the lowest price in that row is kept and the others discarded before the other three items' prices are revealed and placed in the \"Lo\" row. The contestant wins if all three of the prices are lower than the remaining \"Hi\" price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hi Lo|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=hi-lo|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game's history, the contestant was asked whether each individual item's price belonged in the \"Hi\" row or the \"Lo\" row. The contestant either won the game by correctly placing each of the six prices or lost by making a mistake.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Hole in One (or Two) {{anchor|Hole in One}}====\nThe contestant must putt a golf ball into a hole (similar to [[miniature golf]]) in order to win a car. The putting green has six white lines painted across its width, and the contestant begins at the one farthest from the hole. He or she is asked to put six grocery items in ascending order of price. For every successive price that is higher than the one before it, the contestant moves one line closer to the hole. Correctly ordering all six items awards a $500 bonus, which the contestant keeps regardless of the outcome. If the contestant misses the putt, the host reveals the full name of the game as \"Hole in One or Two\" and he or she is given a second chance to make the putt from the same line.\n\nPrior to the contestant's first attempt, the host usually takes an \"inspiration putt\" from the farthest line to demonstrate the use of the putter, although a model or golf-involved guest will occasionally perform this instead.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hole in One (or Two)|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=hole-in-one|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUntil October 10, 1986,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the contestant was allowed only one putt to win the car. The game's name became ''Hole in One or Two'' when the second-putt rule was instituted. \n\n====Hot Seat{{anchor|Hot Seat}}====\nFive small prizes are displayed onstage, arranged on a row of pedestals, and the contestant sits in a chair that moves automatically from one to the next. As the contestant reaches each prize, an incorrect price is revealed and he/she must press one of two buttons to guess whether the true price is higher or lower. The contestant has 35 seconds to make all five guesses. If time runs out, any prizes the contestant has not reached are taken out of play.\n\nThe contestant is told that all of his/her correct guesses will be revealed first, and the chair moves to one of the five prizes. If the contestant's guess on this prize is correct, he/she wins the prize and $500. Successive correct guesses increase the winnings to $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, and finally $20,000. After the chair has moved to the next item, the contestant may choose to stop before the price is revealed and keep all money won to that point, but if an incorrect guess is revealed, the game ends, and the contestant loses everything; however, they keep any small prizes won to that point.\n\n===I===\n\n====It's in the Bag====\nThe contestant is shown a series of five grocery bags, with a price tag on each one indicating the retail price of a grocery item in the bag. Six grocery items are then shown: five of the six items correspond to the items in the bags, while the sixth item does not match any of the displayed prices. One at a time, the contestant must match up the grocery items with their prices. After all five choices have been made, the host reveals the price of each item. If the item in the bag matches the one the contestant chose, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and must decide whether or not to continue to the next level or quit with the money he or she has already won. If the contestant chooses to continue and an incorrect match is revealed, the game ends and he or she loses everything. The first correct match wins $1,000, and each successive correct match doubles the contestant's winnings ($2,000, $4,000, $8,000 and $16,000).<ref>{{cite web|title=It's in the Bag|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=its-in-the-bag|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===L===\n\n====Let 'em Roll====\nThis game, loosely based on the dice game [[yacht (dice game)|yacht]], is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $7,500. It uses five large dice, each marked with an image of a car on three sides and cash values of $500, $1,000 and $1,500 on the other three. The contestant is given one roll of the dice and can earn up to two more using three grocery products. The price of the first item is given, and the contestant must determine whether the price of each of the next two items is higher or lower than the one preceding it.\n\nIn order to win the car, the contestant must roll a car on all five dice within their allotted number of rolls. All dice that display cars are taken out of play after each roll. At any point, the contestant can elect to take the sum of the cash values on the remaining dice and quit; contestants who use all of their rolls without winning the car automatically receive the total of the displayed values on their final roll.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let 'em Roll|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=let-em-roll|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Line 'em Up====\nLine 'em Up is played for a car and three other prizes. The contestant is shown the first and last digits of the car's price. Two of the smaller prizes each have a three-digit price and one has a two-digit price. In order to win the car and the prizes, the contestant must line up the three prices in a frame to display a price for the car. If the guess is correct, the contestant wins everything. Otherwise, the contestant is told how many of the digits are correctly placed\u2014but not specifically which ones\u2014and the contestant then makes a second guess. The contestant wins nothing if he or she guesses incorrectly on the second attempt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Line 'em Up|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=line-em-up|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Lucky Seven {{anchor|Lucky $even}}====\nThe contestant is given seven $1 bills and shown the first digit in the price of a car. The contestant guesses the remaining digits in the price, one at a time, losing $1 for each digit of difference between their guess and the correct digit. If the contestant has at least $1 remaining after all digits are played, he or she wins the car (using $1 to buy it), plus any additional money not used in the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucky $even|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=lucky-seven|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, all cars appearing in this game were priced under $10,000 and no free digits were revealed. When cars priced above $10,000 began to regularly appear, the free digit rule varied: on six special episodes which aired in prime time during the summer of 1986, the last digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game and the contestant had to guess the first four digits. Later that year on the daytime show, the contestant was offered the first digit and was required to guess the last four digits in the price.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nOn November 5, 2009,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} to celebrate the show's 7,000th episode, the game used seven stacks of $1,000 instead of the usual seven $1 bills. During that episode, the contestant needed at least $1,000 to buy the car, and kept any remaining money if he or she won the car.\n\n===M===\n\n====Magic #====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes and told which one has the higher price. He or she then pulls a lever to adjust a \"magic number\" on a display so that it falls between the two prices. The contestant wins both prizes by setting the number correctly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic #|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=magic-#|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Make Your Move====\nThe contestant is shown a sequence of nine digits on a gameboard which include, consecutively but in unknown order, the prices of three prizes: one of each with a two-, three- and four-digit price. Three sliding markers are set underneath the digits, one for each prize. In order to win everything, the contestant must correctly position the markers under the corresponding prices, using each digit once without overlapping.<ref>{{cite web|title=Make Your Move|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=make-your-move|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor a brief time in October 1990, a second prize with a three-digit price replaced the prize with a two-digit price. Under these rules, one of the numbers on the board appeared in the price of two prizes, requiring the sliders to overlap.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Master Key====\nA car and two additional prizes are each represented by a giant lock. The contestant is shown two small prizes, each displaying a string of three digits, and must decide whether the first two or last two digits make up the correct price. For example, a prize showing \"357\" has a price of either $35 or $57. Each time the contestant chooses a correct price, he or she wins that prize and selects one key from a rack of five. Three of the keys correspond to one prize lock each, one will open none of the locks, and one (the \"Master Key\") opens all three. If the contestant earns any keys, he or she tries them in the locks and wins any prizes he or she is able to unlock. If a key opens the first lock (or the second one if the first has already been opened), the contestant is then directed to try it in the third lock to see if it is the Master Key.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master Key|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=master-key|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Money Game====\nThe contestant is shown a board of nine two-digit numbers, two of which are the first and last two digits in the price of a car. The middle digit is revealed at the outset, and the contestant chooses one number at a time. The correct numbers hide the front and rear halves of the car, while all others hide dollar signs. Any incorrect numbers chosen by the contestant are placed into a column of four blank spaces and awarded as cash. If the contestant completes the price before filling the column, he/she wins both the car and the sum of the incorrect guesses; if the column is filled first, he/she wins only the cash total.<ref>{{cite web|title=Money Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=money-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the game was first played for cars with a five-digit price, the game was titled ''Big Money Game''. For cars with four-digit prices, no digit in the price was revealed at the start of the game. Also, on the [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]]-hosted syndicated version in 1985, the contestant was shown the last digit in a five-digit price, meaning the contestant had to find the third and fourth digits in addition to the first two.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====More or Less====\nThe game is played for a car and three additional prizes. The contestant is shown an incorrect price for the first prize and is asked to guess whether its actual price is more or less than the one displayed. If the contestant is correct, he or she wins that prize and moves on to the next one, with the car as the last prize. A mistake at any point ends the game, but the contestant keeps any prizes correctly priced up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|title=More or Less|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=more-or-less|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Most Expensive====\nThe contestant is shown three prizes and must choose which is the most expensive in order to win everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Expensive|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=most-empensive|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===N===\n\n====Now....or Then {{anchor|Now or Then|Now and Then}}====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items, each marked with a price, arranged on a circular gameboard. The gameboard also shows a month and year, usually from the past eight to twelve years. The contestant selects an item and must determine whether the price given for the item is the current price (now) or the price as of the specified past date (then). To win the game and a large prize, the contestant must make correct guesses for three adjacent wedges of the circle. The game ends if incorrect guesses make it impossible to claim three adjacent wedges.<ref>{{cite web|title=Now....or Then|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=now-or-then|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to December 2, 1986,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the original name of the game was ''Now....and Then''. The name was changed to reflect the decision made by the contestants.\n\n===O===\n\n====One Away====\nThe contestant is shown an incorrect price for a car. Each of the individual digits displayed is either one digit higher or one digit lower than the correct digit in the price. The contestant adjusts each digit and wins the car if they have correctly chosen all five. If all five digits are wrong, the contestant automatically loses the game. Otherwise, he or she is told the total number of digits correctly placed, but not specifically which ones and is given an opportunity to make the necessary changes. The actual price of the car is then revealed and the contestant wins if their guess matches the price.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Away|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=one-away|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====One Right Price====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes and a price corresponding to one of them.

Two prices are correct and one is incorrect. The contestant wins everything by choosing the prize with the incorrect price.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Wrong Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=one-wrong-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===P===\n\n====Pass the Buck====\nThe game is played for a car and/or a cash prize of up to $9,000. The contestant is shown a board with six numbered spaces. Behind the numbers are one space marked with an image of a car, two spaces marked \"Lose Everything,\" and three spaces marked with cash values: $1,000, $3,000 and $5,000. The contestant is given one choice of a space at the start of the game and can earn two more.\n\nThe contestant is shown two pairs of grocery items. Within each pair, one item is correctly priced, while the other has had its price reduced by $1. Each time the contestant correctly chooses a reduced-price item, he or she wins another choice from the board. The contestant then chooses one number at a time and can quit after any turn, keeping everything he or she has won to that point. Otherwise, the game ends when all choices have been used. Finding a \"Lose Everything\" space forfeits the accumulated winnings, but the contestant may continue to play if he or she still has any choices left.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pass the Buck|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pass-the-buck|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game's history, the board had eight spaces instead of six, a third \"Lose Everything\" space and a $2,000 cash award, and the maximum cash amount that could have been won without winning the car was $10,000. Additionally, the contestant was not given a free choice at the start of the game. Instead, a third pair of grocery items (for a total of six items) was used to earn a third choice. During this period, the game ended immediately if the contestant failed to win a choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Pathfinder====\nThe game is played for a car. The gameboard features a five-by-five floor grid of 25 digits, on which the contestant must walk a five-step path to spell out the price of the car in order to win it. The contestant begins in the center square, which contains the first digit, and every correct square is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the one before it. Diagonal steps, backtracking, and stepping onto already-used squares are not allowed. If the contestant steps onto an incorrect digit at any time, he or she must back up to the last correct digit and earn a second chance by pricing one of three smaller prizes. The contestant chooses a prize and must choose the correct price from two options. If the contestant succeeds, he or she wins that prize and another chance to choose the next correct digit in the car's price. If the contestant fails to choose the correct price, he or she may try to win another second chance with a different prize. If the contestant steps on an incorrect digit with no small prizes remaining or guesses the incorrect price for the third small prize, the game ends.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pathfinder|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pathfinder|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game originally offered cars with four-digit prices and an asterisk was on the center square. Contestants had to step onto all four digits without being given a free digit.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Pay the Rent====\nThis game is played using six grocery items and offers a top prize of $100,000.<ref name=\"Pay the Rent\">{{cite web|title=Pay the Rent|url=http://www.priceisright.com/show/games/pay-the-rent|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> The main prop is a house with two stories, an attic, and a mailbox. The first and second stories each have space to hold two grocery items, while the attic and mailbox can each hold only one. The contestant is asked to arrange the grocery items in the house so that the total price of the item(s) on any level is higher than the total for the previous one, starting at the mailbox and working upward toward the attic.\n\nThe contestant immediately receives $1,000 and the item prices are revealed, one level at a time. His or her winnings are increased each time that the total for a level is higher than the previous one: $5,000 for the first story, $10,000 for the second story, and $100,000 for the attic. The contestant may choose to stop the game at any time and keep all money won to that point. However, if a level total is lower than the previous one, the game ends and the contestant forfeits everything.\n\n====Pick-a-Number {{anchor|Pick a Number}}====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and its price with one digit missing. The contestant wins the prize by correctly selecting the missing digit from three possible choices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pick-a-Number|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pick-a-number|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Pick-a-Pair {{anchor|Pick a Pair}}====\nThe contestant is shown six grocery items and must choose two whose prices are equal in order to win.

The six items form three pairs of equal price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pick-a-Pair|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pick-a-pair|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Plinko====\nPlinko is played for up to $50,000. The contestant is given one free chip and can win up to four more by pricing smaller prizes. For each prize, the contestant is shown a price and must choose which digit of two displayed\u2014the first or the second\u2014is correct. The contestant wins the small prize and an extra chip for choosing the correct digit. After pricing all of the items, the contestant places one chip at a time on a pegboard (styled similarly to a [[bean machine]]), where it eventually falls into one of nine spaces at the bottom. The values of these spaces are arranged symmetrically. From the outside in, the sequence is $100\u2013$500\u2013$1,000\u2013$0, with the middle space worth $10,000. Once the chip falls into a space, the contestant wins the corresponding amount of money and the chip is removed from the board. If a chip becomes stuck on the board, it is knocked loose and returned to the contestant to drop again. The process is repeated until the supply of chips is exhausted, and the contestant wins the total amount of all spaces hit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plinko|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=plinko|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPlinko debuted as a pricing game in January 1983.<ref>{{cite web |first= Wade |last= Sheridan |date= May 26, 2017 |title= 'Price is Right' contestant wins record $31.5K playing Plinko |url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2017/05/26/Price-is-Right-contestant-wins-record-315K-playing-Plinko/3001495793756/ |publisher= UPI |accessdate= July 28, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the center space was worth $5,000, with a potential top prize of $25,000.\n\n====Pocket Change====\nThe game is played for a car. The contestant begins the game with $0.25, which is given as the car's initial selling price. Six digits are shown, five of which belong to the price of the car. The first digit in the price is revealed, and the contestant attempts to guess the remaining four digits, one at a time. Each incorrect choice raises the car's selling price by $0.25. When a digit is correctly chosen, it is removed from play and the contestant selects one of 20 envelopes from a gameboard without opening it. Each envelope contains a value between $0.00 and $2.00.\n\nAfter the contestant correctly guesses the fifth digit and selects a final envelope, the envelopes (four in all) are opened and the values inside are added to the initial bank of $0.25. If the bank total meets or exceeds the car's selling price, the contestant wins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pocket Change|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=pocket-change|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first time the game was played, the contestant was not given the first digit and was required to guess all five digits in the price, resulting in five envelopes to be added to the initial $0.25.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Punch-a-Bunch====\nThe game is played for a top prize of $25,000. The contestant answers higher-or-lower pricing questions about four items, one at a time. Each correct answer earns a punch on a 5-by-10 [[punchboard]]. The contestant punches holes into the appropriate number of spaces on the board, each of which contains a slip of paper with an amount of money written on it. The host then reveals the amount written on each slip, one at a time, beginning with the first hole punched. One hole contains the $25,000 prize, while the others contain amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. The contestant may either accept the amount on the slip and end the game, or discard it in favor of the next hole he/she punched. The game continues until the contestant either quits, wins the top prize, or reaches the last of their slips, in which case he or she must keep the last amount.\n\nPrior to September 29, 2011,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} four slips displayed both a cash amount and the message \"Second Chance.\" Finding one allowed the contestant to punch another hole immediately, and the value inside was added to the one on the Second Chance slip. While this rule was in effect, a contestant could win more than the top prize amount by finding it on a Second Chance punch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punch-a-Bunch|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=punch-a-bunch|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe top prize from September 27, 1978{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} to October 1, 2008{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} was $10,000, with $50 as the lowest amount on the board.\n\nAlthough the same pricing method was used to earn punches, the first 11 playings of Punch-a-Bunch used a different cash distribution and punch format. Each of the letters in the word \"PUNCHBOARD\" concealed a different number, with two each of 1 through 4 and one each of 5 and 10. After punching one of the letters, the contestant punched a hole in the field of 50 holes on the board. Twenty of the holes contained slips marked \"Dollars\", another 20 contained slips marked \"Hundred\" and the remaining 10 contained slips marked \"Thousand\". The number punched was multiplied by the phrase on the slip to determine the contestant's award (e.g., punching a ten and the word \"Thousand\" earned the contestant $10,000).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Push Over====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and a series of nine numbered blocks which includes the correct price. A blue window, four blocks wide, is positioned at the far right end of a shelf, beyond which is a bin. The contestant wins the prize by pushing the entire row of blocks until the correct price is shown in the window. However, once blocks fall over the edge into the bin, they cannot be retrieved. This game has occasionally been played for cars and other prizes valued over $10,000, using a window wide enough to display a five-digit price.<ref>{{cite web|title=Push Over|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=push-over|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===R===\n\n====Race Game====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and given a set of tags with their prices. The contestant then has 45 seconds to match the prices with the correct prizes. To see how many he or she has correct, the contestant pulls a lever on a display which then lights up the number of correctly-placed tags. If the contestant has fewer than four right, he or she may rearrange the prices and pull the lever as often as time allows. Once time runs out, the contestant wins any prizes he or she has correctly priced at that point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=race-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Range Game====\nA $600 range for the price of a prize is displayed as a vertical scale. A $150 range finder moves up the scale, starting from the bottom, and the contestant has one opportunity to stop it by pressing a button. If the range finder is covering the correct price when stopped, the contestant wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Range Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=range-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original range was $50, but it was quickly increased to $100. The range was $200 for a brief period during the 1970s on the syndicated version of the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Rat Race====\nThe contestant must price three items within specified ranges: a grocery item priced under $10 within $1; a small prize priced under $100 within $10; and a medium prize priced under $500 within $100. For each bid given within the correct range, the contestant chooses one of five colored mechanical rats (yellow, green, pink, orange and blue), which are positioned on a large dollar sign-shaped racetrack. The rats are then set in motion on the track and all five rats ultimately travel the same distance. The contestant wins a car, a large prize, or an additional medium-valued prize if a chosen rat finishes first, second, or third. More than one prize can be won, depending upon the number of rats chosen and how they finish the race.<ref name=\"rat race\">{{cite web|title=Rat Race|work=Price Is Right|url=http://www.priceisright.com/show/games/rat-race|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===S===\n\n====Safe Crackers====\nThe contestant attempts to win two prizes by guessing the three-digit combination of a giant safe that contains both prizes. The combination is the same as the price of the less expensive prize. The contestant is given the three unique digits and must use each of them only once to determine the correct price in order to open the safe and win both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safe Crackers|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=safe-crackers|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Secret \"X\" {{anchor|Secret X}}====\nThis game is played on a giant [[tic-tac-toe]] board with a secret X hidden in the center column. At the start of the game, the contestant is given one free X to place anywhere in either the left or right column of the board. Two small prizes are then shown, each with two possible prices. Each time the contestant correctly prices a prize, he or she wins it and receives another X. After placing the additional X's, the secret X is revealed. The contestant wins the game and a large prize if he or she has formed a line of three either horizontally or diagonally. If the contestant earns no additional X's, the game ends immediately. Contestants cannot win the game by placing all three of their X's on the same column to create a vertical line; a winning line must include the secret X.<ref>{{cite web|title=Secret \"X\"|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=secret-x|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Shell Game====\nPlayed similarly to the [[Shell game|carnival game of the same name]], the game features four shells, one of which conceals a ball. The contestant is asked whether each of four prizes is actually priced higher or lower than a given incorrect price. For each correct guess, the contestant wins that small prize and a chip to place beside one of the shells. If the contestant places a chip beside the shell containing the ball, he or she wins a bonus prize. A contestant who correctly prices all four items automatically wins the prize, and can also win a cash amount equal to the prize value by correctly guessing which shell conceals the ball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shell Game|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=shell-game|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode | series = The Price is Right | network = CBS | number = 5282K | airdate = 26 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, this bonus was $500 on the daytime show, and $1,000 on the 1970s syndicated version. On the 1985\u201386 syndicated version, the bonus was originally $500, then $1,000. Eventually, it was awarded for correctly pricing all four items, without having to select the right shell.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Shopping Spree====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and chooses three of them, one at a time. If the total of their prices exceeds a given minimum amount, he or she wins everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shopping Spree|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=shopping-spree|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Side by Side====\nThis game is played for prize with a four-digit price. The contestant is shown a pair of two-digit numbers and must decide the order in which they should be placed to form the correct price (e.g. \"75\" and 42\" can give options of $7,542 and $4,275). If the contestant chooses correctly, he/she wins the prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side by Side|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=side-by-side|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spelling Bee====\nThe game is played for a car or a cash prize of up to $5,000. A gameboard contains 30 cards: eleven Cs, eleven As, six Rs, and two \"CAR\"s. In order to win the car, the contestant must choose either one of each letter or a CAR card. The contestant chooses two free cards from the board and may win up to three more by pricing each of three small prizes within $10 of their actual prices, high or low. If the contestant guesses any price exactly, he/she automatically wins all three prizes and cards, even if he/she had missed on previous guesses. After the cards are chosen, the contestant is offered $1,000 per card to quit the game and walk away. The cards are revealed one at a time. If the car is not yet won, the cash buyout offer is repeated with the remaining cards. The contestant wins nothing if he or she fails to spell CAR or get one of the two CAR cards after the last card is revealed. If the contestant does win the car, however, he or she does not receive cash for any remaining cards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spelling Bee|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=spelling-bee|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2007, each card was worth $500, for a maximum buyout of $2,500.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} \n\n====Squeeze Play====\nThe contestant is shown a prize and a price that has had one incorrect digit inserted; the first and last digits are always correct. To win the prize, the contestant must remove the extra middle digit to leave behind the correct price. This game has been played for prizes with four- and five-digit prices, giving the contestant a choice between three and four middle digits, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squeeze Play|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=sqeeze-play|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Stack the Deck====\nThe game is played for a car. The contestant is shown seven playing cards containing digits, five of which make up the price of the car. Three pairs of grocery items are displayed, and the contestant must guess which item in each pair corresponds to a given price. Each correct guess allows him/her to fill in one correct digit in the price of the car. After all three pairs have been played, the contestant has one chance to win the car by correctly filling in all remaining digits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stack the Deck|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=stack-the-deck|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Swap Meet====\nThe contestant is shown a base prize and three more prizes. In order to win all four, he or she must \"swap\" the base prize by choosing the prize from the group of three whose price is the same as the base prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swap Meet|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=swap-meet|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Switch? {{anchor|Switch}}====\nThe contestant is shown two prizes, each with a price. The contestant must decide whether the prices are correct as shown or need to be switched with each other. A correct decision wins both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Switch?|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=switch|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Switcheroo====\nThis game is played for a car and four additional prizes under $100. The contestant is shown the prices for the five prizes, each of which is missing its tens digit, and given five blocks with the missing digits. The contestant has 30 seconds to complete the prices using these blocks. After either the time limit expires or the contestant is satisfied, the number of correct prices is revealed, but not specifically which ones. If all five prices are correct, the contestant immediately wins everything. If fewer than five are correct, he or she may take another 30 seconds to change the prices if desired, or leave them as they are. The extra time is given by default if none of the prices are correct. Once the game ends, due to the contestant either using the extra 30 seconds or leaving the prices alone, he/she wins all prizes that are correctly priced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Switcheroo|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=switcheroo|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===T===\n\n====Take Two====\nThe contestant is shown four prizes and a target total. He or she has two chances to win everything by choosing the two whose prices match the total when added together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Take Two|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=take-two|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Temptation====\nThe contestant is shown the first digit in the price of a car and is then presented with four additional prizes, each of which has only two distinct digits in its price. As each prize is presented, the contestant selects one digit from its price to fill in the price of the car. After the last prize is shown, he or she is given a chance to change any digits and must then make another choice: take the four prizes and quit the game, or risk them and try for the car. If the contestant tries for the car and has the correct price, he or she wins everything. If any digits are incorrect, he or she loses everything.<ref>{{cite web|title=Temptation|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=temptation|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, when the game was played for cars with four-digit prices, the first digit was not given. Also, early playings of the game included prizes with three different digits in their prices as well as prizes with two-digit prices. In addition, when the game debuted, contestants were not given the option to change any digits after making their initial selections.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====10 Chances====\nThe contestant is given ten chances to correctly price three prizes. The first has a two-digit price, the second a three-digit price, and the third is a car. The contestant is given three unique digits for the first prize and must guess the price using two of them. The process repeats for the second prize, with four digits given to the contestant. For the car, the contestant is given five digits and must use all of them to guess its price. No digit may be repeated in any guess. The game ostensibly includes a ten-second time limit for writing down each choice, though this is rarely enforced. The contestant wins any prizes that he or she has correctly priced after all ten chances are used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Chances|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=ten-chances|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the game used cars with four digits in the price and the contestant had to use four of the five available digits in each guess.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====That's Too Much====\nThe contestant is shown up to ten prices for a car in ascending order, one at a time. The contestant wins the car by correctly identifying the first revealed price which is higher than the actual price by calling out \"That's Too Much!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=That's Too Much|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=thats-too-much|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====3 Strikes====\nThe contestant is shown eight baseballs: five marked with digits in the price of a car and three \"strike\" balls marked with an X. The balls are placed into a hopper and mixed, and the contestant blindly draws one ball at a time. If a digit is drawn, the contestant must guess where it belongs in the price. If correct, the digit appears in that position on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. If incorrect, the ball is returned to the hopper without penalty. If a strike is drawn, an X is lit up in the strike display on the gameboard and the ball is removed from play. To win the car, the contestant must fill in every digit before drawing all three strikes.<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Strikes|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=three-strikes|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2018, discs were used rather than baseballs, and they were placed in a bag rather than a hopper. When the game began in 1976, there were seven discs in the bag: the four digits of the price and the three strikes. As the value of cars went past $10,000 in the mid-1980s, the game was briefly known as ''3 Strikes +'' when cars priced above $10,000 were first offered. Since 1993, the game has been played for vehicles priced at least $30,000, typically luxury vehicles, premium trucks, or electric cars. Since 2013, cars priced above $100,000 have occasionally been offered; in these playings, a sixth disc or ball with the extra digit is used.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2008, only one strike chip was used, and it was returned to the bag after being drawn. The contestant lost by drawing the strike chip three times. During a brief period during Season 37 (2008), the first digit in the price was lit at the beginning of the game, with chips representing the remaining four digits plus the three strike chips placed in the bag.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Time Is Money====\nThe contestant is shown five grocery items that must be placed on tables with specific price ranges: $0 to $2.99, $3 to $5.99, and $6 and higher. The contestant is given ten seconds and one chance to place all five items in their proper categories. Doing so correctly awards $20,000. If the contestant fails to place them correctly, he or she is given 40 seconds to make changes, with the potential prize decreasing steadily at a rate of $500 per second. The contestant may rearrange items as often as time permits, and must press a button after each attempt to learn the result. If he or she places the items correctly, the clock is stopped and he or she wins any remaining money. The contestant is never told how many items or which ones are correctly placed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Is Money|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=time-is-money|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> The revamped game premiered on September 22, 2014.<ref>{{cite episode|series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=22 September 2014 |season=43 |number=6811K }}</ref> \n\nUnder the original rules the game was played for a large prize and $500 instead of $20,000 cash. The contestant had 15 seconds to correctly group all of the items. If the contestant was correct, he or she also won $500 in addition to the prize. If unsuccessful, the contestant could stop playing and keep the $500, or exchange it for another 15 seconds to regroup the items, without knowing how many items were incorrectly placed or which ones. After two playings, the rules were changed to remove the $500 bonus and offer the contestant two chances to correctly place the items, with a 20-second time limit for each chance. If any were placed incorrectly after the first chance, the contestant was told how many items were incorrectly placed (although not specifically which individual products were placed correctly). If the contestant was incorrect on the second chance, the game ended and he or she won nothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Triple Play====\nTriple Play is the only game to regularly offer three cars. The contestant is shown two price choices for the first car, three for the second and four for the third. For each car, the contestant must choose which of the displayed prices is closest to the actual price of the car without going over. The contestant may not stop the game after correctly pricing the first or second car. If the contestant chooses correctly for all three cars, he or she wins everything. If the contestant chooses incorrectly at any point, the game ends and he or she wins nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Triple Play|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=triple=play|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====2 for the Price of 1====\nThe game is played for two prizes, one of which has three digits in its price. The contestant must select which of two digits displayed is the correct digit in each position of the price. The contestant is offered a free digit of his or her choice and then selects which of the remaining digits are correct. If the contestant correctly determines the price, he or she wins both prizes.<ref>{{cite web|title=2 for the Price of 1|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=two-for-the-price-of-one|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===V===\n\n====Vend-O-Price====\nThree grocery items are displayed on separate shelves of a gameboard resembling a [[vending machine]], from top to bottom in increasing order of price.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Price Is Right |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=25 September 2015 |season=44 |number=7215K}}</ref> The contestant inserts a coin into the machine, and the shelves' sliding doors open to reveal a different quantity of each item. In order to win, the contestant must choose the shelf with the highest total price, based on the price for one unit multiplied by the number of items on its shelf.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vend-O-Price|url=http://www.priceisright.com/game-page/?id=vend-o-price|work=Price Is Right|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Inactive games==\nWhen the 1972 version of the show premiered, many games did not have official names which were used on the air. Some of the names below are unofficial or assigned by the production staff.\n\n===A===\n\n====Add 'Em Up====\nThe contestant was shown a car whose price contained four unique digits and was told their sum. He/she chose one digit to be revealed and had to guess the other three, one at a time and in any order. The total of all correctly guessed digits was shown on the gameboard. In order to win the car, the contestant had to guess all of the missing digits before making two mistakes.\n\n===B===\n\n====Balance Game{{anchor|Balance Game 1984}}====\nFive small prizes were presented and the contestant was given five \"Barker silver dollar\" coins. The contestant attempted to balance a scale with a combination of prizes added to each side. The contestant chose one prize at a time and assigned it to either the left or right side of the scale. Coins representing the value of the prize were placed on the side selected. If the totals of the prizes on both sides matched at any time, the contestant won a larger prize package. If the totals agreed to within $5, he or she could use the provided coins to balance the scale and win. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any prizes he or she chose during the game as well as any unused coins.\n\n====Bullseye{{anchor|Bullseye 1972}}====\nThe contestant was given seven chances to guess the actual price of a car. In response to each guess, the host told the contestant whether the actual price was higher or lower. In some appearances of the game, the contestant was given a $500 range into which the price fell.\n\n====Bump====\nThe contestant was shown two prizes and a British-themed gameboard containing four double-decker buses, each marked with a price. The far left and far right buses displayed the same price, and the prizes' names were placed below the two middle buses. A model stood at each end of the row, and the contestant chose one of them to bump the buses, resulting in either the leftmost or rightmost two coming to rest above the prize names and the others being removed/knocked from the board. The contestant won both prizes if the buses' prices matched those of the prizes below them.\n\n====Buy or Sell====\nThree prizes were shown, each with an incorrect price. The contestant bought prizes he or she believed were under-priced and sold prizes he or she believed were overpriced. The actual prices were then revealed, one at a time. For each correct decision, the difference between the two prices was added to a bank. For each incorrect decision, the difference was subtracted from the bank. If the contestant had a positive bank balance at the end of the game, he/she won everything as well as any money accumulated in the bank. The most money that could be accumulated was $1,900. Prior to 1997, winning contestants did not receive any money accumulated.\n\n===C===\n\n====Clearance Sale====\nThree prizes were shown and the contestant was given three price tags, each of which bore a sale price lower than one of the items' actual retail price. The contestant placed a price tag on each prize and won everything if each of the sale prices was below the actual price of its respective prize.\n\n====Credit Card====\nFive prizes were shown, each usually worth between $200 and $3,000. The contestant was then presented with a large [[credit card]], which was inserted into an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], which then displayed a credit limit (usually $1,800 to $2,500). The contestant then chose three prizes, one at a time, and their prices were deducted from the credit limit. If the contestant did not exceed the limit with the three choices, he/she won everything.\n\n===D===\n\n====Double Bullseye====\n\nThe original Bullseye game was reworked into a two-player format after never producing a winner. In doing so, the game became the only pricing game which guaranteed a winner. After the first contestant won his or her way on stage, another contestant was called from the audience, and another item went up for bids. After the second contestant won his or her way on stage, the car was shown.  Barker asked each one to give him a bid on the price of the car after giving a price range of $500. He then told the opponent whether the price was higher or lower than the bid, and the two alternated until one gave the exact price, winning the car.\n\nAustralia's version of ''The Price is Right'' used this format for their Showcase round. Hosts [[Ian Turpie]] or [[Larry Emdur]] gave a price range and asked the two contestants to bid in the same manner. Whoever gave the exact price won the opportunity to play for the showcase.\n\n====Double Digits====\nA car was shown along with four small prizes. For each small prize, the contestant was shown the second digit in that prize's price, and then two possibilities for the first digit. The contestant attempted to select the correct first digit in the price, which also corresponded to a digit in the car's price. If the four correct digits had been chosen, the contestant won everything. If the contestant failed to win the car, he or she still won any small prizes which were priced correctly.\n\n===F===\n\n====Finish Line====\nSix small prizes were described in three pairs. For each pair, the contestant tried to pick the more expensive item. The sum of the prices of the rejected prizes made up a finish line that a miniature horse and jockey would have to cross. After all three choices were made, the horse moved one step for each dollar in the total value of the prizes the contestant had selected. If the horse passed the finish line, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept the three chosen prizes.\n\n====Fortune Hunter====\nFortune Hunter was played for four prizes and $5,000. It involved four boxes, one of which contained the cash prize. The host read three clues to help the contestant eliminate the prizes associated with them, based on their prices. The remaining box was then opened. If the cash was hidden inside, the contestant won everything. However, if the chosen box was empty, the contestant won nothing.\n\nThe contestant did not have to eliminate the prizes in the order the clues were read. The prizes could be eliminated in any order, as long as only the box that contained the money was left.\n\n===G===\n\n====Gallery Game====\nA painting of a prize was shown to the contestant. Below the painting was a price, which was missing part of one digit. The contestant won by correctly painting in that digit.\n\n====Give or Keep====\nSix small prizes were presented in three pairs. From each pair, the contestant picked what he believed was the more expensive prize. If the sum of the prices of the prizes the contestant kept was equal to or greater than the sum of the prices of the prizes they gave away, the contestant won a larger prize. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant won the three prizes they chose to keep.\n\n===H===\n\n====Hit Me====\nThe contestant played [[blackjack]] against the house, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting). Before the game began, the contestant cut a deck of oversized playing cards and two were dealt out as the house's starting hand, the first one face down as a hole card. The contestant was then shown six grocery items, each of which displayed a price that was equal to its actual price multiplied by a whole number from 1 to 10. Each item had a card hidden underneath it, whose value was equal to that item's multiplier. One of the six items displayed its actual price and would give an ace if chosen, while another showed a price multiplied by 10. Aces could count as 1 or 11.\n\nThe contestant chose items and received their cards until he or she either reached a total of 21, busted, or chose to stop. Reaching 21 with any combination of cards was an automatic win, regardless of the house's hand. If the contestant stopped, the house's hole card was revealed and, if necessary, additional cards were dealt from the deck until its total reached 17 or higher. The contestant won if his or her total matched or exceeded the house's total without busting, or if the house busted. If the contestant busted, he or she immediately lost the game.\n\nSituations involving an ace in the house's hand (whether it should be counted as one or eleven even when the result would be in favor of the house) were handled inconsistently over the course of the game's time on the show.\n\n====Hurdles====\nA grocery item was described, and its price was attached to a runner figure on a gameboard. The contestant was shown three pairs of items and asked to choose the one in each pair that he/she believed was lower in price than the base item; each choice was marked with a blue flag. Once he/she had made all three choices, a starter's pistol was fired and the runner began to move across the board, with a hurdle rising from each chosen item as he approached it. If the contestant chose correctly, the hurdle would stop rising in time for the runner to clear it. If the runner cleared all three hurdles, the contestant won the game and a large prize. However, if the contestant chose incorrectly at any point, the runner would crash into that item's hurdle and the game ended.\n\n===I===\n\n====It's Optional====\nTwo cars were shown, each of the same make and model. The contestant was told the second car was priced a set amount higher than the first and told the difference in the two prices, then shown a list of a list of nine options. Selecting options one at a time, the contestant attempted to increase the price of the first car to within $100 of the price of the second car without going over. The number of options a contestant was allowed to choose during the course of the game changed each time it was played but was generally between three and five.\n\n===J===\n\n====Joker====\nThe contestant was shown a hand of five face-down cards, one of which was a joker. Four small prizes were presented, each with a displayed price. For each one, the contestant had to decide whether or not to reverse the digits in order to obtain the correct price (e.g. $37 or $73). Each correct choice awarded that prize and allowed the contestant to discard one card from the hand. He/she won the game if the joker was found among the discards.\n\n===M===\n\n====Make Your Mark {{anchor|Barker's Markers}}====\nThree prizes were shown along with four prices on a gameboard. The contestant was given $500 and chose the three prices he/she believed were correct, using a marker to note each selection. Two correct prices were revealed among the three marked ones and matched to their prizes, and the contestant then had to decide whether to leave the last marker where it was, or return the $500 and switch the marker to the one un-chosen price. If the contestant chose correctly, he/she won all three prizes and kept the $500 if he/she had not returned it. If the third choice was incorrect, the contestant won nothing. \n\nThe game was originally titled ''Barker's Markers'' in reference to former host [[Bob Barker]], but was re-titled ''Make Your Mark'' after Drew Carey took over as host and during the game's single appearance on the [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|1994 syndicated version]] hosted by Doug Davidson.\n\nOn the October 9, 2008 episode,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right|network=CBS |date=9 October 2008 |season=37 |number=4464K}}</ref> the only playing of Make Your Mark in season 37, [[Drew Carey]] incorrectly explained the rules that the contestant was allowed to keep the $500 regardless of whether or not they ultimately won the game, so long as they did not change the last marker.\n\n====Mystery Price====\nA prize package was presented to the contestant and the price of the least expensive item in the package was dubbed the \"mystery price\". Four smaller prizes were shown individually and the contestant placed a bid on each of them. If their bid was equal to or lower than the item's actual price, the contestant won that prize and the amount of their bid was placed into a bank. If the contestant overbid on the prize, it was lost and no value was added to the bank.\n\nAfter all four small prizes were played, the mystery price was revealed. The contestant won the larger prize package in addition to any small prizes they did not overbid on if the bank was equal to or greater than the mystery price.\n\n===O===\n\n====On the Nose====\nIn order to win a car, the contestant competed in one of five possible sporting events. The events varied each time the game was played and included throwing a baseball or football into a specified area, shooting a basketball into a hoop, hitting a tennis ball with a racket into a specified area or popping a balloon with a dart.\n\nAfter being shown the car, the contestant was presented with four possible prices. The contestant selected the one they believed was the actual price of the car and, if correct, won a $1,000 bonus and four attempts at the sporting event preselected for that day. The further away the selected price was from the actual price, the fewer attempts at the sporting event the contestant received with no bonus. If the contestant succeeded in the sporting event, he or she won the car.\n\n====On the Spot====\nSix small prizes were described and the contestant was shown three paths, colored blue, yellow and pink, extending outward from a center black spot. Each path was marked with three prices. To win a car, the contestant attempted to match the three prices in any path to the six prizes in play. After choosing a path, the contestant had to correctly determine which prize was associated with each price along the path in turn. If the contestant made a mistake, they returned to the center spot and chose a new path. Making mistakes on all three paths ended the game. The contestant won any prizes he/she correctly priced.\n\nSome of the prices on a path were repeated on other paths, and the contestant could automatically step to the next price along the path if he or she had already correctly matched the associated prize on a previous path.\n\n===P===\n\n====Penny Ante====\nTwo grocery items were described. For each item, four possible prices were presented. The contestant was given three oversized pennies and attempted to select the correct price for each item, one at a time. Each mistake the contestant made cost him or her a penny. The contestant won a larger prize if he or she was able to guess the actual price of both items before losing all three pennies.\n\nThe first five times the game was played, the board was not divided into halves for each grocery item. Instead, the two correct prices were hidden among all eight choices. Whenever an incorrect price was guessed, one penny fell from the side of the gameboard into a bucket for each cent in the amount of the guess. A scoreboard was attached to the front of the gameboard, which kept track of the pennies accumulated. The contestant lost the game if the total of the incorrect guesses made before finding the two correct prices equaled 100 pennies or more.\n\n====The Phone Home Game====\nThe contestant and a preselected home viewer competing via telephone teamed to attempt to win up to $15,000. Before the game began, the home viewer was given a list of the actual prices for each of seven grocery items. The items were then described to the contestant and the home viewer gave a price for one of the items. The contestant selected the item he or she believed matched that price. If the contestant was correct, the team shared a hidden cash award associated with that specific product. If the contestant was incorrect, both the guessed product and the correct product were removed from play and their cash awards were lost. The contestant and home viewer attempted to make three correct matches and win three cash awards. If the home viewer read the name of a grocery item at any time instead of a price, that turn was lost.\n\nThe cash awards for the matched products were revealed and the team split the total amount won. The cash awards hidden beside the seven products included one each of $10,000, $3,000, and $2,000, and two each of $1,000 and $200.\n\n====Poker Game====\nFour prizes were shown, all with three-digit prices. The contestant selected two of the prizes and the digits in their prices were used to form the best possible five-card poker hand, with nines high and zeroes low. After the hand was revealed, the contestant chose either to keep it or pass it to the house. The prices of the other two prizes were then revealed and assembled into a second poker hand. If the contestant had a better hand than the house, he or she won everything.\n\nThe hand rankings were similar to those of poker and were, from highest to lowest: five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card. However, straights did not count, and without suits, flushes were not possible.\n\nIn early playings, the contestant was allowed to make their hand with any five of the six digits of the prices of the two prizes they had chosen, but did not have the option to pass their chosen hand to the house.\n\n====Professor Price====\nThe last two digits in the price of a car were revealed, and the contestant was asked a series of general knowledge questions with single-digit numerical answers. (Example: \"How many ounces are there in half a pound?\" \u2013 answer: 8.) After each question, the contestant had to guess whether that digit was one of the first two in the price. If it was, it was revealed whether the contestant guessed correctly or not. The contestant won the car for giving three correct answers/guesses, or lost for missing three.\n\nA large animatronic puppet known as Professor Price was central to the game. The contestant's progress was tracked by the puppet's hands, with correct answers/guesses counted by upward-pointing fingers on the right hand and incorrect ones counted by downward-pointing fingers on the left. As with the Clock Game, the audience was required to remain silent while the game was in progress.\n\nThe game was played only twice, making it the shortest-lived game in the show's history. It was also the only game to have a perfect record, having been won both times it was played.\n\n===S===\n\n====Shower Game====\nThe contestant was shown six shower stalls, each marked with a possible price for a car. Three stalls contained confetti, two contained $100 in one-dollar bills, and the one with the actual price contained a giant car key. The contestant entered a stall and pulled its chain, triggering the release of its contents. Finding confetti allowed him or her to choose again. As soon as the contestant found either the $100 or the car, the game ended and he or she won that prize.\n\n====Split Decision====\nA car and a medium prize were shown and a string of eight digits was displayed on a gameboard. The numbers in the prices of the prizes appeared in order but were not necessarily placed side by side. The contestant was given 20 seconds to pull down the three digits that made up the price of the smaller prize, leaving the five digits that made up the price of the car. To stop the clock, the contestant pushed a button on the gameboard. If the correct three-digit price for the smaller prize had been pulled down, the contestant won both prizes. If incorrect, the contestant continued guessing until a correct guess was made or time ran out.\n\nA later variation in the rules did not feature a clock. Instead, the contestant was given only three chances to win.\n\n====Step Up====\nThe contestant had a chance to win up to four prizes and $3,000 cash. He/she selected one prize, whose price was immediately revealed, then attempted to choose a more expensive one. A correct choice awarded both prizes and $500, after which the contestant could either stop the game or try to choose a still more expensive prize. If this choice was correct, he/she also won the third prize and an additional $1,000 and had the same choice to stop or continue. If the contestant continued, and the last prize was the most expensive of all, he/she won it as well and an additional $1,500. However, an incorrect guess at any time ended the game and the contestant lost everything.\n\n====Super Ball!!====\nThe contestant had a chance to win up to three large prizes by rolling balls up a [[skee ball]] ramp. The ball for each large prize was presented alongside a small prize displaying two possible prices. If the contestant chose the correct price, he/she won that small prize and earned the corresponding ball. The ramp contained three rings: $50 and $100, which awarded those cash amounts, and WIN, which awarded the large prize for that ball. The contestant was given a practice ball to roll before attempting to win any of the large prizes.\n\nA fourth small prize was then revealed. If the contestant priced it correctly, he/she won it and earned a \"Super Ball.\" Rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring awarded all three large prizes, while rolling it into either cash ring awarded triple the marked value. If the contestant had already won all three large prizes, he/she could earn a $3,000 bonus by rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring.\n\n====Super Saver====\nSix grocery items were presented, five marked below their actual retail price and one marked above. The contestant chose four of the items, one at a time, and the difference between the marked price and the actual price was added to a bank. Choosing the overpriced item deducted that difference from the bank. The contestant won the game by saving a total of at least $1 after the four choices. Even if the overpriced item was chosen, it was always mathematically possible to win the game by selecting three products with the largest differences below the actual prices. Also, the contestant was required to choose four items even if the bank total exceeded $1 after the first two or three selections.\n\n===T===\n\n====Telephone Game====\nA car and two smaller prizes were shown, along with four grocery items. The contestant was given $1 to purchase two of the four grocery items, attempting to spend no more than 90\u00a2 so that he or she would have a dime left in order to use a pay telephone. If the contestant succeeded, he or she dialed one of three given four-digit telephone numbers and won the prize whose price was associated with that number, indicated by a model answering the telephone placed next to it. The number for the car represented its price in dollars, while the numbers for the two small prizes represented their prices in dollars and cents. The contestant won nothing if their grocery item purchase exceeded 90\u00a2.\n\n====Trader Bob====\nThe contestant was presented with one small prize and was then shown three pairs of additional prizes. By choosing one prize from each pair in the order they were presented, the contestant attempted to \"trade up\" from that initial prize and create a sequence of four prizes in ascending order of price. If the contestant successfully traded up with all three choices, he or she won both the last small prize chosen and a larger prize package. If not, the contestant won only the first small prize chosen that was lower in price than the one before it.\n\n===W===\n\n====Walk of Fame====\nThe contestant could win up to four prizes by guessing their prices within a set range, high or low. The prizes were presented in order of increasing value, and the winning range increased from one to the next. If the contestant missed on any of the first three prizes, he/she was given a choice of two autograph books signed by the show's cast. One book also contained a page marked \"Second Chance\". If the contestant chose this book, he/she moved on to the next prize, but the one he/she had missed was taken out of play. The game ended once the contestant made a second mistake, failed to choose the \"Second Chance\" book, or made a mistake on the fourth prize.\n\n==Special rule changes==\nRules to certain pricing games have occasionally been changed on special episodes. \n\n=== 1986 summer specials ===\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 After winning both prizes the contestant blindly chose a cash bonus from one of four envelopes with possible values of $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 and $5,000.\n* \"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000.\n\n=== 2002\u201308 prime time specials ===\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 The bonus for winning both prizes within 30 seconds was increased to $5,000.\n* \"Grand Game\" \u2013 The top prize was increased to $20,000, with the winnings ranging from $2, $20, $200, and $2,000.\n* \"1/2 Off\" \u2013 The top prize was increased to $25,000.\n* \"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 The bonus for correctly ordering all six items was $1,000.\n* \"It's In the Bag\" \u2013 The last bag's value was increased to $24,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n* \"Plinko\" \u2013 The game was played for $100,000, with the middle slot increased to $20,000.\n* \"Punch a Bunch\" \u2013 The top prize was originally $25,000, then later increased to $50,000.\nDuring episodes of ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'', contestants had an opportunity to win the $1 million bonus in the showcase showdown for spinning a $1.00 in their bonus spin.  If no contestant earned a bonus spin in either showcase showdown, the ultimate winner of the showcase would be given the opportunity to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus.  If no contestant earned a bonus spin and both contestants overbid in the showcase, a new contestant would be called from the audience at the end of the show to spin the big wheel for a $1 million bonus; this was later changed to allow the contestant who made the smaller overbid to spin.\n\n===''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular''===\nIn 2008, episodes of ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'' featured rule changes to some pricing games which awarded a $1 million bonus to the contestant for achieving specific goals.\n* \"Clock Game\" \u2013 The contestant was required to guess the retail prices of both prizes within a total of 10 seconds to win the bonus. Winning both prizes awarded $5,000 regardless of how much time was left on the clock.\n* \"Cover Up\", \"One Away\" \u2013 The contestant was required to guess all five digits in the car's price correctly on his/her first attempt to win the bonus.\n* \"1/2 Off\" \u2013 A contestant who found the $25,000 could either quit or risk it for a chance at the bonus. A $1 million check was hidden in one of the other 15 boxes, and the contestant had one chance to guess where it was. An incorrect guess forfeited the $25,000.\n* \"Plinko\" \u2013 If at least three chips landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant was given a golden Plinko chip. If the golden chip landed in the $20,000 slot, the contestant won the bonus. Otherwise, the contestant won the money amount associated with where the chip landed.\n* \"Punch a Bunch\" \u2013 The contestant could win the bonus by finding the $50,000 prize with their first punch.\n* \"Range Game\" \u2013 After stopping the range finder, the contestant provided a guess for the exact price of the prize. If the correct price fell within the $150 range, the contestant won the prize. If their exact guess matched the actual retail price of the prize, the contestant also won the bonus.\n* \"Safe Crackers\" \u2013 After winning the game under the standard rules, the contestant could quit with the prizes won (one of which was always a car) or risk them to try for the bonus. The safe was re-locked with a new five-digit combination that was the same as the price of the car. Each dial contained the same five digits. However, each digit did not necessarily appear in the price of the car, and the contestant was told the price of the car could potentially contain repeated digits. Setting the correct combination won the bonus, while an incorrect combination forfeited everything.\n* \"Switcheroo\" \u2013 The contestant could win the bonus by correctly pricing all five prizes within the initial 30 seconds.\n\n===Specially-themed episodes===\nStarting in 2012, rule changes were also made to some pricing games for episodes with special themes, mostly Big Money Week, Dream Car Week, or episodes where viewers could choose game options via Twitter. The changes were as follows:\n\n* \"Bonkers\" \u2013 During Big Money Week, contestants that win the game also win $1,000 for each second remaining on the clock.\n* \"Bonus Game\" \u2013 During the 2017 Dream Car Week, both a car and a prize are offered for winning the game.

On the November 14, 2014 episode, prizes of $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000 were offered, with a perfect game totaling $175,000.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right|network=CBS |date=10 November 2014 |season=43 |number=6891K}}</ref> \n** On February 16, 2015, during a [[Twitter]]-themed episode, viewers voted Rat Race over Grand Game as the $100,000 game, and prizes offered were $75,000, $15,000 and $10,000 for win, place and show.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right|network=CBS |date=16 February 2015 |season=43 |number=6922K}}</ref>\n* \"Shell Game\" \u2013 During Big Money Week, a cash prize of $50,000 is offered for winning the game. If the contestant automatically wins the game by correctly pricing all four smaller prizes, the contestant has a chance to win another $50,000 by selecting the shell with the ball inside.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=12 October 2015 |season=44 |number=7243K}}</ref>\n* \"Spelling Bee\" \u2013 During Dream Car Week in 2016, 2019 and 2020, and during Big Money Week in 2018, each card was worth $5,000, for a maximum buyout of $25,000. In the Big Money instance, the letters C, A, R, and \"CAR\" cards were replaced with B, I, G, and \"BIG\" cards, and was played for $100,000 instead of a car.\n* \"Time Is Money\" \u2013 During Big Money Week, the top prize is increased to $200,000. Correspondingly, the prize available decreases by $5,000 per second if the contestant does not place all five products correctly on his or her first try.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right|network=CBS |date=12 November 2014 |season=43 |number=6893K}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, theme weeks also had several changes:\n*During the Big Money Week:\n**In season 44's Big Money Week aired in October 2015, any contestant who won their game received an additional bonus of $5,000, and the prize for spinning $1.00 during a contestant's bonus spin in the [[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)#Showcase Showdown|Showcase Showdown]] was increased from $25,000 to $50,000.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Price Is Right |network=CBS |date=12 October 2015 |season=44 |number=7243K}}</ref> \n**In season 45's Big Money Week in October 2016, the 45-cent space on the wheel was colored in green and was worth $45,000 if it was hit in a bonus spin, and later in Season 46, the bonus award for bonus spin were doubled (i.e. green spaces are worth $20,000 and the $1.00 is worth $50,000), and winning a Pricing Game (except for games played with cash) would win an additional $5,000 bonus. \n**In season 47's Big Money Week, contestants winning a Pricing Game (except for games played with cash) would win cash based on the prize's monetary value.\n**In season 48's Big Money Week, the monetary value of all non-cash winnings from the pricing games they won will accumulate in a progressive jackpot, which was won by the winner of their showcase for the day. \n*Some Dream Car Week Showcase Showdowns (since Season 43) replaced the $25,000 bonus spin prize with a car. \n*In weeks sponsored by [[Publishers Clearing House]], the contestant who won the day's first pricing game was awarded $20,000.\n*Three celebrity charity Weeks have aired, in 2012, 2013, and 2017. A different celebrity appeared on each episode to assist the contestants in their pricing games, and the show donated enough money to the celebrity's favorite charity to match the total winnings of all contestants. In addition, the celebrity spun the Big Wheel once during the second Showcase Showdown, and the result was multiplied by 100 and added to the donation (e.g. a spin of 60 cents added $6,000).\n*During the Premiere weeks since Season 46:\n**In Season 46 (in conjunction with Drew Carey's 10th anniversary as host), a contestant could win $10,000 for spinning a dollar during the Showcase Showdown; in the premiere episode (aired September 18, 2017), while pricing game winners wins an additional $10,000 bonus, spinning $1.00 in the bonus spin also awards the contestant a $100,000 bonus.\n**During Season 47's Premiere episode (aired September 17, 2018), in honour on the [[45th Daytime Emmy Awards|eighth]] ''[[Daytime Emmy Award]]'' win for the [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]], the bonus for spinning $1.00 before the bonus spin was increased to $8,000, while landing on the $1.00 in the bonus spin was increased to $80,000.\n**During the first week of Season 48 (September 23 to September 27, 2019), the first contestant to win a pricing game on each episode received a bonus prize in addition to his/her other winnings.\n*During the 9,000th milestone episode (aired October 10, 2019), contestants winning a Pricing Game won a $9,000 bonus. During the episode's showcase showdown, the $1.00 bonus before the bonus spin was increased to $9,000.\n\n===Mash-up Week===\nFor each episode which aired during the week of May 9, 2016 and March 23, 2020, one of the games from ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' was imported to ''The Price is Right'' and played as a pricing game. The rules were modified slightly to require the contestants to price items.\n\n* \"Car Pong\" \u2013 The contestant was shown four small prizes, one of which was priced at a stated amount, and tried to pick the other three, one at a time. Each correct choice added five seconds to a base time of five seconds, but an incorrect choice revealed a Zonk and ended this phase of the game immediately. The contestant then stood at one end of a table and tried to bounce ping-pong balls into a set of nine cups arranged in a diamond formation at the other end, using the accumulated time (a maximum of 20 seconds). Landing a ball in the center cup won a car; the other eight cups awarded cash amounts of $250, $500, or $1,000.\n* \"Go for a Spin\" \u2013 A wheel divided into 16 sections was used, with a car symbol in one section, Zonks in five others, and cash amounts from $100 to $5,000 in the remaining ten. The contestant was shown three small prizes and had to choose the correct price for each from two options. Each correct choice allowed the contestant to replace one Zonk with a car symbol. The contestant could then either accept $500 per correct choice and end the game, or spin the wheel once and win the prize on which it stopped: cash, a car, or nothing for a Zonk.\n* \"Gold Rush\" \u2013 The contestant was shown seven numbered boxes, five of which corresponded to digits in the price of a car (indicated by a mine cart full of gold). The other two held bundles of dynamite. The contestant had to select all five correct digits in any order to win the car. The contestant won $500 for the first correct digit chosen, and each subsequent correct digit doubled the money to a maximum of $4,000. After finding the first bundle of dynamite, the contestant could choose to stop after any correct digit and take the money. Finding the second bundle of dynamite ended the game and forfeited the money.\n* \"Accelerator\" \u2013 A large roulette-style wheel divided into 12 sections was used, with four sections apiece marked \"C,\" \"A,\" and \"R\"; each letter hid a cash amount. The contestant was given two free spins and could win up to three more by ordering four grocery items from lowest to highest price. For each correctly ordered item beyond the first, one more spin was given. After the wheel was set in motion, the contestant rolled a ball down a chute so that it bounced around the wheel and eventually settled into one of the 12 sections. Once the ball settled, the contestant received the cash amount for that space and all instances of that letter were removed to reveal Zonk symbols. After each spin, the contestant could either continue playing or stop and take the accumulated cash. Hitting a Zonk forfeited the money, but the contestant could continue the game if he/she had any spins left. The contestant won a car by hitting all three letters.\n* \"Smash for Cash\" \u2013 The contestant was shown six grocery items, each of which had a [[piggy bank]] associated with it. Five of the items were below a specified target price, and their banks each contained a different number of $1 bills from 1 to 5. The contestant chose an item, whose bank was smashed with a hammer to reveal its contents, and won cash for accumulating different amounts of money ($1,000 for $3; $2,000 for $5; $3,000 for $8; $5,000 for $11; $20,000 for $15). The item which was over the target price had a Zonk symbol in its bank; if the contestant chose this item, the game ended and he/she forfeited all winnings. After choosing any item below the target price, the contestant could choose to stop and keep his/her winnings to that point.\n\nThe following games were exported to ''Let's Make a Deal'', with the prize/item pricing element removed:\n*\"Cliff Hangers\" \u2013 The contestant was presented with three sets of three envelopes and chose one from each set. The mountain climber advanced by the number of steps in the chosen envelope. After three turns, the contestant won a car if the climber had moved a total of 22\u201325 steps, or a medium prize if he had moved 16\u201321 steps. If the climber fell off the mountain or did not move at least 16 steps, the contestant won nothing. After the second turn, the contestant could either accept a cash offer and quit, or take the third turn.\n*\"Hole in One (or Two)\" \u2013 Played for a car, a medium prize, and $500 cash. The contestant tried to sink a putt from each of three distances (closest for $500, intermediate for the medium prize, farthest for the car), and was allowed one miss during the game. After sinking either of the first two putts, the contestant could either end the game and keep that prize, or trade it away for a chance to win the next one. [[Drew Carey]] made a guest appearance to attempt the \"inspiration putt.\" \n*\"Master Key\" \u2013 Two contestants each selected one key and were separately offered $500 not to test them in the three locks. Any prizes won by the first contestant were removed from play for the second.\n*\"Five Price Tags\" \u2013 The contestant watched a clip from a previous playing of the game, then had one chance to choose the price of the car from five similar options. Selecting the correct price awarded $20,000 in cash. Before the price was revealed, the contestant was offered a prize package to quit the game.\n*\"Punch-a-Bunch\" \u2013 Three contestants were chosen, one at a time, to punch out different numbers of holes (one, two, or three, in that order). Before a contestant's punched amount was revealed, he/she had to decide whether to take the total of those amounts or trade the money for a mystery prize.\n*\"3 Strikes\" \u2013 Played as normal, except that numbers were immediately placed on the board as they were drawn. The contestant was given $2,000 at the outset; if a strike was drawn, he/she could either give back half the remaining money and remove it from the bag, or keep the money and leave the strike in play. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant kept any remaining money.\n*\"Dice Game\" \u2013 Played as normal, but the contestant was offered cash to quit the game before each number in the price of the car was revealed.\n*\"Plinko\" \u2013 The contestant was given two chips at the outset, then chose one of three envelopes (held by Wayne, Tiffany, and Jonathan) that held different numbers of chips from one to three. He/she then played one chip at a time on a replica Plinko board, with a potential maximum of $10,000 per chip, and would be offered either cash or a mystery prize to forfeit all winnings and quit the game. First played on ''Let's Make a Deal'' on [[April Fools' Day]] in 2015.\n*\"The Big Wheel\" \u2013 Three contestants each took one spin on a replica Big Wheel, then selected one of three envelopes on three rows concealing a dollar amount that would be multiplied by the value they had spun (e.g., a spin of 55 cents multiplied by $100 would award $5,500). Before the multiplier was revealed, the contestant was given the chance to trade the money for a mystery prize.\n\nFor the 2020 edition of Mash-Up Week, Dice Game, 3 Strikes, the Big Wheel, Plinko and Cliff Hangers were played. Additionally, Drew Carey appeared on the episode in which Plinko was played and substituted for Jonathan.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Come-Down-Behind-Doors-Price/dp/0061350117|last=Blits|first=Stan|title=Come On Down!: Behind the Big Doors at \"The Price Is Right\"|year=2007|publisher=[[HarperCollins#Imprints|It Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|edition=1st|isbn=978-0061350115|page=61}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.priceisright.com official site]\n* [http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_price_is_right/ official site on CBS]\n{{The Price Is Right}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of game shows|Price Is Right]]\n[[Category:The Price Is Right]]\n", "name_user": "Hadykuzailil", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCliff Hangers)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Price_Is_Right_pricing_games"}

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\n== Legal background ==\nThe doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] is the right of a government not to be sued in its own courts.<ref name=\"Baude p. 4\">{{bluebook journal|last=Baude|first=William|title=Sovereign immunity and the constitutional text|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26400233|year=2017|journal=Va.

More recently, the principle has been defended for a variety of reasons: the idea that the entire community, i.e. the state, cannot commit wrongdoing; that the state's actions are lawful ''per se''; that an agent of the state, when acting unlawfully, necessarily does so outside of their legal authority;{{refn|group=n|Government officers have long been amenable to suit without the government's immunity.{{r|Baude p. 4}}}} opposition to the use of public funds to compensate private injuries; and that being amenable to suits interferes with the state's operation.<ref name=\"Olenick p.1493\">{{bluebook journal|last=Olenick|first=Donald|title=Sovereign immunity in sister-state courts: Full Faith and Credit and federal common law solutions|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122173|year=1980|journal=Colum.

Congress could only appoint courts dealing with [[piracy]], felonies on [[international waters]] and appeals in cases of [[Rule of capture|capture]]. They could also establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals for dealing with disputes between two or more states and disputes with individuals claiming certain land based on different grants of two or more states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 9\">Jacobs, at 9.</ref> However, various states had accumulated large debts with domestic and foreign creditors, largely due to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Confederate government's and some states' failure to pay its creditors was seen as an obstacle to harmony and peace. Some feared that the failure to repay foreign governments and its subjects posed an international threat. In addition, because the domestic creditors were largely concentrated in a few states, people feared that states [[default (finance)|defaulting]] on their debt would cause interstate tension. The legacy of these concerns can be recognized in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], which extended the judicial power of the United States to cases between a state and foreign nationals or citizens of other states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 8-9\">Jacobs, at 8-9.</ref>\n\n''[[Chisholm v.

Hall'' ===\nThe issue of interstate sovereign immunity remained unaddressed by the U.S. Supreme Court until ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]'' (1979). Prior to ''Nevada v. Hall'', courts had generally ruled that the Constitution, at least implicitely, prevented states from being sued in the courts of other states, pursuant to the principle of sovereign immunity.{{refn|group=n|For example, {{cite court|litigants=Paulus v.

Hall'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a case where two [[California]] residents were severly injured after their car collided with a car that was the property of the [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] on a highway in California. The car was being operated by a [[University of Nevada]] employee on official business. The California residents brought suit against the University, the State of Nevada, and the car's administrator in a [[California Superior Court]]. The Superior Court rejected Nevada's argument that they were immune from suits against them in sister-state courts without their consent and held that it did have [[jurisdiction]] over the case. The Superior Court also rejected Nevada's argument that the Court, in keeping with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], should apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against the state to $25,000 per tort.{{Refn|In 1979, this was raised to $50,000 per tort.{{r|Olenick p. 1495}}|group=n}} Instead, the Superior Court awarded the plaintiffs $1,150,000 in damages. The judgement was affirmed by a [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] and the [[Supreme Court of California]] declined to hear the case.<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495\">Olenick, at 1495.</ref>\n\nNevada petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted ''[[certiorari]]''. The opinion of the Court was authored by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], in which the Court held that the Constitution, specifically Article III and the Eleventh Amendment, did not prevent states from being sued in the courts of sister-states. It also held that California was not required to apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against its state, because California had a substantial interest in allowing persons injured while driving on their highways to receive full compensation when they sued the responsible person(s) in their courts. In addition, Stevens noted that this interest was also furthered by the fact that California had waived its own immunity and allowed for full compensation in cases where the State of California was the defendant. Thus, applying the Nevada tort limit \"would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over nonresident motorists and full recovery.\"<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495-96\">Olenick, at 1495-96.</ref><ref name=\"Decision Nev. v. Hall\">{{ussc|name=Nevada v. Hall|volume=440|page=410|year=1979}}.</ref> In his dissenting opinion, Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] argued that interstate sovereign immunity was found \"not in an express provision of the Constitution but in a guarantee that is implied as an essential component of [[federalism]].\"{{r|Decision Nev. v. Hall}} He also argued that this decision would cause states to refuse to recognize each others' immunity in retaliation, and that states would move assets out of other states, in an attempt to safeguard itself from liability, which would damage the federal system.<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1496-97\">Olenick, at 1496-97.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhen Gilbert P.

The [[California Franchise Tax Board]] completed an audit in 1993 of Hyatt's tax returns, and determined that Hyatt's primary residence was actually California in 1991 and 1992; the FTB assessed Hyatt $13.3 million in back taxes and [[fraud]] penalties.<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\">{{Bluebook website|first=Emily|last=Cadei|title=California wins last round of $25 million, 26-year tax fight with wealthy inventor|publisher=Sacramento Bee|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article230338079.html|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHyatt filed a protest but after 11 years of administrative proceedings, it was upheld. {{As of|2019|May|13|df=US}}, an appeal is still pending.<ref name=\"2019 SCOTUS\" /> Hyatt also sued the FTB in Nevada, alleging that he was harassed by the FTB and became subject to unconstitutional invasions of [[privacy]]. California's lawyers argued that in accordance with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], Nevada state courts could not hold California tax collectors liable because California law immunizes tax collectors from [[Legal liability|liability]]. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]''; the judgement was affirmed in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2003)|Hyatt I]]''.<ref name=\"2003 SCOTUS\" /><ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nHyatt was then awarded $389 million in damages by a Nevada jury for fraud, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of [[Distress (medicine)|emotional distress]], and in [[punitive damages]]. The Nevada trial court added more than $104.5 million in costs and prejudgement interest, for a total judgement exceeding $490 million,<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"ABAJ\" /><ref name=\"Petition\" /> which was reduced over the course of several appeals. The dispute\u2014''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2016)|Hyatt II]]''\u2014came before the U.S. Supreme Court a second time in 2016. The Court split 4\u20134 on the question of whether ''Nevada v. Hall'' should be overturned, effectively upholding it, but a majority did rule that because Nevada law limits the liability of its state agencies to $50,000 per [[tort]], Nevada state courts could not award Hyatt more than that amount per tort, in keeping with the Full Faith and Credit Clause.<ref name=\"2016 SCOTUS\" /> Consequently, the Nevada Supreme Court deemed a new trial unnecessary, and simply reduced the damages granted to Hyatt to the permitted maximum.

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\n== Legal background ==\nThe doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] is the right of a government not to be sued in its own courts.<ref name=\"Baude p. 4\">{{bluebook journal|last=Baude|first=William|title=Sovereign immunity and the constitutional text|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26400233|year=2017|journal=Va.

More recently, the principle has been defended for a variety of reasons: the idea that the entire community, i.e. the state, cannot commit wrongdoing; that the state's actions are lawful ''per se''; that an agent of the state, when acting unlawfully, necessarily does so outside of their legal authority;{{refn|group=n|Government officers have long been amenable to suit without the government's immunity.{{r|Baude p. 4}}}} opposition to the use of public funds to compensate private injuries; and that being amenable to suits interferes with the state's operation.<ref name=\"Olenick p.1493\">{{bluebook journal|last=Olenick|first=Donald|title=Sovereign immunity in sister-state courts: Full Faith and Credit and federal common law solutions|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122173|year=1980|journal=Colum.

Congress could only appoint courts dealing with [[piracy]], felonies on [[international waters]] and appeals in cases of [[Rule of capture|capture]]. They could also establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals for dealing with disputes between two or more states and disputes with individuals claiming certain land based on different grants of two or more states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 9\">Jacobs, at 9.</ref> However, various states had accumulated large debts with domestic and foreign creditors, largely due to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Confederate government's and some states' failure to pay its creditors was seen as an obstacle to harmony and peace. Some feared that the failure to repay foreign governments and its subjects posed an international threat. In addition, because the domestic creditors were largely concentrated in a few states, people feared that states [[default (finance)|defaulting]] on their debt would cause interstate tension. The legacy of these concerns can be recognized in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], which extended the judicial power of the United States to cases between a state and foreign nationals or citizens of other states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 8-9\">Jacobs, at 8-9.</ref>\n\n''[[Chisholm v.

Hall'' ===\nThe issue of interstate sovereign immunity remained unaddressed by the U.S. Supreme Court until ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]'' (1979). Prior to ''Nevada v. Hall'', courts had generally ruled that the Constitution, at least implicitely, prevented states from being sued in the courts of other states, pursuant to the principle of sovereign immunity.{{refn|group=n|For example, {{cite court|litigants=Paulus v. South Dakota |vol=227|reporter=N.W.|opinion=52|court=[[North Dakota Supreme Court|N.D.]] |date=1929 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3934797/paulus-v-south-dakota/|quote=Therefore, in the absence of allegations as to the law of the sister state showing a consent to be sued, the courts of this state must necessarily regard a sovereign sister state as immune to the same extent that this state would be immune in the absence of a consenting statute.}}}}{{r|Olenick p.1493}} In ''Nevada v. Hall'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a case where two [[California]] residents were severly injured after their car collided with a car that was the property of the [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] on a highway in California. The car was being operated by a [[University of Nevada]] employee on official business. The California residents brought suit against the University, the State of Nevada, and the car's administrator in a [[California Superior Court]]. The Superior Court rejected Nevada's argument that they were immune from suits against them in sister-state courts without their consent and held that it did have [[jurisdiction]] over the case. The Superior Court also rejected Nevada's argument that the Court, in keeping with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], should apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against the state to $25,000 per tort.{{Refn|In 1979, this was raised to $50,000 per tort.{{r|Olenick p. 1495}}|group=n}} Instead, the Superior Court awarded the plaintiffs $1,150,000 in damages. The judgement was affirmed by a [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] and the [[Supreme Court of California]] declined to hear the case.<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495\">Olenick, at 1495.</ref>\n\nNevada petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted ''[[certiorari]]''. The opinion of the Court was authored by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], in which the Court held that the Constitution, specifically Article III and the Eleventh Amendment, did not prevent states from being sued in the courts of sister-states. It also held that California was not required to apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against its state, because California had a substantial interest in allowing persons injured while driving on their highways to receive full compensation when they sued the responsible person(s) in their courts. In addition, Stevens noted that this interest was also furthered by the fact that California had waived its own immunity and allowed for full compensation in cases where the State of California was the defendant. Thus, applying the Nevada tort limit \"would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over nonresident motorists and full recovery.\"<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495-96\">Olenick, at 1495-96.</ref><ref name=\"Decision Nev. v. Hall\">{{ussc|name=Nevada v. Hall|volume=440|page=410|year=1979}}.</ref> In his dissenting opinion, Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] argued that interstate sovereign immunity was found \"not in an express provision of the Constitution but in a guarantee that is implied as an essential component of [[federalism]].\"{{r|Decision Nev. v. Hall}} He also argued that this decision would cause states to refuse to recognize each others' immunity in retaliation, and that states would move assets out of other states, in an attempt to safeguard itself from liability, which would damage the federal system.<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1496-97\">Olenick, at 1496-97.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhen Gilbert P.

The [[California Franchise Tax Board]] completed an audit in 1993 of Hyatt's tax returns, and determined that Hyatt's primary residence was actually California in 1991 and 1992; the FTB assessed Hyatt $13.3 million in back taxes and [[fraud]] penalties.<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\">{{Bluebook website|first=Emily|last=Cadei|title=California wins last round of $25 million, 26-year tax fight with wealthy inventor|publisher=Sacramento Bee|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article230338079.html|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHyatt filed a protest but after 11 years of administrative proceedings, it was upheld. {{As of|2019|May|13|df=US}}, an appeal is still pending.<ref name=\"2019 SCOTUS\" /> Hyatt also sued the FTB in Nevada, alleging that he was harassed by the FTB and became subject to unconstitutional invasions of [[privacy]]. California's lawyers argued that in accordance with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], Nevada state courts could not hold California tax collectors liable because California law immunizes tax collectors from [[Legal liability|liability]]. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]''; the judgement was affirmed in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2003)|Hyatt I]]''.<ref name=\"2003 SCOTUS\" /><ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nHyatt was then awarded $389 million in damages by a Nevada jury for fraud, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of [[Distress (medicine)|emotional distress]], and in [[punitive damages]]. The Nevada trial court added more than $104.5 million in costs and prejudgement interest, for a total judgement exceeding $490 million,<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"ABAJ\" /><ref name=\"Petition\" /> which was reduced over the course of several appeals. The dispute\u2014''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2016)|Hyatt II]]''\u2014came before the U.S. Supreme Court a second time in 2016. The Court split 4\u20134 on the question of whether ''Nevada v. Hall'' should be overturned, effectively upholding it, but a majority did rule that because Nevada law limits the liability of its state agencies to $50,000 per [[tort]], Nevada state courts could not award Hyatt more than that amount per tort, in keeping with the Full Faith and Credit Clause.<ref name=\"2016 SCOTUS\" /> Consequently, the Nevada Supreme Court deemed a new trial unnecessary, and simply reduced the damages granted to Hyatt to the permitted maximum.

The opinion starts with a discussion on the history of state sovereign immunity. The first point made is that the Constitution's use of the word \"State\" reflects certain immunities and that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] supported absolute state immunity. Thomas also stated that, after the Supreme Court restricted state sovereignty in its ''[[Chisholm v.

The operation, codenamed ''King Two'',<ref>Cutler, Thomas J., The Battle of Leyte Gulf: 23\u201326 October 1944, Naval Institute Press, 2001, p.52</ref> launched the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign of 1944\u201345]] for the recapture and liberation of the entire Philippine Archipelago and to end almost three years of [[Second Philippine Republic|Japanese occupation]].\n\n==Background==\nJapan had conquered the Philippines in 1942. Controlling it was vital for Japan's survival in World War II because it commanded sea routes to [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]] by which [[rubber]] and [[petroleum]] were shipped to Japan.<ref name=Prefer>Prefer, Nathan N., 2012, ''Leyte, 1944: The Soldiers' Battle''. Havertown, PA: Casemate Publishers, {{ISBN|9781612001555}}</ref>{{rp|7}}\n\nFor the U.S., capturing the Philippines was a key strategic step in isolating Imperial Japan's military holdings in China and the Pacific theater. It was also a personal matter of pride for MacArthur.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|5}} In 1942, just a month before Japan forced the surrender of all [[USAFFE]] forces in the Philippines, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had ordered MacArthur to leave the Philippines and organize the U.S. forces gathering in Australia,<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|22}} which were meant to relieve the USAFFE. Those relief forces were non-existent;<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|22}} Roosevelt's true intentions in ordering MacArthur to flee the Philippines had been to prevent his capture by the Japanese. Still, MacArthur had vowed that he would return to the Philippines. He repeatedly stated that it was a moral obligation of the U.S. to liberate the Philippines as soon as possible.  In March 1944, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ordered MacArthur to plan an attack on the southern Philippines by the end of the year, and Luzon in early 1945.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|7\u20138}} In July 1944, Roosevelt met with MacArthur and [[Chester Nimitz]] in Hawaii, where the decision was made to invade the Philippines, from which land air bases could be used for the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|8\u20139}}\n\nOver the summer of 1944, planes from the [[aircraft carrier]]s of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. 3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William F. Halsey]] carried out several successful missions over the Philippines and found Japanese resistance lacking.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|9}} Halsey then recommended a direct strike on Leyte, canceling other planned operations, and the Leyte invasion date moved forward to October.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|10}}\n\n[[File:US Armada moving towards Leyte Island.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Amphibious forces approach Leyte, October 1944]]\n\nLeyte, one of the larger islands of the Philippines, has numerous deep-water approaches and sandy beaches which offered opportunities for [[amphibious assault]]s and fast resupply. The roads and lowlands extending inland from Highway&nbsp;1, that ran for {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} along the east coast between Abuyog town to the north and the [[San Juanico Strait]] between Leyte and [[Samar]] Islands, provided avenues for tank-infantry operations, as well as suitable ground for airfield construction. American air forces based on Leyte could strike at enemy bases and airfields anywhere in the [[archipelago]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|10}}\n\nA heavily forested north-south mountain range dominates the interior and separates two sizable valleys, or coastal plains. The larger Leyte Valley extends from the northern coast to the long eastern shore and contains most of the towns and roadways on the island.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|10\u201311}} The other, Ormoc Valley, situated on the west side, was connected to Leyte Valley by a roundabout and winding road, Highway&nbsp;2; it ran from [[Palo, Leyte|Palo]] town on the east coast, then west and northwest through Leyte Valley to the north coast, it then turned south and wound through a mountainous neck to enter the northern Ormoc Valley. This continued south to the port of [[Ormoc City]], then along the western shore to [[Baybay, Leyte|Baybay]] town. The road then turned east to cross the mountainous waist of the island and it connected with Highway&nbsp;1 on the east coast at Abuyog. Below these towns, the mountainous southern third of Leyte was mostly undeveloped.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|10}} High mountain peaks over {{convert|4400|ft|m|abbr=on}}, as well as the jagged outcroppings, ravines, and caves typical of volcanic islands offered formidable defensive opportunities.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|11}} The timing late in the year of the assault would force combat troops and supporting pilots, as well as logistical units, to contend with [[monsoon]] rains.\n\nLeyte's population of over 900,000 people\u2014mostly farmers and fishermen<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|11}}\u2014could be expected to assist an American invasion, since many residents already supported the guerrilla struggle against the Japanese in the face of harsh repression.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|12}} Japanese troop strength on Leyte was estimated by U.S. intelligence at 20,000; mostly of the [[16th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|16th Division]]<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|16\u201317}} under Lieutenant&nbsp;General [[Shiro Makino]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|1}}\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 150\n | header = Theater, naval and air force commanders<br>for the recapture of the Philippines\n | image1 = MacArthur_Manila.jpg\n | caption1 = Gen.

Under cover of incessant artillery and naval gunfire, Bradley's troops made their way through the swamps south and west of the high ground at Labiranan&nbsp;Head. After a three-day fight, the 382nd Infantry Regiment took a key Japanese supply base at [[Tabontabon, Leyte|Tabontabon]], {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and killed some 350&nbsp;Japanese on 28&nbsp;October. Simultaneously two battalions each from the 381st Infantry Regiment and 383rd Infantry Regiments slowly advanced up opposite sides of Catmon Hill and battled the fierce Japanese resistance.

But by 28&nbsp;October, counterattacks by US aircraft on Japanese airfields and shipping on other islands so reduced enemy air strength that conventional air raids ceased to be a major threat. As their air strength diminished, the Japanese resorted to the deadly ''kamikazes'',<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|71}} a corps of suicide pilots who crashed their bomb-laden planes directly into US&nbsp;ships. They chose the large American transport and escort fleet that had gathered in Leyte&nbsp;Gulf on A-day as their first target and sank one escort carrier and badly damaged many other vessels.\n\n[[File:Leyeteislandjapanese.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Four Japanese snipers shot and killed in the muddy water of a bomb crater]]\nA more serious danger to the US forces developed at sea. The Imperial Japanese Navy's high command decided to destroy US Navy forces supporting the Sixth Army by committing its entire remaining surface fleet to a decisive battle with the Americans. The Imperial Navy's plan was to attack in three major task groups. One, which included four [[aircraft carrier]]s with few aircraft aboard, was to act as a decoy, luring the US 3rd&nbsp;Fleet north away from Leyte Gulf. If the decoy was successful, the other two groups, consisting primarily of heavy surface combatants, would enter the gulf from the west and attack the American transports.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:U.S. AA at Tacloban in action.jpg|thumb|left|270px|A US anti-aircraft gun at Tacloban airfield in action]]\n\nOn 23 October, the approach of the enemy surface vessels was detected.

The 21st&nbsp;RCT pulled out from the Panaon area to rejoin the 24th&nbsp;Division and were replaced by a battalion of the 32nd&nbsp;Infantry. On 3&nbsp;November, the 34th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment moved out from west of Carigara to sweep the rest of the northern coast before turning south into the mountains. The 1st&nbsp;Battalion soon came under attack from a ridge along the highway. Supported by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, the unit cleared the ridge, and the 34th&nbsp;Infantry continued unopposed that night through the town of Pinamopoan, recovering numerous heavy weapons abandoned by the enemy, then halted at the point where Highway&nbsp;2 turns south into the mountains.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|111\u2013113}}\n\n===Battle of Breakneck Ridge, Battle of Kilay Ridge===\nOn 7 November 21 Infantry went into its first sustained combat on Leyte when it moved into the mountains along Highway&nbsp;2, near [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]] Bay.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|115}} The fresh regiment, with the 19th&nbsp;Infantry's 3rd&nbsp;Battalion attached, immediately ran into strong defenses of the newly arrived Japanese [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Division]], aligned from east to west across the road and anchored on a network of fighting positions built of heavy logs and interconnecting trench lines and countless spider holes, which became known as \"Breakneck Ridge\" to the Americans, or the \"Yamashita Line\" to the Japanese.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|116}}  General Krueger ordered the 1st Cavalry to join the 24th Infantry Division in the attack south, and the X and XXIV Corps (96th Infantry Division) to block routes through the central mountain range, anticipating General Suzuki's renewed attack with the arrival of his [[26th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|26th Infantry Division]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|120\u2013121}}  Additionally the XXIV Corps had the 7th Infantry Division in Baybay.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|121}}  Plus, Krueger had access to the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd]] and [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Divisions]], and the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]], which MacArthur was staging in Leyte in preparation of the Luzon invasion.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|133}}\n\nA [[typhoon]] began on 8 November, and the heavy rain that followed for several days further impeded American progress.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|116}} Despite the storm and high winds, which added falling trees and mud slides to enemy defenses and delayed supply trains, the 21st&nbsp;Infantry continued its slow and halting attack, with companies often having to withdraw and recapture hills that had been taken earlier. The Americans seized the approaches to Hill&nbsp;1525 {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east, enabling Irving to stretch out the enemy defenses further across a {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} front along Highway&nbsp;2.  After five days of battling against seemingly impregnable hill positions and two nights of repulsing enemy counterattacks proved fruitless, Irving decided on a [[double envelopment]] of the enemy defenders.\n\nOn the east, the 19th&nbsp;Infantry's 2nd&nbsp;Battalion, under Lt. Col. Robert B. Spragins, swung east around Hill&nbsp;1525 behind the enemy right flank, cutting back to Highway&nbsp;2, {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of 'Breakneck Ridge', blocking the Japanese supply line.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|133\u2013140}} On the west, Irving sent the 34th&nbsp;Infantry's 1st&nbsp;Battalion under Lt.&nbsp;Col.

On 2&nbsp;December Clifford's battalion finally cleared the heights overlooking the road, and 32nd&nbsp;Division units quickly took over.

Mountainous terrain and impassable roads forced Sixth Army transportation units to improvise resupply trains of Navy landing craft, tracked landing vehicles, airdrops, artillery tractors, trucks, even carabaos and hundreds of barefoot Filipino bearers. The 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion made daily, often multiple, trips with ammunition and rations between [[Capoocan, Leyte|Capoocan]] and [[Calubian, Leyte|Calubian]]. From Calubian, the 727th tractors would navigate the Naga River to Consuegra and then traverse overland to Agahang. On their return trip, they would evacuate the casualties. Not surprisingly, the complex scheduling slowed resupply as well as the pace of assaults, particularly in the mountains north and east of Ormoc Valley and subsequently in the ridgelines along Ormoc&nbsp;Bay.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Battle of Shoestring Ridge===\n{{for|the naval battle| Battle of Ormoc Bay}}\nIn mid-November XXIV&nbsp;Corps had the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32nd Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Lt.

But Japanese defenders continued to fight as units until 31&nbsp;December, and the ensuing mop-up of stragglers continued until 8&nbsp;May 1945.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe campaign for Leyte proved the first and most decisive operation in the American reconquest of the Philippines. Japanese losses in the campaign were heavy, with the army losing four divisions and several separate combat units, while the navy lost 26 major warships and 46 large transports and hundreds of merchant ships. The struggle also reduced Japanese land-based air capability in the Philippines by more than 50%. Some 250,000 troops still remained on [[Luzon]], but the loss of air and naval support at Leyte so narrowed Gen.&nbsp;Yamashita's options that he now had to fight a passive defensive of Luzon,<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|325}} the largest and most important island in the Philippines. In effect, once the decisive battle of Leyte was lost, the Japanese gave up hope of retaining the Philippines, conceding to the Allies a critical bastion from which Japan could be easily cut off from outside resources, and from which the final assaults on the Japanese home islands could be launched.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \n\n==1998 claims re Japanese intelligence== \nIn 1998 it was claimed in Australia (see [[Royal Commission on Espionage]]) that Allied estimates of Japanese troop strengths including those on Leyte were given to Tokyo via the Soviet consulate in [[Harbin]], Manchuria as Stalin wanted to delay an American victory over Japan until the Soviet Union could participate. MacArthur\u2019s G-2 [[Charles A. Willoughby|Willoughhby]] had underestimated the numbers, and the troops were reinforced.

Those relief forces were non-existent;<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|22}} Roosevelt's true intentions in ordering MacArthur to flee the Philippines had been to prevent his capture by the Japanese. Still, MacArthur had vowed that he would return to the Philippines. He repeatedly stated that it was a moral obligation of the U.S. to liberate the Philippines as soon as possible.  In March 1944, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ordered MacArthur to plan an attack on the southern Philippines by the end of the year, and Luzon in early 1945.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|7\u20138}} In July 1944, Roosevelt met with MacArthur and [[Chester Nimitz]] in Hawaii, where the decision was made to invade the Philippines, from which land air bases could be used for the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|8\u20139}}\n\nOver the summer of 1944, planes from the [[aircraft carrier]]s of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. 3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William F.

This continued south to the port of [[Ormoc City]], then along the western shore to [[Baybay, Leyte|Baybay]] town.

Under cover of incessant artillery and naval gunfire, Bradley's troops made their way through the swamps south and west of the high ground at Labiranan&nbsp;Head. After a three-day fight, the 382nd Infantry Regiment took a key Japanese supply base at [[Tabontabon, Leyte|Tabontabon]], {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and killed some 350&nbsp;Japanese on 28&nbsp;October. Simultaneously two battalions each from the 381st Infantry Regiment and 383rd Infantry Regiments slowly advanced up opposite sides of Catmon Hill and battled the fierce Japanese resistance. When the mop-up of Catmon Hill was completed on 31&nbsp;October, the Americans had cleared 53 [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], 17 caves, and several heavy artillery positions.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|65\u201369}}\n[[File:U.S. APC at Libaran Head.jpg|thumb|left|270px|US armored car at Labiranan Head]]\n\nOn the left of XXIV Corps, the 7th Infantry Division under Maj.

But by 28&nbsp;October, counterattacks by US aircraft on Japanese airfields and shipping on other islands so reduced enemy air strength that conventional air raids ceased to be a major threat. As their air strength diminished, the Japanese resorted to the deadly ''kamikazes'',<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|71}} a corps of suicide pilots who crashed their bomb-laden planes directly into US&nbsp;ships. They chose the large American transport and escort fleet that had gathered in Leyte&nbsp;Gulf on A-day as their first target and sank one escort carrier and badly damaged many other vessels.\n\n[[File:Leyeteislandjapanese.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Four Japanese snipers shot and killed in the muddy water of a bomb crater]]\nA more serious danger to the US forces developed at sea. The Imperial Japanese Navy's high command decided to destroy US Navy forces supporting the Sixth Army by committing its entire remaining surface fleet to a decisive battle with the Americans. The Imperial Navy's plan was to attack in three major task groups. One, which included four [[aircraft carrier]]s with few aircraft aboard, was to act as a decoy, luring the US 3rd&nbsp;Fleet north away from Leyte Gulf. If the decoy was successful, the other two groups, consisting primarily of heavy surface combatants, would enter the gulf from the west and attack the American transports.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:U.S. AA at Tacloban in action.jpg|thumb|left|270px|A US anti-aircraft gun at Tacloban airfield in action]]\n\nOn 23 October, the approach of the enemy surface vessels was detected.

Krueger planned a giant [[pincer movement|pincer operation]] to clear Ormoc Valley, with X&nbsp;Corps forces moving south, and XXIV&nbsp;Corps units pushing north from Baybay.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|111}} To overcome the expected increased resistance, especially in the mountain barrier to the north, Krueger mobilized his reserve forces, the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd]] and [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]] Infantry Divisions, while MacArthur activated the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]]. The 21st&nbsp;RCT pulled out from the Panaon area to rejoin the 24th&nbsp;Division and were replaced by a battalion of the 32nd&nbsp;Infantry. On 3&nbsp;November, the 34th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment moved out from west of Carigara to sweep the rest of the northern coast before turning south into the mountains. The 1st&nbsp;Battalion soon came under attack from a ridge along the highway. Supported by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, the unit cleared the ridge, and the 34th&nbsp;Infantry continued unopposed that night through the town of Pinamopoan, recovering numerous heavy weapons abandoned by the enemy, then halted at the point where Highway&nbsp;2 turns south into the mountains.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|111\u2013113}}\n\n===Battle of Breakneck Ridge, Battle of Kilay Ridge===\nOn 7 November 21 Infantry went into its first sustained combat on Leyte when it moved into the mountains along Highway&nbsp;2, near [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]] Bay.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|115}} The fresh regiment, with the 19th&nbsp;Infantry's 3rd&nbsp;Battalion attached, immediately ran into strong defenses of the newly arrived Japanese [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Division]], aligned from east to west across the road and anchored on a network of fighting positions built of heavy logs and interconnecting trench lines and countless spider holes, which became known as \"Breakneck Ridge\" to the Americans, or the \"Yamashita Line\" to the Japanese.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|116}}  General Krueger ordered the 1st Cavalry to join the 24th Infantry Division in the attack south, and the X and XXIV Corps (96th Infantry Division) to block routes through the central mountain range, anticipating General Suzuki's renewed attack with the arrival of his [[26th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|26th Infantry Division]].<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|120\u2013121}}  Additionally the XXIV Corps had the 7th Infantry Division in Baybay.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|121}}  Plus, Krueger had access to the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd]] and [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Divisions]], and the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]], which MacArthur was staging in Leyte in preparation of the Luzon invasion.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|133}}\n\nA [[typhoon]] began on 8 November, and the heavy rain that followed for several days further impeded American progress.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|116}} Despite the storm and high winds, which added falling trees and mud slides to enemy defenses and delayed supply trains, the 21st&nbsp;Infantry continued its slow and halting attack, with companies often having to withdraw and recapture hills that had been taken earlier. The Americans seized the approaches to Hill&nbsp;1525 {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east, enabling Irving to stretch out the enemy defenses further across a {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} front along Highway&nbsp;2.  After five days of battling against seemingly impregnable hill positions and two nights of repulsing enemy counterattacks proved fruitless, Irving decided on a [[double envelopment]] of the enemy defenders.\n\nOn the east, the 19th&nbsp;Infantry's 2nd&nbsp;Battalion, under Lt. Col. Robert B. Spragins, swung east around Hill&nbsp;1525 behind the enemy right flank, cutting back to Highway&nbsp;2, {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of 'Breakneck Ridge', blocking the Japanese supply line.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|133\u2013140}} On the west, Irving sent the 34th&nbsp;Infantry's 1st&nbsp;Battalion under Lt.&nbsp;Col. Thomas E. Clifford, over water from the Carigara area to a point {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the southward turn of Highway&nbsp;2, and moved it inland. This amphibious maneuver was made in eighteen [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]] of the 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion.<ref>Journal, 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 6 Nov 1944 to 10 Nov 1944</ref>  After crossing a ridge line and the Leyte River, they approached the enemy left flank at {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} on Kilay Ridge, the highest terrain behind the main battle area.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|147}} Both battalions reached positions only about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart on opposite sides of the highway by 13&nbsp;November despite strong opposition and heavy rains.

On 2&nbsp;December Clifford's battalion finally cleared the heights overlooking the road, and 32nd&nbsp;Division units quickly took over. Clifford's outfit suffered 26&nbsp;killed, 101&nbsp;wounded and two missing, in contrast to 900&nbsp;Japanese dead.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|162}} For their arduous efforts against Kilay Ridge and adjacent areas, both flanking battalions received [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]s.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|147,162}} Clifford and Spragins both received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for their actions.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|142,152}} It was not until 14&nbsp;December that the 32nd&nbsp;Division finally cleared the Breakneck\u2013Kilay Ridge area, and linked up with the 1st&nbsp;Cavalry Division on 19 Dec., placing the most heavily defended portions of Highway&nbsp;2 between Carigara&nbsp;Bay and the Ormoc Valley under X&nbsp;Corps control.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|266,269}}\n\nThroughout this phase, American efforts had become increasingly hampered by logistical problems. Mountainous terrain and impassable roads forced Sixth Army transportation units to improvise resupply trains of Navy landing craft, tracked landing vehicles, airdrops, artillery tractors, trucks, even carabaos and hundreds of barefoot Filipino bearers. The 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion made daily, often multiple, trips with ammunition and rations between [[Capoocan, Leyte|Capoocan]] and [[Calubian, Leyte|Calubian]]. From Calubian, the 727th tractors would navigate the Naga River to Consuegra and then traverse overland to Agahang. On their return trip, they would evacuate the casualties. Not surprisingly, the complex scheduling slowed resupply as well as the pace of assaults, particularly in the mountains north and east of Ormoc Valley and subsequently in the ridgelines along Ormoc&nbsp;Bay.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Battle of Shoestring Ridge===\n{{for|the naval battle| Battle of Ormoc Bay}}\nIn mid-November XXIV&nbsp;Corps had the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32nd Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Lt.

On 16&nbsp;December, the 2nd&nbsp;Battalion, 32nd&nbsp;Infantry, made slow but steady progress into the mountains from the Ormoc&nbsp;Bay area to meet the airborne regiment and assist its passage westward. On 23&nbsp;December, after battling scattered Japanese defenders on ridges and in caves, the 7th&nbsp;Division infantrymen met troops from the 2nd&nbsp;Battalion, [[187th Glider Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Glider Infantry Regiment]], which had passed through the 511th, to complete the cross-island move, and basically destroying the Japanese [[26th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|26th Infantry Division]] in the process.<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|258\u2013264}}\n\nGen.

Farther north, other US forces made faster progress against more disorganized and dispirited enemy troops. 1st&nbsp;Cavalry Division troops reached the coast on 28&nbsp;December<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|295}} as 24th&nbsp;Division units cleared the last enemy positions from the northwest corner of Leyte on the same day and two days later met patrols of the 32nd&nbsp;Division. But Japanese defenders continued to fight as units until 31&nbsp;December, and the ensuing mop-up of stragglers continued until 8&nbsp;May 1945.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe campaign for Leyte proved the first and most decisive operation in the American reconquest of the Philippines. Japanese losses in the campaign were heavy, with the army losing four divisions and several separate combat units, while the navy lost 26 major warships and 46 large transports and hundreds of merchant ships. The struggle also reduced Japanese land-based air capability in the Philippines by more than 50%. Some 250,000 troops still remained on [[Luzon]], but the loss of air and naval support at Leyte so narrowed Gen.&nbsp;Yamashita's options that he now had to fight a passive defensive of Luzon,<ref name=Prefer/>{{rp|325}} the largest and most important island in the Philippines. In effect, once the decisive battle of Leyte was lost, the Japanese gave up hope of retaining the Philippines, conceding to the Allies a critical bastion from which Japan could be easily cut off from outside resources, and from which the final assaults on the Japanese home islands could be launched.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \n\n==1998 claims re Japanese intelligence== \nIn 1998 it was claimed in Australia (see [[Royal Commission on Espionage]]) that Allied estimates of Japanese troop strengths including those on Leyte were given to Tokyo via the Soviet consulate in [[Harbin]], Manchuria as Stalin wanted to delay an American victory over Japan until the Soviet Union could participate. MacArthur\u2019s G-2 [[Charles A. Willoughby|Willoughhby]] had underestimated the numbers, and the troops were reinforced.

Paulissen also represented his nation [[Belgium]] in four editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008), where he competed in men's mountain biking since it officially became an Olympic sport in 1996.

With only 70 meters left to go, Paulissen held off a sprint duel match against Switzerland's [[Christoph Sauser]] for a spectacular finish, until they suddenly made contact with their handlebars and arms near the barrier and then both crashed. Being the first man up after hitting the tarmac hard, Paulissen reluctantly carried his broken bike towards the finish, while his rival Sauser remounted his lead to cross the line first, but ended his campaign with a protest. After the race, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] officials decided that Sauser was relegated to second place for riding \"dangerously\" in the sprint and instead Paulissen was declared the World champion with a time of 4:46:56.

Being the first man up after hitting the tarmac hard, Paulissen reluctantly carried his broken bike towards the finish, while his rival Sauser remounted his lead to cross the line first, but ended his campaign with a protest. After the race, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] officials decided that Sauser was relegated to second place for riding \"dangerously\" in the sprint and instead Paulissen was declared the World champion with a time of 4:46:56. Following his controversial triumph, Paulissen admitted, \"I am very happy with this success.

More restrictively, literature refers to [[writing]] considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, and sometimes deploys language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.\n\nIts Latin root ''literatura''/''litteratura'' (derived itself from ''littera'': ''letter'' or ''handwriting'') was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung ([[oral literature]]), and non-written verbal art forms. [[History of printing|Developments in print technology]] have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in [[electronic literature]].\n\nLiterature is classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]. Fiction can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]], or [[drama]]; and such works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or [[genre]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nDefinitions of literature have varied over time: it is a \"culturally relative definition\".<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28\">Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28</ref> In [[Western Europe]] prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing.<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28\" /> A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], in which it began to demarcate \"imaginative\" writing.<ref name=\"Ross, The Emergence of Literature: Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century, 406\">Ross, \"The Emergence of \"Literature\": Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century\", 406</ref>{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=16}} Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; [[cultural studies]], for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to [[Western canon|canonical works]].\n\nThe [[value judgment]] definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called ''[[belles-lettres]]'' ('fine writing') tradition.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}} This sort of definition is that used in the [[Encyclopedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] (1910\u201311) when it classifies literature as \"the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing.\"<ref name=\"Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538\">Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538</ref> Problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes \"literature\": anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}}\n\nThe [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] definition is that \"literature\" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the \"literariness\" or \"poetic\" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., [[journalism]]).<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4\">Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4</ref>{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=2-6}} Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., \"[[scientific literature]]\"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Jim|year=1997|title=What is Literature?

When defined exclusively as written work, [[Ancient Egyptian literature]],{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=19}} along with [[Sumerian literature]], are considered the world's [[Ancient literature |oldest literatures]].<ref name=\"Black et al.

National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. The epics of [[Homer]], dating from the early to middle [[Iron Age]], and the great [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.\n\nLiterature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters' actions and words or the authors' style of writing and the intent behind the words. The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about human history. Literature provides insights about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. For instance, [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] authors argue that history and fiction both constitute systems of signification by which we make sense of the past.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Timothy Findley's Novels Between Ethics and Postmodernism|last=Krause|first=Dagmar|publisher=K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann|year=2005|isbn=3826030052|location=Wurzburg|pages=21}}</ref> It is asserted that both of these are \"discourses, [[Social constructionism|human constructs]], signifying systems, and both derive their major claim to truth from that identity.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Literature provides views of life, which is crucial in obtaining truth and in understanding human life throughout history and its periods.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Philosophy, Literature and the Human Good|last=Weston|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415243378|location=London|pages=xix, 133}}</ref> Specifically, it explores the possibilities of living in terms of certain values under given social and historical circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLiterature helps us understand references made in more modern literature because authors often reference mythology and other old religious texts to describe ancient civilizations such as the Hellenes and the Egyptians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical-critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology|last=Schelling|first=F.W.J.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2007|isbn=9780791471319|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I\"<ref>Lord Byron, (2008) Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage: Canto I.  Lord Byron: The Major Works. ed. McGann, J.J. New York: Oxford University Press</ref> and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature.<ref name=\"go.galegroup.com\">English: a degree for the curious. (2013, September 16). UWIRE Text, p. 1.

Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we{{Who|date=April 2017}} continue to evolve and learn more and more.\n\nAs a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], [[Ancient India]], [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Classical antiquity|Ancient Greece and Rome]]. Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit ''[[Panchatantra]]'' or the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of Ovid. [[Drama]] and [[satire]] also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. [[Lyric poetry]] (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the ''Shijing'' or ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]]''. Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.\n\nIn ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, [[historiography]], [[military science]], agriculture, and [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. China, the origin of modern [[paper making]] and [[woodblock printing]], produced the world's first [[print culture]]s.<ref>A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1\u20134. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}</ref> Much of Chinese literature originates with the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] period that occurred during the [[Zhou Dynasty|Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (769\u2012269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of [[Confucianism]], of [[Taoism|Daoism]], of [[Mohism]], of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as well as works of military science (e.g. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'') and [[History of China|Chinese history]] (e.g. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. An exemplary piece of [[narrative history]] of ancient China was the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', which was compiled no later than 389 BCE, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BCE historian [[Zuo Qiuming]].\n\nIn ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included [[Sanskrit drama|drama]], [[Panchatantra|fables]], [[S\u016btra|sutras]] and [[Indian epic poetry|epic poetry]]. [[Sanskrit literature]] begins with the [[Vedas]], dating back to 1500\u20131000 BCE, and continues with the [[Sanskrit Epics]] of [[Iron Age India]]. The Vedas are among the [[Ancient literature|oldest sacred texts]]. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500\u20131000 BCE, and the \"circum-Vedic\" texts, as well as the [[shakha|redaction]] of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000\u2012500 BCE, resulting in a [[Vedic period]], spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Flood\">[[Gavin Flood]] sums up mainstream estimates, according to which the Rigveda was compiled from as early as 1500 BCE over a period of several centuries. {{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=37}}</ref> The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BCE saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD. Other major literary works are [[Ramcharitmanas]] & Krishnacharitmanas.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the epics of [[Homer]], who wrote the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Hesiod]], who wrote ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]'', are some of the earliest, and most influential, of Ancient Greek literature. Classical Greek genres included philosophy, [[poetry]], historiography, [[comedies]] and [[drama]]s. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of [[Western philosophy]], [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]] were influential [[lyric poetry|lyric poets]], and [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of [[tragedy|tragedies]] written and performed during the [[classical age]], only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The plays of [[Aristophanes]] provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as [[Ancient Greek comedy|Old Comedy]], the earliest form of Greek Comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre.<ref>''Aristophanes: Butts'' K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. p. x.</ref>\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], one of the most prolific [[Germany|German]] writers]]\n\nRoman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the [[Middle Ages]] was the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the [[novel]], of which early and important examples are the Chinese [[Journey to the West|Monkey]] and the German [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]] books.\n\nIn the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of [[Romanticism]] in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th century went on, European fiction evolved towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[T.S.Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]] exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.\n\n[[Genre fiction]] also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical [[Detective fiction|detective]] and the alternative realities of [[science fiction]]. The separation of \"mainstream\" and \"genre\" forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. [[William Burroughs]], in his early works, and [[Hunter S. Thompson]] expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the [[World War II|second World War]], and [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.\n\n==Psychology and literature==\nTheorists suggest that literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise.{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=1}} That literature aids the psychological development and understanding of the reader, allowing someone to access emotional states from which they had distanced themselves. D. Mitchell, for example, explains how one author used young-adult literature to describe a state of \"wonder\" she had experienced as a child.<ref>{{Cite journal | jstor = 821301 |title = From the Secondary Section: Young Adult Literature and the English Teacher |journal = The English Journal |volume = 90 |issue = 3| pages = 23\u201325 |last1 = Mitchell |first1 = Diana |year = 2001}}</ref> Some researchers focus on the significance of literature in an individual's psychological development.

Now, science appears mostly in [[scientific journal|journals]]. Scientific works of [[Aristotle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. Yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study.

However, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. As a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often (and in its better moments) has that quality. Major \"literary\" historians include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Procopius]], all of whom count as canonical literary figures.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Law ===\n[[Law]] offers more ambiguity.

Tragedies generally presented very serious [[Theme (literature)|themes]]. With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. [[War of the Worlds (radio)]] in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.\n\n== Other narrative forms ==\n* [[Electronic literature]] is a literary genre consisting of works that originate in digital environments.\n* [[Film]]s, videos and broadcast [[soap opera]]s have carved out a niche which often parallels the functionality of prose fiction.\n* [[Graphic novel]]s and [[comic book]]s present stories told in a combination of sequential artwork, dialogue and text.\n\n== Literary techniques ==\n{{Main article|List of narrative techniques}}\nLiterary technique and literary device are used by authors to produce specific effects.\n\nLiterary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches: examples for fiction are, whether a work is narrated in [[Grammatical person|first-person]], or from another perspective; whether a traditional linear narrative or a [[nonlinear narrative]] is used; the [[literary genre]] that is chosen.\n\nLiterary devices involves specific elements within the work that make it effective. Examples include [[metaphor]], [[simile]], [[ellipsis]], narrative [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and [[allegory]]. Even simple [[word play]] functions as a literary device.

More restrictively, literature refers to [[writing]] considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, and sometimes deploys language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.\n\nIts Latin root ''literatura''/''litteratura'' (derived itself from ''littera'': ''letter'' or ''handwriting'') was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung ([[oral literature]]), and non-written verbal art forms. [[History of printing|Developments in print technology]] have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in [[electronic literature]].\n\nLiterature is classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]. Fiction can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]], or [[drama]]; and such works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or [[genre]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nDefinitions of literature have varied over time: it is a \"culturally relative definition\".<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28\">Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28</ref> In [[Western Europe]] prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing.<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28\" /> A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], in which it began to demarcate \"imaginative\" writing.<ref name=\"Ross, The Emergence of Literature: Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century, 406\">Ross, \"The Emergence of \"Literature\": Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century\", 406</ref>{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=16}} Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; [[cultural studies]], for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to [[Western canon|canonical works]].\n\nThe [[value judgment]] definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called ''[[belles-lettres]]'' ('fine writing') tradition.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}} This sort of definition is that used in the [[Encyclopedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] (1910\u201311) when it classifies literature as \"the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing.\"<ref name=\"Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538\">Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538</ref> Problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes \"literature\": anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}}\n\nThe [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] definition is that \"literature\" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the \"literariness\" or \"poetic\" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., [[journalism]]).<ref name=\"Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4\">Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4</ref>{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=2-6}} Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., \"[[scientific literature]]\"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Jim|year=1997|title=What is Literature?

When defined exclusively as written work, [[Ancient Egyptian literature]],{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=19}} along with [[Sumerian literature]], are considered the world's [[Ancient literature |oldest literatures]].<ref name=\"Black et al.

National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. The epics of [[Homer]], dating from the early to middle [[Iron Age]], and the great [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.\n\nLiterature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters' actions and words or the authors' style of writing and the intent behind the words. The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about human history. Literature provides insights about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. For instance, [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] authors argue that history and fiction both constitute systems of signification by which we make sense of the past.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Timothy Findley's Novels Between Ethics and Postmodernism|last=Krause|first=Dagmar|publisher=K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann|year=2005|isbn=3826030052|location=Wurzburg|pages=21}}</ref> It is asserted that both of these are \"discourses, [[Social constructionism|human constructs]], signifying systems, and both derive their major claim to truth from that identity.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Literature provides views of life, which is crucial in obtaining truth and in understanding human life throughout history and its periods.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Philosophy, Literature and the Human Good|last=Weston|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415243378|location=London|pages=xix, 133}}</ref> Specifically, it explores the possibilities of living in terms of certain values under given social and historical circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLiterature helps us understand references made in more modern literature because authors often reference mythology and other old religious texts to describe ancient civilizations such as the Hellenes and the Egyptians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical-critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology|last=Schelling|first=F.W.J.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2007|isbn=9780791471319|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I\"<ref>Lord Byron, (2008) Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage: Canto I.  Lord Byron: The Major Works. ed. McGann, J.J. New York: Oxford University Press</ref> and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature.<ref name=\"go.galegroup.com\">English: a degree for the curious. (2013, September 16). UWIRE Text, p. 1.

Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we{{Who|date=April 2017}} continue to evolve and learn more and more.\n\nAs a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], [[Ancient India]], [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Classical antiquity|Ancient Greece and Rome]]. Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit ''[[Panchatantra]]'' or the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of Ovid. [[Drama]] and [[satire]] also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. [[Lyric poetry]] (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the ''Shijing'' or ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]]''. Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.\n\nIn ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, [[historiography]], [[military science]], agriculture, and [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. China, the origin of modern [[paper making]] and [[woodblock printing]], produced the world's first [[print culture]]s.<ref>A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1\u20134. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}</ref> Much of Chinese literature originates with the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] period that occurred during the [[Zhou Dynasty|Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (769\u2012269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of [[Confucianism]], of [[Taoism|Daoism]], of [[Mohism]], of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as well as works of military science (e.g. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'') and [[History of China|Chinese history]] (e.g. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. An exemplary piece of [[narrative history]] of ancient China was the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', which was compiled no later than 389 BCE, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BCE historian [[Zuo Qiuming]].\n\nIn ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included [[Sanskrit drama|drama]], [[Panchatantra|fables]], [[S\u016btra|sutras]] and [[Indian epic poetry|epic poetry]]. [[Sanskrit literature]] begins with the [[Vedas]], dating back to 1500\u20131000 BCE, and continues with the [[Sanskrit Epics]] of [[Iron Age India]]. The Vedas are among the [[Ancient literature|oldest sacred texts]]. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500\u20131000 BCE, and the \"circum-Vedic\" texts, as well as the [[shakha|redaction]] of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000\u2012500 BCE, resulting in a [[Vedic period]], spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Flood\">[[Gavin Flood]] sums up mainstream estimates, according to which the Rigveda was compiled from as early as 1500 BCE over a period of several centuries. {{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=37}}</ref> The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BCE saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD. Other major literary works are [[Ramcharitmanas]] & Krishnacharitmanas.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the epics of [[Homer]], who wrote the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Hesiod]], who wrote ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]'', are some of the earliest, and most influential, of Ancient Greek literature. Classical Greek genres included philosophy, [[poetry]], historiography, [[comedies]] and [[drama]]s. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of [[Western philosophy]], [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]] were influential [[lyric poetry|lyric poets]], and [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of [[tragedy|tragedies]] written and performed during the [[classical age]], only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The plays of [[Aristophanes]] provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as [[Ancient Greek comedy|Old Comedy]], the earliest form of Greek Comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre.<ref>''Aristophanes: Butts'' K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. p. x.</ref>\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], one of the most prolific [[Germany|German]] writers]]\n\nRoman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the [[Middle Ages]] was the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the [[novel]], of which early and important examples are the Chinese [[Journey to the West|Monkey]] and the German [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]] books.\n\nIn the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of [[Romanticism]] in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th century went on, European fiction evolved towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[T.S.Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]] exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.\n\n[[Genre fiction]] also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical [[Detective fiction|detective]] and the alternative realities of [[science fiction]]. The separation of \"mainstream\" and \"genre\" forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. [[William Burroughs]], in his early works, and [[Hunter S. Thompson]] expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the [[World War II|second World War]], and [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.\n\n==Psychology and literature==\nTheorists suggest that literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise.{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=1}} That literature aids the psychological development and understanding of the reader, allowing someone to access emotional states from which they had distanced themselves.

Now, science appears mostly in [[scientific journal|journals]]. Scientific works of [[Aristotle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. Yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study. Outside of \"[[history of science]]\" programs, students rarely read such works.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nPhilosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. More of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in [[Academic publishing|academic journals]]. Major philosophers through history\u2014[[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]], [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]\u2014have become as canonical as any writers.  Philosophical writing spans from humanistic prose to formal [[logic]], the latter having become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of [[mathematics]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== History ===\nA significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature, particularly the genre known as [[creative nonfiction]], as can a great deal of journalism, such as [[literary journalism]]. However, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. As a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often (and in its better moments) has that quality. Major \"literary\" historians include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Procopius]], all of whom count as canonical literary figures.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Law ===\n[[Law]] offers more ambiguity. Some writings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], the law tables of [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], or even the early parts of the [[Bible]] could be seen as legal literature. [[Roman law|Roman civil law]] as codified in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' during the reign of [[Justinian I]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] has a reputation as significant literature. The founding documents of many countries, including [[Constitution]]s and [[Law Code]]s, can count as literature.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\n== Drama ==\n{{Main article|Drama}}\n\nDrama is literature intended for [[performance]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elam|first1=Kier|title=The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama|url=https://archive.org/details/semioticsoftheat0000elam|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Methuen|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-416-72060-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/semioticsoftheat0000elam/page/98 98]}}</ref> The form is often combined with music and dance, as in [[opera]] and [[musical theatre]]. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a [[playwright]] that is intended for performance in a theater; it comprises chiefly [[dialogue]] between [[Fictional character|characters]], and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A [[closet drama]], by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cody|first1=Gabrielle H.|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City|page=271|edition=Volume 1}}</ref> Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.\n\n[[Greek theatre|Greek drama]] exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. [[Tragedy]], as a dramatic [[genre]], developed as a performance associated with [[religion|religious]] and civic [[festival]]s, typically enacting or developing upon well-known [[history|historical]] or [[mythology|mythological]] themes. Tragedies generally presented very serious [[Theme (literature)|themes]]. With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. [[War of the Worlds (radio)]] in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.\n\n== Other narrative forms ==\n* [[Electronic literature]] is a literary genre consisting of works that originate in digital environments.\n* [[Film]]s, videos and broadcast [[soap opera]]s have carved out a niche which often parallels the functionality of prose fiction.\n* [[Graphic novel]]s and [[comic book]]s present stories told in a combination of sequential artwork, dialogue and text.\n\n== Literary techniques ==\n{{Main article|List of narrative techniques}}\nLiterary technique and literary device are used by authors to produce specific effects.\n\nLiterary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches: examples for fiction are, whether a work is narrated in [[Grammatical person|first-person]], or from another perspective; whether a traditional linear narrative or a [[nonlinear narrative]] is used; the [[literary genre]] that is chosen.\n\nLiterary devices involves specific elements within the work that make it effective. Examples include [[metaphor]], [[simile]], [[ellipsis]], narrative [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and [[allegory]]. Even simple [[word play]] functions as a literary device. In fiction [[stream-of-consciousness narrative]] is a literary device.\n\n== Legal status ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nLiterary works have been protected by copyright law from unauthorized reproduction since at least 1710.<ref>The Statute of Anne 1710 and the Literary Copyright Act 1842 used the term \"book\".
