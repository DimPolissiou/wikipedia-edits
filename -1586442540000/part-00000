Kassel's home barn is the [[Eissporthalle Kassel]], which has a capacity of 6,100. The club's nickname is the Sled Dogs. Kassel has won two second level championships in 2008 and 2016 and have won one top level junior championship in 2004. The Huskies have finished runner-up in Germany's top league, [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]], in [[1996\u201397 DEL season|1997]] and have been beaten finalists in the [[German Cup (ice hockey)|Deutscher Eishockey-Pokal]] in 2004.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ice Hockey in Kassel before and founding of the club===\n[[File:Schlossteich-1901.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skating on the castle pond, winter 1900\u20131901]]\nIn the 19th century, the [[Karlsaue|Karlsaue park]] was already a popular place for [[ice skating]] during the winter months on the frozen [[Fulda (river)|Fulda river]].<ref>Abhandlungen u. Report of the Association for Natural History to Kassel, 1900, p. 2.</ref> Skating in Kassel at the time was called \u2018foot skating\u2019.<ref>Journal of the Association for Hessian History, J.J. Bohn\u00e9, 1911, p. 302.</ref> The earliest example of [[ice hockey]] being played in Kassel came from a 1926 photo from the court photographer Carl Eberth, depicting young people playing ice hockey on the frozen Fulda.\n\nIn 1966, Helmut Spohr, a former [[association football|football]] player for [[KSV Hessen Kassel]], introduced the idea of establishing an ice hockey club. Spohr teamed up with Viktor Klement to form what was the first ice hockey team in Kassel, ESV Jahn Kassel. They managed to source some disused firefighting water hoses and in winter they built an outdoors ice rink with the hoses on top of a tennis court in the park as there were no ice machines. Players started to join in the games and eventually they had enough for a team to play other regional social community groups in [[Hannover]] and [[Bad Nauheim]].<ref name=\"establishment\">{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie.cfm | title=Seit mehr als 40 Jahren Eishockey in Kassel | publisher=Kassel Huskies | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025816/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie.cfm | archive-date=24 January 2009 | language=German}}</ref>\n\n<div style=\"clear:right;float: right; text-align: right; padding-left: 15px; font-size: 95%; \">\n{| class=\"wikitable zebra\" style=\"width: 230px; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| League\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Finish\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Finals\n|-\n| 1977/78 || [[Regionalliga (ice hockey)|RL]] || 5th || {{tooltip|''DNQ''|Did not qualify}}\n|-\n| 1978/79 || RL || 5th || ''DNQ''\n|-\n| 1979/80 || RL || 1st || 2nd\n|}\n</div>\n\nKassel Huskies was established 19 February 1977 as ''ESG Kassel Ice Sports Community''.<ref name=\"establishment\"/> The club was established the same year as the first indoor ice rink was built in Kassel, the [[Eissporthalle Kassel]], by Edith and Simon Kimm.<ref name=\"earlyyears\">{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_I.cfm | title=Wissen sie noch, wann die Kassel Huskies Vizemeister waren? | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025837/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_I.cfm | archive-date=24 January 2009 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nESG Kassel began life playing in the [[Regionalliga (ice hockey)|Regionalliga]], the fourth division of German ice hockey, in the 1977/78 Regionalliga West season. Their first official match was played on 30 October 1977 against SV Brackwede. 900 spectators turned out for the opening match. Kassel, led by Canadian head coach Danny Coutu, lost their opening match 2-5. Interest in the team and the sport grew in northern Hessen and soon the team was achieving public attendance at matches of up to 3,000 people in their opening season. Kassel went on to finish midtable in 5th place.<ref name=\"establishment\"/>\n\nESG Kassel repeated their form in 1978/79 by finishing fifth in the league table and missing out on finals.

Led by players who would go on to become legends of the club, Herbert Heinrich and Shane Tarves, Kassel challenged for promotion to the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2.Bundesliga]].<ref name=\"earlyyears\"/> In 1981/82 the team finished second in the league and runner-up in the finals to qualify for promotion to 2.Bundesliga. However, due to financial limitations the club was unable to accept the promotion and remained in Oberliga. The following season the City of Kassel stepped in to shore up financial support of the team and under the guidance of Finnish coach Jorma Siitarinen, Kassel finished top of the table and were promoted to 2.Bundesliga.\n\nKassel staved off relegation back to the Oberliga in their first two seasons in the 2.Bundesliga by winning their relegation play-offs. The club reinvested in the playing roster and brought in a number of high-profile expensive players to the club including Dave O'Brien and Miroslav Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to start to challenge for promotion to the [[Eishockey-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]]. The club was again in a risky financial position after the investments in the roster and needed promotion to the top division to help pay off the debts.<ref name=\"earlyyears\"/>\n\nESG finished the 1985\u201386 season in third spot, missing promotion by two points. A decisive local Hessen derby against rivals Eintracht Frankfurt (today [[L\u00f6wen Frankfurt]]) is regarded as the match promotion was lost. Kassel led 3-0 in the match but Frankfurt came from behind to defeat them 4-3. The following season, Kassel again challenged for the league title and promotion but finished second behind [[BSC Preussen]].

The club remained in the 2.Bundesliga for season 87/88, however due to the high operating costs of competing in the level two league it was decided to voluntarily be relegated back to Oberliga at the conclusion of the season. The roster was dismantled by new coach Richard Piechutta. Shane Tarves was chosen to captain the new team that was filled with players promoted from the youth team.<ref name=\"financial\"/> Kassel was surprisingly successful and spent just two seasons in Oberliga before being promoted back to the 2.Bundesliga.\n\nECK survived their first season back in the 2.Bundesliga and once again quickly become a promotion contender in the league. In 92/93 the Kassel reached the quarter finals in the play-offs before going better in 93/94 and becoming runner-up, being defeated 3-0 in the best of three series by [[Augsburger EV]].\n\n1994 marked the year of the establishment of a new professional and independent top division in German hockey. The Bundesliga was replaced by the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]] (DEL). Upon the formation of the new DEL, a number of clubs from the old Bundesliga and 2.Bundesliga folded or went bankrupt, leaving 18 clubs to fill the top two divisions. Kassel applied and was inducted into DEL, becoming a founding member, the first time the club had reached the top division of German hockey.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.neuss.de/wirtschaft/veroeffentlichungen/gewerbe-post/GewerbePost_2015_1.pdf#page=15 | title= Organizational Heart of the DEL now in Neuss | publisher= Gewerbe-Post | pages= 15 | accessdate= 2018-02-21 | language= German | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180222050155/http://www.neuss.de/wirtschaft/veroeffentlichungen/gewerbe-post/GewerbePost_2015_1.pdf#page=15 | archive-date= 22 February 2018 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nUsing the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] as a base model for the new league, teams became limited liability companies and took on new names often involving pseudonyms from the animal world. EC Kassel was dissolved, and in its place the club formed new two organisations. Ice Hockey Youth Kassel e.V was established to run the operations of the women's and junior programs and act as parent club for the new limited liability company set-up for the men's program, EC Kassel Huskies Sportmanagement GmbH. So within DEL, Kassel officially became known as the Kassel Huskies, named after the [[Siberian husky]].\n\n===Successful years in DEL (1994\u20131998)===\n[[File:Siberian Husky with Blue Eyes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Siberian husky]]\nThe Huskies made an immediate impact in the DEL. At executive level, bankrupt trustee Martin Lepper stepped down from his position at the club now that the Huskies were financially stable. Gerhard Swoboda and Uli Egen took over operations at the club as president and general manager respectively. The Sled Dogs over performed in the league in its first two seasons. Reaching the play-offs for the German title. In both 94/95 and 95/96, the Huskies were defeated in the play-offs at the quarter finals stage by arch rivals [[Frankfurt Lions]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/hessenderby.cfm | title=Kassel Huskies gegen Frankfurt Lions | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025751/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/hessenderby.cfm | archive-date=2009-01-24 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 the \u2018[[Bosman ruling]]\u2019 came into effect in the [[European Union|EU]]. Professional players were now allowed to leave a club for another one for free once their current contract expired. This court decision opened up the European market for ice hockey clubs in Germany. Kassel head coach, Gerhard Brunner, took advantage of the new regulations and brought in an unprecedented number of European players to play for the Huskies. By 1996, Kassel had nine [[Scandinavia]]n players on their books including 1994 Swedish Olympic champion, [[Roger Hansson (ice hockey)|Roger Hansson]].\n\n1996/97 was a milestone year for the Kassel Huskies. They achieved their best ever finish to a season in the club's history. Kassel finished fourth in the regular season standings, qualifying for the championship round. The Sled Dogs improved in the championship round and finished third behind [[K\u00f6lner Haie]] and [[Adler Mannheim]], qualifying for the play-offs. The Huskies defeated [[Starbulls Rosenheim]] and [[EHC Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin]] on route to the Championship final where they came up against Adler Mannheim. Kassel were regarded as underdogs for the best of five final, with Adler having won the regular season and championship round. The Huskies sold 20,000 tickets for finals home match while 3,500 fans filled the exhibition hall in Kassel to watch the matches on TV. The Huskies went on to lose the finals series 3-0 to Mannheim but on 16 April 1997 over 10,000 supporters filled the streets around town hall in Kassel to celebrate the team's success in becoming German runner-up for the first time. Kassel's mayor at the time, Georg Lewandowski, led the celebrations by saying the Huskies should be proud of their achievements given just three years earlier they were playing in the 2nd Bundesliga and now they were the second best team in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_III.cfm | title=Wer dabei war, wird diesen Tag wohl nie vergessen | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025644/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_III.cfm | archive-date=2009-01-24 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe success of 96/97 led the Huskies to qualify for the [[European Hockey League]] for the first time in 1997/98. This was the first time the Huskies got to compete internationally in the club's history. The Sled Dogs brought in former [[Stanley cup]] winner [[Paul DiPietro]] to assist with their European campaign. Kassel, who also had a new head coach in Czech Milan Mokro\u0161, was ultimately unsuccessful in their first European challenge. The Huskies failed to qualify out of the group stage and were eliminated after six matches. Kassel defeated Czech side [[HC V\u00edtkovice]] twice but lost to Swedish team [[F\u00e4rjestad BK]] and Finnish team [[Jokerit Helsinki]] four times (two times each).\n\nThe Huskies were unable to replicate their previous season's success in the DEL in 97/98. They finished midtable in the regular season and failed to qualify for the play-offs. Milan Mokro\u0161 was dismissed at the conclusion of the season and German hall of fame legend [[Hans Zach]] was appointed his successor for 1998/99, maintaining the club's new found importance in the German ice hockey landscape.\n\n===The return of Hans Zach (1998\u20132004)===\n[[Hans Zach]]\u2019s appointment in 98/99 elevated the Huskies program to new found heights. He was both Kassel and German national team head coach at the same time. Zach\u2019s appointment contributed to ice hockey becoming the most popular sport in Kassel, leapfrogging football. Hans introduced a well drilled dogged defensive style of hockey that made the team hard to break down. Zach was instrumental in bringing in national team players to play for Kassel such as [[Daniel Kreutzer]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/interview-mit-hans-zach-wir-werden-es-keinem-leicht-machen-a-182125.html | title= Interview mit Hans Zach \"Wir werden es keinem leicht machen\" (English:Interview with Hans Zach \"We will not make it easy for anyone\") | publisher=www.spiegel.de | first=Gerd | last=M\u00fcnster | date=2002-02-13 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n\nKassel\u2019s performances in the league became very consistent with the club finishing in the top five and qualifying for the play-offs four seasons in a row. On 25 September 2002 Hans\u2019 Huskies defeated the [[N\u00fcrnberg Ice Tigers]] 3-0. The result saw the Sled Dogs move into first place in the DEL league standings for the first and only time in the club's history.\n\nThe solid performances under Zach led the Kassel financial supporter, Simon Kimm, to invest new money into the club. Mr Kimm invested 15 million [[Deutsche Marks]] (around \u20ac7.6 million). The money secured the club and led to plans for the construction of a new Northern Hessen arena to host the Huskies and [[European handball]] team [[MT Melsungen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/eishockey-in-kassel-gesichert-16392324 | title=Eishockey in Kassel gesichert (English:Hockey in Kassel secured) | publisher=www.berliner-zeitung.de | first= | last= | date=2001-11-29 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n[[File: Bully at Mannheim versus Kassel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Match between Adler Mannheim and Kassel at SAP Arena]]\nBefore the start of the 2002/03 season, Kassel Huskies were rocked by news of the departure of Hans Zach to rival DEL club [[K\u00f6lner Haie]] (Cologne Sharks). The Sharks were seven time German champions and one of the best teams in the league. Hans justified the switch stating he was tired of players he trained moving onto more prestigious clubs. Assistant coach, [[Axel Kammerer]], was named his successor.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/zach-verlaesst-kassel-huskies-16297170 | title=Zach verl\u00e4sst Kassel Huskies (English:Zach leaves Kassel Huskies) | publisher=www.berliner-zeitung.de | first= | last= | date=2002-01-12 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n\nKassel's standing suffered after Zach left. The 2002/03 season saw the Huskies finished outside the top five for the first time in five seasons. They still qualified for finals by finishing seventh but in the quarter-finals they met the Cologne Sharks and Hans Zach. The best of seven series went down to the wire in the seventh match. Ultimately Kassel lost game seven and Zach's Sharks went on to reach the final.  Off the ice, there was constant rotation in the backroom with Kassel going through four head coaches. The conveyor belt of head coaches led to inconsistent approaches to tactics and cohesion on the ice with both attacking and defensive approaches implemented.\n\nIn 2003/04 the Huskies had an uneventful DEL season finishing eleventh in the league and missing out on the play-offs. Kassel did however perform well in the newly established [[Deutscher Eishockey-Pokal]] (German Cup). The Cup was being contested for the second time in 03/04 and the Huskies had progressed from the first round to reach the final. Along the way the Sled Dogs defeated [[Dresdner Eisl\u00f6wen]] (round 1), [[Landshut Cannibals]] (round 2), [[Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin]] (QF) and [[SC Riessersee]] (SF). The final was held at the [[K\u00f6lnarena]] on 10 February 2004. The Huskies once again came up against their former coach Hans Zach and the Cologne Sharks. The Sharks got off to a good start in the first period and took a 2-1 lead into the first break. From there Kassel found it impossible to break down the Sharks\u2019 defence and Hans once against orchestrated a famous victory over his former team for the second time in two seasons since leaving.\n\n===Relegation and promotion (2004\u20132008)===\nAfter eleven straight years of participation in the highest level of hockey in Germany, Kassel suffered their worst performance in the league in 2004\u201305. The Huskies lost 35 of 52 matches in the regular season and for the first time they participated in the relegation playoffs (play-downs as they are known in Germany). In the playoffs, Kassel came up against [[Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg]] in a best-of-seven match series. Kassel lost match seven, 2\u20133, to lose the series and confirm their relegation to [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]]. However, the Huskies were saved from relegation when Wolfsburg failed to secure a DEL licence for the following season and they were relegated instead of Kassel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kicker.de/home/317082/artikel_del-verweigert-wolfsburg-die-lizenz.html | title=Kassel Huskies bleiben erstklassig: DEL verweigert Wolfsburg die Lizenz | publisher=[[kicker (sports magazine)|kicker Sportmagazin]] | first=Marcel | last=Grzanna | date=28 June 2005 | accessdate=24 March 2020 | language=German | trans-title=Kassel Huskies remain first class: DEL denies Wolfsburg the license }}</ref>\n\nThe off-season saw the team enter crisis with major shareholder Simon Kimm withdrawing his financial support for the team and resigning from the club. The Huskies were once again threatened with bankruptcy. In the eleventh hour the club secured a new major shareholder, Rainer Lippe, who took up the position of managing director with the Huskies.

Kassel finished the regular season second last in the table with just 20 wins from 52 matches. This meant once again the Huskies would face a relegation playoff for the second season in a row. Kassel's opponent for the playoffs was [[F\u00fcchse Duisburg]]. The series went for five matches with Kassel suffering defeat, 1\u20134.

During the promotion playoffs, Kassel clean swept their quarter and semi-final series\u2019 against [[Eisb\u00e4ren Regensburg]] and [[EHC M\u00fcnchen]].

During the promotion playoffs Kassel once more reached the final, defeating [[ETC Crimmitschau]] and [[Schwenninger Wild Wings]] on the way. In the final the Huskies faced [[Landshut Cannibals]] in a best of five match series. Kassel commissioned a special train to move fans to and from finals matches in the city as well as in [[Landshut]]. This train was nicknamed the \u2018Happy train\u2019.

Hercules also appears at special events hosted by the club. While the husky image has changed a number of times on the club's logo, the mascot has been updated just once, in 2015, with a softer friendlier more 'plush' look to Hercules.

The club currently competes in [[DEL2]], the second level of ice hockey in Germany. The Huskies were founded in 1977 and have competed in the top five levels of the hockey in Germany since that time. Kassel's home barn is the [[Eissporthalle Kassel]], which has a capacity of 6,100. The club's nickname is the Sled Dogs. Kassel has won two second level championships in 2008 and 2016 and have won one top level junior championship in 2004. The Huskies have finished runner-up in Germany's top league, [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]], in [[1996\u201397 DEL season|1997]] and have been beaten finalists in the [[German Cup (ice hockey)|Deutscher Eishockey-Pokal]] in 2004.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ice Hockey in Kassel before and founding of the club===\n[[File:Schlossteich-1901.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skating on the castle pond, winter 1900\u20131901]]\nIn the 19th century, the [[Karlsaue|Karlsaue park]] was already a popular place for [[ice skating]] during the winter months on the frozen [[Fulda (river)|Fulda river]].<ref>Abhandlungen u. Report of the Association for Natural History to Kassel, 1900, p. 2.</ref> Skating in Kassel at the time was called \u2018foot skating\u2019.<ref>Journal of the Association for Hessian History, J.J. Bohn\u00e9, 1911, p. 302.</ref> The earliest example of [[ice hockey]] being played in Kassel came from a 1926 photo from the court photographer Carl Eberth, depicting young people playing ice hockey on the frozen Fulda.\n\nIn 1966, Helmut Spohr, a former [[association football|football]] player for [[KSV Hessen Kassel]], introduced the idea of establishing an ice hockey club. Spohr teamed up with Viktor Klement to form what was the first ice hockey team in Kassel, ESV Jahn Kassel. They managed to source some disused firefighting water hoses and in winter they built an outdoors ice rink with the hoses on top of a tennis court in the park as there were no ice machines. Players started to join in the games and eventually they had enough for a team to play other regional social community groups in [[Hannover]] and [[Bad Nauheim]].<ref name=\"establishment\">{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie.cfm | title=Seit mehr als 40 Jahren Eishockey in Kassel | publisher=Kassel Huskies | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025816/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie.cfm | archive-date=24 January 2009 | language=German}}</ref>\n\n<div style=\"clear:right;float: right; text-align: right; padding-left: 15px; font-size: 95%; \">\n{| class=\"wikitable zebra\" style=\"width: 230px; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| League\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Finish\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Finals\n|-\n| 1977/78 || [[Regionalliga (ice hockey)|RL]] || 5th || {{tooltip|''DNQ''|Did not qualify}}\n|-\n| 1978/79 || RL || 5th || ''DNQ''\n|-\n| 1979/80 || RL || 1st || 2nd\n|}\n</div>\n\nKassel Huskies was established 19 February 1977 as ''ESG Kassel Ice Sports Community''.<ref name=\"establishment\"/> The club was established the same year as the first indoor ice rink was built in Kassel, the [[Eissporthalle Kassel]], by Edith and Simon Kimm.<ref name=\"earlyyears\">{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_I.cfm | title=Wissen sie noch, wann die Kassel Huskies Vizemeister waren? | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025837/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_I.cfm | archive-date=24 January 2009 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nESG Kassel began life playing in the [[Regionalliga (ice hockey)|Regionalliga]], the fourth division of German ice hockey, in the 1977/78 Regionalliga West season. Their first official match was played on 30 October 1977 against SV Brackwede. 900 spectators turned out for the opening match. Kassel, led by Canadian head coach Danny Coutu, lost their opening match 2-5. Interest in the team and the sport grew in northern Hessen and soon the team was achieving public attendance at matches of up to 3,000 people in their opening season. Kassel went on to finish midtable in 5th place.<ref name=\"establishment\"/>\n\nESG Kassel repeated their form in 1978/79 by finishing fifth in the league table and missing out on finals. However, in 1979/80, the team finished first in the league standings, qualifying for their first finals series and getting promoted to [[Oberliga (ice hockey)|Oberliga]].

Led by players who would go on to become legends of the club, Herbert Heinrich and Shane Tarves, Kassel challenged for promotion to the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2.Bundesliga]].<ref name=\"earlyyears\"/> In 1981/82 the team finished second in the league and runner-up in the finals to qualify for promotion to 2.Bundesliga. However, due to financial limitations the club was unable to accept the promotion and remained in Oberliga. The following season the City of Kassel stepped in to shore up financial support of the team and under the guidance of Finnish coach Jorma Siitarinen, Kassel finished top of the table and were promoted to 2.Bundesliga.\n\nKassel staved off relegation back to the Oberliga in their first two seasons in the 2.Bundesliga by winning their relegation play-offs. The club reinvested in the playing roster and brought in a number of high-profile expensive players to the club including Dave O'Brien and Miroslav Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to start to challenge for promotion to the [[Eishockey-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]]. The club was again in a risky financial position after the investments in the roster and needed promotion to the top division to help pay off the debts.<ref name=\"earlyyears\"/>\n\nESG finished the 1985\u201386 season in third spot, missing promotion by two points. A decisive local Hessen derby against rivals Eintracht Frankfurt (today [[L\u00f6wen Frankfurt]]) is regarded as the match promotion was lost. Kassel led 3-0 in the match but Frankfurt came from behind to defeat them 4-3. The following season, Kassel again challenged for the league title and promotion but finished second behind [[BSC Preussen]].

The club remained in the 2.Bundesliga for season 87/88, however due to the high operating costs of competing in the level two league it was decided to voluntarily be relegated back to Oberliga at the conclusion of the season. The roster was dismantled by new coach Richard Piechutta. Shane Tarves was chosen to captain the new team that was filled with players promoted from the youth team.<ref name=\"financial\"/> Kassel was surprisingly successful and spent just two seasons in Oberliga before being promoted back to the 2.Bundesliga.\n\nECK survived their first season back in the 2.Bundesliga and once again quickly become a promotion contender in the league. In 92/93 the Kassel reached the quarter finals in the play-offs before going better in 93/94 and becoming runner-up, being defeated 3-0 in the best of three series by [[Augsburger EV]].\n\n1994 marked the year of the establishment of a new professional and independent top division in German hockey. The Bundesliga was replaced by the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]] (DEL). Upon the formation of the new DEL, a number of clubs from the old Bundesliga and 2.Bundesliga folded or went bankrupt, leaving 18 clubs to fill the top two divisions. Kassel applied and was inducted into DEL, becoming a founding member, the first time the club had reached the top division of German hockey.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.neuss.de/wirtschaft/veroeffentlichungen/gewerbe-post/GewerbePost_2015_1.pdf#page=15 | title= Organizational Heart of the DEL now in Neuss | publisher= Gewerbe-Post | pages= 15 | accessdate= 2018-02-21 | language= German | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180222050155/http://www.neuss.de/wirtschaft/veroeffentlichungen/gewerbe-post/GewerbePost_2015_1.pdf#page=15 | archive-date= 22 February 2018 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nUsing the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] as a base model for the new league, teams became limited liability companies and took on new names often involving pseudonyms from the animal world. EC Kassel was dissolved, and in its place the club formed new two organisations. Ice Hockey Youth Kassel e.V was established to run the operations of the women's and junior programs and act as parent club for the new limited liability company set-up for the men's program, EC Kassel Huskies Sportmanagement GmbH. So within DEL, Kassel officially became known as the Kassel Huskies, named after the [[Siberian husky]].\n\n===Successful years in DEL (1994\u20131998)===\n[[File:Siberian Husky with Blue Eyes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Siberian husky]]\nThe Huskies made an immediate impact in the DEL. At executive level, bankrupt trustee Martin Lepper stepped down from his position at the club now that the Huskies were financially stable. Gerhard Swoboda and Uli Egen took over operations at the club as president and general manager respectively. The Sled Dogs over performed in the league in its first two seasons. Reaching the play-offs for the German title. In both 94/95 and 95/96, the Huskies were defeated in the play-offs at the quarter finals stage by arch rivals [[Frankfurt Lions]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/hessenderby.cfm | title=Kassel Huskies gegen Frankfurt Lions | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025751/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/hessenderby.cfm | archive-date=2009-01-24 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 the \u2018[[Bosman ruling]]\u2019 came into effect in the [[European Union|EU]]. Professional players were now allowed to leave a club for another one for free once their current contract expired. This court decision opened up the European market for ice hockey clubs in Germany. Kassel head coach, Gerhard Brunner, took advantage of the new regulations and brought in an unprecedented number of European players to play for the Huskies. By 1996, Kassel had nine [[Scandinavia]]n players on their books including 1994 Swedish Olympic champion, [[Roger Hansson (ice hockey)|Roger Hansson]].\n\n1996/97 was a milestone year for the Kassel Huskies. They achieved their best ever finish to a season in the club's history. Kassel finished fourth in the regular season standings, qualifying for the championship round. The Sled Dogs improved in the championship round and finished third behind [[K\u00f6lner Haie]] and [[Adler Mannheim]], qualifying for the play-offs. The Huskies defeated [[Starbulls Rosenheim]] and [[EHC Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin]] on route to the Championship final where they came up against Adler Mannheim. Kassel were regarded as underdogs for the best of five final, with Adler having won the regular season and championship round. The Huskies sold 20,000 tickets for finals home match while 3,500 fans filled the exhibition hall in Kassel to watch the matches on TV. The Huskies went on to lose the finals series 3-0 to Mannheim but on 16 April 1997 over 10,000 supporters filled the streets around town hall in Kassel to celebrate the team's success in becoming German runner-up for the first time. Kassel's mayor at the time, Georg Lewandowski, led the celebrations by saying the Huskies should be proud of their achievements given just three years earlier they were playing in the 2nd Bundesliga and now they were the second best team in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_III.cfm | title=Wer dabei war, wird diesen Tag wohl nie vergessen | publisher=Kassel Huskies | first=Oliver | last=Zehe | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025644/http://www.huskies-online.de/archiv/nostalgie_III.cfm | archive-date=2009-01-24 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe success of 96/97 led the Huskies to qualify for the [[European Hockey League]] for the first time in 1997/98. This was the first time the Huskies got to compete internationally in the club's history. The Sled Dogs brought in former [[Stanley cup]] winner [[Paul DiPietro]] to assist with their European campaign. Kassel, who also had a new head coach in Czech Milan Mokro\u0161, was ultimately unsuccessful in their first European challenge. The Huskies failed to qualify out of the group stage and were eliminated after six matches. Kassel defeated Czech side [[HC V\u00edtkovice]] twice but lost to Swedish team [[F\u00e4rjestad BK]] and Finnish team [[Jokerit Helsinki]] four times (two times each).\n\nThe Huskies were unable to replicate their previous season's success in the DEL in 97/98. They finished midtable in the regular season and failed to qualify for the play-offs. Milan Mokro\u0161 was dismissed at the conclusion of the season and German hall of fame legend [[Hans Zach]] was appointed his successor for 1998/99, maintaining the club's new found importance in the German ice hockey landscape.\n\n===The return of Hans Zach (1998\u20132004)===\n[[Hans Zach]]\u2019s appointment in 98/99 elevated the Huskies program to new found heights. He was both Kassel and German national team head coach at the same time. Zach\u2019s appointment contributed to ice hockey becoming the most popular sport in Kassel, leapfrogging football. Hans introduced a well drilled dogged defensive style of hockey that made the team hard to break down. Zach was instrumental in bringing in national team players to play for Kassel such as [[Daniel Kreutzer]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/interview-mit-hans-zach-wir-werden-es-keinem-leicht-machen-a-182125.html | title= Interview mit Hans Zach \"Wir werden es keinem leicht machen\" (English:Interview with Hans Zach \"We will not make it easy for anyone\") | publisher=www.spiegel.de | first=Gerd | last=M\u00fcnster | date=2002-02-13 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n\nKassel\u2019s performances in the league became very consistent with the club finishing in the top five and qualifying for the play-offs four seasons in a row. On 25 September 2002 Hans\u2019 Huskies defeated the [[N\u00fcrnberg Ice Tigers]] 3-0. The result saw the Sled Dogs move into first place in the DEL league standings for the first and only time in the club's history.\n\nThe solid performances under Zach led the Kassel financial supporter, Simon Kimm, to invest new money into the club. Mr Kimm invested 15 million [[Deutsche Marks]] (around \u20ac7.6 million). The money secured the club and led to plans for the construction of a new Northern Hessen arena to host the Huskies and [[European handball]] team [[MT Melsungen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/eishockey-in-kassel-gesichert-16392324 | title=Eishockey in Kassel gesichert (English:Hockey in Kassel secured) | publisher=www.berliner-zeitung.de | first= | last= | date=2001-11-29 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n[[File: Bully at Mannheim versus Kassel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Match between Adler Mannheim and Kassel at SAP Arena]]\nBefore the start of the 2002/03 season, Kassel Huskies were rocked by news of the departure of Hans Zach to rival DEL club [[K\u00f6lner Haie]] (Cologne Sharks). The Sharks were seven time German champions and one of the best teams in the league. Hans justified the switch stating he was tired of players he trained moving onto more prestigious clubs. Assistant coach, [[Axel Kammerer]], was named his successor.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/zach-verlaesst-kassel-huskies-16297170 | title=Zach verl\u00e4sst Kassel Huskies (English:Zach leaves Kassel Huskies) | publisher=www.berliner-zeitung.de | first= | last= | date=2002-01-12 | accessdate=2019-09-24 | language=German }}</ref>\n\nKassel's standing suffered after Zach left. The 2002/03 season saw the Huskies finished outside the top five for the first time in five seasons. They still qualified for finals by finishing seventh but in the quarter-finals they met the Cologne Sharks and Hans Zach. The best of seven series went down to the wire in the seventh match. Ultimately Kassel lost game seven and Zach's Sharks went on to reach the final.  Off the ice, there was constant rotation in the backroom with Kassel going through four head coaches. The conveyor belt of head coaches led to inconsistent approaches to tactics and cohesion on the ice with both attacking and defensive approaches implemented.\n\nIn 2003/04 the Huskies had an uneventful DEL season finishing eleventh in the league and missing out on the play-offs. Kassel did however perform well in the newly established [[Deutscher Eishockey-Pokal]] (German Cup). The Cup was being contested for the second time in 03/04 and the Huskies had progressed from the first round to reach the final. Along the way the Sled Dogs defeated [[Dresdner Eisl\u00f6wen]] (round 1), [[Landshut Cannibals]] (round 2), [[Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin]] (QF) and [[SC Riessersee]] (SF). The final was held at the [[K\u00f6lnarena]] on 10 February 2004. The Huskies once again came up against their former coach Hans Zach and the Cologne Sharks. The Sharks got off to a good start in the first period and took a 2-1 lead into the first break. From there Kassel found it impossible to break down the Sharks\u2019 defence and Hans once against orchestrated a famous victory over his former team for the second time in two seasons since leaving.\n\n===Relegation and promotion (2004\u20132008)===\nAfter eleven straight years of participation in the highest level of hockey in Germany, Kassel suffered their worst performance in the league in 2004\u201305. The Huskies lost 35 of 52 matches in the regular season and for the first time they participated in the relegation playoffs (play-downs as they are known in Germany). In the playoffs, Kassel came up against [[Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg]] in a best-of-seven match series. Kassel lost match seven, 2\u20133, to lose the series and confirm their relegation to [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]]. However, the Huskies were saved from relegation when Wolfsburg failed to secure a DEL licence for the following season and they were relegated instead of Kassel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kicker.de/home/317082/artikel_del-verweigert-wolfsburg-die-lizenz.html | title=Kassel Huskies bleiben erstklassig: DEL verweigert Wolfsburg die Lizenz | publisher=[[kicker (sports magazine)|kicker Sportmagazin]] | first=Marcel | last=Grzanna | date=28 June 2005 | accessdate=24 March 2020 | language=German | trans-title=Kassel Huskies remain first class: DEL denies Wolfsburg the license }}</ref>\n\nThe off-season saw the team enter crisis with major shareholder Simon Kimm withdrawing his financial support for the team and resigning from the club. The Huskies were once again threatened with bankruptcy. In the eleventh hour the club secured a new major shareholder, Rainer Lippe, who took up the position of managing director with the Huskies.

Kassel finished the regular season second last in the table with just 20 wins from 52 matches. This meant once again the Huskies would face a relegation playoff for the second season in a row. Kassel's opponent for the playoffs was [[F\u00fcchse Duisburg]]. The series went for five matches with Kassel suffering defeat, 1\u20134.

Kassel had not trademarked the logo and a Scottish manufacturer claimed the logo and trademarked it for themselves. Kassel was forced to redesign, and a new design was selected for the next season. The new logo proved unpopular with supporters and the Huskies redesigned the logo for a second time after just one season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eishockey.info/eishockey/WebApp?cmd=displayArtikelSeite&artikel=12927 | title=Huskies reagieren auf Fan-Kritik: Logo wurde erneut \u00fcberarbeitet | publisher=www.eishockey.info | first= | last= | date=3 July 2006 | accessdate=24 March 2020 | language=German | trans-title=Huskies react to fan criticism: Logo revised again }}</ref>\n\nIn the second division, Kassel wasted no time establishing their platform for immediate promotion back to the DEL. The Huskies were named league premiers at the conclusion of the 2006\u201307 regular season, having topped the table by 13 points ahead of [[Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg]]. During the promotion playoffs, Kassel clean swept their quarter and semi-final series\u2019 against [[Eisb\u00e4ren Regensburg]] and [[EHC M\u00fcnchen]].

During the promotion playoffs Kassel once more reached the final, defeating [[ETC Crimmitschau]] and [[Schwenninger Wild Wings]] on the way. In the final the Huskies faced [[Landshut Cannibals]] in a best of five match series. Kassel commissioned a special train to move fans to and from finals matches in the city as well as in [[Landshut]]. This train was nicknamed the \u2018Happy train\u2019. Kassel won the series, 3\u20132, thanks to an overtime winner in game 5 by [[Drew Bannister]].

The Huskies defeated the previous season\u2019s runner-up, [[K\u00f6lner Haie]], 5\u20131 but the Sled Dogs could not maintain the form and ended the season in 14th place (out of sixteen teams).\n[[File:Huskies-Fans Demonstration.jpg|thumb|200px|Kassel fans rally to save the team in 2009]]\n[[File:Rainer Lippe.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rainer Lippe, owner of the Kassel Huskies]]\nDuring the summer offseason, the Huskies entered into a financial crisis with the withdrawal of financial sponsorship of major sponsor [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Genuine Parts]]. The financial uncertainty threatened the team's DEL licence and Rainer Lippe considered the sale of the license and his resignation as manager in order to ensure that the Kassel Huskies remained in the league. On 9 May 2009, over 1,000 Kassel locals formed a rally and marched through downtown Kassel in support of the team. The then Kassel mayor, [[Timeline of Kassel#21st century|Bertram Hilgen]], declared his support for the team and rallied businesses and the people of Kassel to donate to the cause. Over the course of May more fund raising events were held including \u20ac20 blood donations with the motto 'Heart for the Huskies'.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg Graduate School of Management.'' The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory. Even before the Kellogg gift, the school had been expanding its research-focused faculty: In 1978 alone, the school added six additional \"named\" professorships and two new research professorships.<ref name=\"Cent\"/>\n\nIn 2001, in an effort to improve the school's image, its name was shortened to the ''Kellogg School of Management''.<ref name=\"Cent\">{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111051745/http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|archive-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history (2009 - today) ===\nIn June 2009, Kellogg announced that [[Dipak C.

Later in 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building at the northeast corner of its Evanston campus to serve as Kellogg's new home. The new facility, called the Global Hub, opened in March 2017 adjacent to Lake Michigan and includes classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces, and administrative offices. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/about/global-hub.aspx|title=Global Hub \u2013 Kellogg School of Management \u2013 Northwestern|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://menlocoaching.com/kellogg-global-hub/|title=Assistant Dean Kate Smith on Kellogg's Global Hub|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Kellogg announced that [[Sally Blount]] would replace Sunil Chopra as dean, starting in July.

If a student does not elect a major \"General Management\" will appear on their transcript. In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.\n\n====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====\nStudents declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum \u2013 a for-credit course with limited enrollment \u2013 students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg Graduate School of Management.'' The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory.

Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives.

The bandwidth of white noise is limited in practice by the mechanism of noise generation, by the transmission medium and by finite observation capabilities. Thus, random signals are considered \"white noise\" if they are observed to have a flat spectrum over the range of frequencies that are relevant to the context. For an [[audio signal]], the relevant range is the band of audible sound frequencies (between 20 and 20,000 [[hertz|Hz]]). Such a signal is heard by the human ear as a ''hissing sound'', resembling the /h/ sound in a sustained aspiration. On the other hand, the /sh/ sound in \"ash\" is a colored noise because it has a formant structure. In [[music]] and [[acoustics]], the term \"white noise\" may be used for any signal that has a similar hissing sound.<!-- Other uses of the term -->\n\nThe term white noise is sometimes used in the context of [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|phylogenetically based statistical methods]] to refer to a lack of phylogenetic pattern in comparative data.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Developmental trait evolution in trilobites |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue= 2|pages=314\u2013329 |year=2011 |pmid= 22276531|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01447.x|url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Fusco_et_al_2011_trilobites.pdf |last1=Fusco |first1=G|last2=Garland |first2=T., Jr |last3=Hunt |first3=G  |last4=Hughes |first4=NC}}</ref>  It is sometimes used analogously in nontechnical contexts to mean \"random talk without meaningful contents\".<ref name=shipman>\n  [[Claire Shipman]] (2005), ''[[Good Morning America]]'': \"The political [[rhetoric]] on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] is white noise.''

Even a binary signal which can only take on the values 1 or \u20131 will be white if the sequence is statistically uncorrelated. Noise having a continuous distribution, such as a [[normal distribution]], can of course be white.\n\nIt is often incorrectly assumed that [[Gaussian noise]] (i.e., noise with a Gaussian amplitude distribution{{snd}}see [[normal distribution]]) necessarily refers to white noise, yet neither property implies the other. Gaussianity refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value, in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes, while the term 'white' refers to the way the signal power is distributed (i.e., independently) over time or among frequencies.\n\nWhite noise is the generalized mean-square derivative of the [[Wiener process]] or [[Brownian motion]].\n\nA generalization to [[random element]]s on infinite dimensional spaces, such as [[random field]]s, is the [[nuclear space|white noise measure]].\n\n==Practical applications==\n\n===Music===\nWhite noise is commonly used in the production of [[electronic music]], usually either directly or as an input for a filter to create other types of noise signal. It is used extensively in [[audio synthesis]], typically to recreate percussive instruments such as [[cymbal]]s or [[snare drum]]s which have high noise content in their frequency domain. A simple example of white noise is a nonexistent radio station (static).\n\n===Electronics engineering===\nWhite noise is also used to obtain the [[impulse response]] of an electrical circuit, in particular of [[amplifier]]s and other audio equipment. It is not used for testing loudspeakers as its spectrum contains too great an amount of high frequency content. [[Pink noise]], which differs from white noise in that it has equal energy in each octave, is used for testing transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones.\n\n===Computing===\nWhite noise is used as the basis of some [[hardware random number generator|random number generators]].

Fessler (1998), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218214647if_/http://andywilliamson.org/_/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/White-Noise.pdf On Transformations of Random Vectors.]'' Technical report 314, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Univ. of Michigan. ([[PDF]])</ref>\n\nA necessary (but, [[normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent|in general, not sufficient]]) condition for statistical independence of two variables is that they be [[correlation|statistically uncorrelated]]; that is, their [[covariance]] is zero. Therefore, the  [[covariance matrix]] ''R'' of the components of a white noise vector ''w'' with ''n'' elements must be an ''n'' by ''n'' [[diagonal matrix]], where each diagonal element ''R\u1d62\u1d62'' is the [[variance]] of component ''w\u1d62''; and the [[Correlation and dependence#Correlation matrices|correlation]] matrix must be the ''n'' by ''n'' identity matrix.\n\nIn particular, if in addition to being independent every variable in ''w'' also has a [[normal distribution]] with zero mean and the same variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>, ''w'' is said to be a Gaussian white noise vector. In that case, the joint distribution of ''w'' is a [[multivariate normal distribution]]; the independence between the variables then implies that the distribution has [[elliptical distribution|spherical symmetry]] in ''n''-dimensional space. Therefore, any [[orthogonal transformation]] of the vector will result in a Gaussian white random vector. In particular, under most types of [[discrete Fourier transform]], such as [[fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[discrete Hartley transform|Hartley]], the transform ''W'' of ''w'' will be a Gaussian white noise vector, too; that is, the ''n'' Fourier coefficients of ''w'' will be independent Gaussian variables with zero mean and the same variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>.\n\nThe [[power spectrum]] ''P'' of a random vector ''w'' can be defined as the expected value of the squared modulus of each coefficient of its Fourier transform ''W'', that is, ''P\u1d62'' = E(|''W\u1d62''|\u00b2). Under that definition, a Gaussian white noise vector will have a perfectly flat power spectrum, with ''P\u1d62''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''&sigma;\u00b2 for all&nbsp;''i''.\n\nIf ''w'' is a white random vector, but not a Gaussian one, its Fourier coefficients ''W\u1d62'' will not be completely independent of each other; although for large ''n'' and common probability distributions the dependencies are very subtle, and their pairwise correlations can be assumed to be zero.\n\nOften the weaker condition \"statistically uncorrelated\" is used in the definition of white noise, instead of \"statistically independent\". However some of the commonly expected properties of white noise (such as flat power spectrum) may not hold for this weaker version. Under this assumption, the stricter version can be referred to explicitly as independent white noise vector.<ref name=\"ezivot\">\n  Eric Zivot and Jiahui Wang (2006), [http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ584/notes/timeSeriesConcepts.pdf Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS]. Second Edition. ([[PDF]])\n</ref>{{rp|p.60}} Other authors use strongly white and weakly white instead.<ref name=\"diebold\">\n  [[Francis X. Diebold]] (2007), ''[https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/Teaching221/FullBook.pdf Elements of Forecasting],'' 4th edition. ([[PDF]])\n</ref>\n\nAn example of a random vector that is \"Gaussian white noise\" in the weak but not in the strong sense is ''x''=[''x''\u2081,''x''\u2082] where ''x''\u2081 is a normal random variable with zero mean, and ''x''\u2082 is equal to +''x''\u2081 or to \u2212''x''\u2081, with equal probability. These two variables are uncorrelated and individually normally distributed, but they are not jointly normally distributed and are not independent. If ''x'' is rotated by 45 degrees, its two components will still be uncorrelated, but their distribution will no longer be normal.\n\nIn some situations one may relax the definition by allowing each component of a white random vector ''w'' to have non-zero expected value <math>\\mu</math>. In [[image processing]] especially, where samples are typically restricted to positive values, one often takes <math>\\mu</math> to be one half of the maximum sample value. In that case, the Fourier coefficient ''W''\u2080 corresponding to the zero-frequency component (essentially, the average of the ''w''_i) will also have a non-zero expected value <math>\\mu\\sqrt{n}</math>; and the power spectrum ''P'' will be flat only over the non-zero frequencies.\n\n===Discrete-time white noise===\nA discrete-time [[stochastic process]] <math>W[n]</math> is a generalization of random vectors with a finite number of components to infinitely many components. A discrete-time stochastic process <math>W[n]</math> is called white noise if its mean does not depend on the time <math>n</math> and is equal to zero, i.e. <math>\\operatorname{E}[W[n]] = 0</math> and if the autocorrelation function <math>R_{W}[n] = \\operatorname{E}[W[k+n]W[k]]</math> only depends on <math>n</math> but not on <math>k</math> and has a nonzero value only for <math>n = 0</math>, i.e. <math>R_{W}[n] = \\sigma^2 \\delta [n]</math>.\n\n===Continuous-time white noise===\nIn order to define the notion of \"white noise\" in the theory of [[continuous-time]] signals, one must replace the concept of a \"random vector\" by a continuous-time random signal; that is, a random process that generates a function <math>w</math> of a real-valued parameter <math>t</math>.\n\nSuch a process is said to be white noise in the strongest sense if the value <math>w(t)</math> for any time <math>t</math> is a random variable that is statistically independent of its entire history before <math>t</math>. A weaker definition requires independence only between the values <math>w(t_1)</math> and <math>w(t_2)</math> at every pair of distinct times <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math>. An even weaker definition requires only that such pairs <math>w(t_1)</math> and <math>w(t_2)</math> be uncorrelated.<ref name=econterms>\n  [http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/whitenoise.htm ''White noise process'']. By Econterms via About.com. Accessed on 2013-02-12.\n</ref>  As in the discrete case, some authors adopt the weaker definition for \"white noise\", and use the qualifier independent to refer to either of the stronger definitions. Others use weakly white and strongly white to distinguish between them.\n\nHowever, a precise definition of these concepts is not trivial, because some quantities that are  finite sums in the finite discrete case must be replaced by integrals that may not converge. Indeed, the set of all possible instances of a signal <math>w</math> is no longer a finite-dimensional space <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, but an infinite-dimensional [[function space]]. Moreover, by any definition a white noise signal <math>w</math> would have to be essentially discontinuous at every point; therefore even the simplest operations on <math>w</math>, like integration over a finite interval, require advanced mathematical machinery.\n\nSome authors require each value <math>w(t)</math> to be a real-valued random variable with expectation <math>\\mu</math> and some finite variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>. Then the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(w(t_1)\\cdot w(t_2))</math> between the values at two times <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math> is well-defined: it is zero if the times are distinct, and <math>\\sigma^2</math> if they are equal. However, by this definition, the integral\n: <math>W_{[a,a+r]} = \\int_a^{a+r} w(t)\\, dt</math>\nover any interval with positive width <math>r</math> would be simply the width times the expectation: <math>r\\mu</math>. This property would render the concept inadequate as a model of physical \"white noise\" signals.\n\nTherefore, most authors define the signal <math>w</math> indirectly by specifying non-zero values for the integrals of <math>w(t)</math> and <math>|w(t)|^2</math> over any interval <math>[a,a+r]</math>, as a function of its width <math>r</math>. In this approach, however, the value of <math>w(t)</math> at an isolated time cannot be defined as a real-valued random variable{{Citation needed|reason=an authoritative work on white noise given one such example should be given|date=January 2017}}. Also the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(w(t_1)\\cdot w(t_2))</math> becomes infinite when <math>t_1=t_2</math>; and the [[autocorrelation]] function <math>\\mathrm{R}(t_1,t_2)</math> must be defined as <math>N \\delta(t_1-t_2)</math>, where <math>N</math> is some real constant and <math>\\delta</math> is [[Dirac delta function|Dirac's \"function\"]].\n\nIn this approach, one usually specifies that the integral <math>W_I</math> of <math>w(t)</math> over an interval <math>I=[a,b]</math> is a real random variable with normal distribution, zero mean, and variance <math>(b-a)\\sigma^2</math>; and also that the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(W_I\\cdot W_J)</math> of the integrals <math>W_I</math>, <math>W_J</math> is <math>r\\sigma^2</math>, where <math>r</math> is the width of the intersection <math>I\\cap J</math> of the two intervals <math>I,J</math>. This model is called a Gaussian white noise signal (or process).\n\n==Mathematical applications==\n\n===Time series analysis and regression===\nIn [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]] one often assumes that an observed series of data values is the sum of a series of values generated by a [[deterministic]] [[linear model|linear process]], depending on certain [[Dependent and independent variables|independent (explanatory) variables]], and on a series of random noise values. Then [[regression analysis]] is used to infer the parameters of the model process from the observed data, e.g. by [[ordinary least squares]], and to [[hypothesis testing|test the null hypothesis]] that each of the parameters is zero against the alternative hypothesis that it is non-zero. Hypothesis testing typically assumes that the noise values are mutually uncorrelated with zero mean and have the same Gaussian probability distribution{{snd}}in other words, that the noise is white. If there is non-zero correlation between the noise values underlying different observations then the estimated model parameters are still [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]], but estimates of their uncertainties (such as [[confidence interval]]s) will be biased (not accurate on average). This is also true if the noise is [[heteroskedasticity|heteroskedastic]]{{snd}}that is, if it has different variances for different data points.\n\nAlternatively, in the subset of regression analysis known as [[time series analysis]] there are often no explanatory variables other than the past values of the variable being modeled (the [[dependent variable]]). In this case the noise process is often modeled as a [[Moving average model|moving average]] process, in which the current value of the dependent variable depends on current and past values of a sequential white noise process.\n\n===Random vector transformations===\nThese two ideas are crucial in applications such as [[channel estimation]] and [[Mixing console#Channel equalization|channel equalization]] in [[telecommunication|communications]] and [[sound reproduction|audio]]. These concepts are also used in [[data compression]].\n\n<!-- This does not seem to be incorrect but seems to be original research, sort of. Needs to be trimmed to the bare essentials. -->\nIn particular, by a suitable linear transformation (a [[coloring transformation]]), a white random vector can be used to produce a \"non-white\" random vector (that is, a list of random variables) whose elements have a prescribed [[covariance matrix]]. Conversely, a random vector with known covariance matrix can be transformed into a white random vector by a suitable [[whitening transformation]].\n\n==Generation==\nWhite noise may be generated digitally with a [[digital signal processor]], [[microprocessor]], or [[microcontroller]]. Generating white noise typically entails feeding an appropriate stream of random numbers to a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. The quality of the white noise will depend on the quality of the algorithm used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://qualityassignmenthelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gaussian-noise_How-to-Generate-.pdf |title=How to Generate White Gaussian Noise |author=Matt Donadio |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colors of noise}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bochner\u2013Minlos theorem]]\n*[[Brownian noise]]\n*[[Dirac delta function]]\n*[[Electronic noise]]\n*[[Independent component analysis]]\n*[[Noise (physics)]]\n*[[Noise (video)]]\n*[[Principal components analysis]]\n*[[Sound masking]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|White noise}}\n\n{{Noise}}\n{{Stochastic processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Noise}}\n[[Category:Noise (electronics)]]\n[[Category:Statistical signal processing]]\n[[Category:Data compression]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Colors of noise}}\n<!--The \"Colors of noise\" navbox is in the See Also section.

In [[music]] and [[acoustics]], the term \"white noise\" may be used for any signal that has a similar hissing sound.<!-- Other uses of the term -->\n\nThe term white noise is sometimes used in the context of [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|phylogenetically based statistical methods]] to refer to a lack of phylogenetic pattern in comparative data.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Developmental trait evolution in trilobites |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue= 2|pages=314\u2013329 |year=2011 |pmid= 22276531|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01447.x|url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Fusco_et_al_2011_trilobites.pdf |last1=Fusco |first1=G|last2=Garland |first2=T., Jr |last3=Hunt |first3=G  |last4=Hughes |first4=NC}}</ref>  It is sometimes used analogously in nontechnical contexts to mean \"random talk without meaningful contents\".<ref name=shipman>\n  [[Claire Shipman]] (2005), ''[[Good Morning America]]'': \"The political [[rhetoric]] on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] is white noise.''

Even a binary signal which can only take on the values 1 or \u20131 will be white if the sequence is statistically uncorrelated. Noise having a continuous distribution, such as a [[normal distribution]], can of course be white.\n\nIt is often incorrectly assumed that [[Gaussian noise]] (i.e., noise with a Gaussian amplitude distribution{{snd}}see [[normal distribution]]) necessarily refers to white noise, yet neither property implies the other. Gaussianity refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value, in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes, while the term 'white' refers to the way the signal power is distributed (i.e., independently) over time or among frequencies.\n\nWhite noise is the generalized mean-square derivative of the [[Wiener process]] or [[Brownian motion]].\n\nA generalization to [[random element]]s on infinite dimensional spaces, such as [[random field]]s, is the [[nuclear space|white noise measure]].\n\n==Practical applications==\n\n===Music===\nWhite noise is commonly used in the production of [[electronic music]], usually either directly or as an input for a filter to create other types of noise signal. It is used extensively in [[audio synthesis]], typically to recreate percussive instruments such as [[cymbal]]s or [[snare drum]]s which have high noise content in their frequency domain. A simple example of white noise is a nonexistent radio station (static).\n\n===Electronics engineering===\nWhite noise is also used to obtain the [[impulse response]] of an electrical circuit, in particular of [[amplifier]]s and other audio equipment. It is not used for testing loudspeakers as its spectrum contains too great an amount of high frequency content. [[Pink noise]], which differs from white noise in that it has equal energy in each octave, is used for testing transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones.\n\n===Computing===\nWhite noise is used as the basis of some [[hardware random number generator|random number generators]]. For example, [[Random.org]] uses a system of atmospheric antennae to generate random digit patterns from white noise.\n\n===Tinnitus treatment===\nWhite noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a [[tinnitus masker]].<ref>{{ cite book|last=Jastreboff |first= P.

Fessler (1998), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218214647if_/http://andywilliamson.org/_/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/White-Noise.pdf On Transformations of Random Vectors.]'' Technical report 314, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Univ. of Michigan. ([[PDF]])</ref>\n\nA necessary (but, [[normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent|in general, not sufficient]]) condition for statistical independence of two variables is that they be [[correlation|statistically uncorrelated]]; that is, their [[covariance]] is zero. Therefore, the  [[covariance matrix]] ''R'' of the components of a white noise vector ''w'' with ''n'' elements must be an ''n'' by ''n'' [[diagonal matrix]], where each diagonal element ''R\u1d62\u1d62'' is the [[variance]] of component ''w\u1d62''; and the [[Correlation and dependence#Correlation matrices|correlation]] matrix must be the ''n'' by ''n'' identity matrix.\n\nIn particular, if in addition to being independent every variable in ''w'' also has a [[normal distribution]] with zero mean and the same variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>, ''w'' is said to be a Gaussian white noise vector. In that case, the joint distribution of ''w'' is a [[multivariate normal distribution]]; the independence between the variables then implies that the distribution has [[elliptical distribution|spherical symmetry]] in ''n''-dimensional space. Therefore, any [[orthogonal transformation]] of the vector will result in a Gaussian white random vector. In particular, under most types of [[discrete Fourier transform]], such as [[fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[discrete Hartley transform|Hartley]], the transform ''W'' of ''w'' will be a Gaussian white noise vector, too; that is, the ''n'' Fourier coefficients of ''w'' will be independent Gaussian variables with zero mean and the same variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>.\n\nThe [[power spectrum]] ''P'' of a random vector ''w'' can be defined as the expected value of the squared modulus of each coefficient of its Fourier transform ''W'', that is, ''P\u1d62'' = E(|''W\u1d62''|\u00b2). Under that definition, a Gaussian white noise vector will have a perfectly flat power spectrum, with ''P\u1d62''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''&sigma;\u00b2 for all&nbsp;''i''.\n\nIf ''w'' is a white random vector, but not a Gaussian one, its Fourier coefficients ''W\u1d62'' will not be completely independent of each other; although for large ''n'' and common probability distributions the dependencies are very subtle, and their pairwise correlations can be assumed to be zero.\n\nOften the weaker condition \"statistically uncorrelated\" is used in the definition of white noise, instead of \"statistically independent\". However some of the commonly expected properties of white noise (such as flat power spectrum) may not hold for this weaker version. Under this assumption, the stricter version can be referred to explicitly as independent white noise vector.<ref name=\"ezivot\">\n  Eric Zivot and Jiahui Wang (2006), [http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ584/notes/timeSeriesConcepts.pdf Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS]. Second Edition. ([[PDF]])\n</ref>{{rp|p.60}} Other authors use strongly white and weakly white instead.<ref name=\"diebold\">\n  [[Francis X. Diebold]] (2007), ''[https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/Teaching221/FullBook.pdf Elements of Forecasting],'' 4th edition. ([[PDF]])\n</ref>\n\nAn example of a random vector that is \"Gaussian white noise\" in the weak but not in the strong sense is ''x''=[''x''\u2081,''x''\u2082] where ''x''\u2081 is a normal random variable with zero mean, and ''x''\u2082 is equal to +''x''\u2081 or to \u2212''x''\u2081, with equal probability. These two variables are uncorrelated and individually normally distributed, but they are not jointly normally distributed and are not independent. If ''x'' is rotated by 45 degrees, its two components will still be uncorrelated, but their distribution will no longer be normal.\n\nIn some situations one may relax the definition by allowing each component of a white random vector ''w'' to have non-zero expected value <math>\\mu</math>. In [[image processing]] especially, where samples are typically restricted to positive values, one often takes <math>\\mu</math> to be one half of the maximum sample value. In that case, the Fourier coefficient ''W''\u2080 corresponding to the zero-frequency component (essentially, the average of the ''w''_i) will also have a non-zero expected value <math>\\mu\\sqrt{n}</math>; and the power spectrum ''P'' will be flat only over the non-zero frequencies.\n\n===Discrete-time white noise===\nA discrete-time [[stochastic process]] <math>W[n]</math> is a generalization of random vectors with a finite number of components to infinitely many components. A discrete-time stochastic process <math>W[n]</math> is called white noise if its mean does not depend on the time <math>n</math> and is equal to zero, i.e. <math>\\operatorname{E}[W[n]] = 0</math> and if the autocorrelation function <math>R_{W}[n] = \\operatorname{E}[W[k+n]W[k]]</math> only depends on <math>n</math> but not on <math>k</math> and has a nonzero value only for <math>n = 0</math>, i.e. <math>R_{W}[n] = \\sigma^2 \\delta [n]</math>.\n\n===Continuous-time white noise===\nIn order to define the notion of \"white noise\" in the theory of [[continuous-time]] signals, one must replace the concept of a \"random vector\" by a continuous-time random signal; that is, a random process that generates a function <math>w</math> of a real-valued parameter <math>t</math>.\n\nSuch a process is said to be white noise in the strongest sense if the value <math>w(t)</math> for any time <math>t</math> is a random variable that is statistically independent of its entire history before <math>t</math>. A weaker definition requires independence only between the values <math>w(t_1)</math> and <math>w(t_2)</math> at every pair of distinct times <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math>. An even weaker definition requires only that such pairs <math>w(t_1)</math> and <math>w(t_2)</math> be uncorrelated.<ref name=econterms>\n  [http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/whitenoise.htm ''White noise process'']. By Econterms via About.com. Accessed on 2013-02-12.\n</ref>  As in the discrete case, some authors adopt the weaker definition for \"white noise\", and use the qualifier independent to refer to either of the stronger definitions. Others use weakly white and strongly white to distinguish between them.\n\nHowever, a precise definition of these concepts is not trivial, because some quantities that are  finite sums in the finite discrete case must be replaced by integrals that may not converge. Indeed, the set of all possible instances of a signal <math>w</math> is no longer a finite-dimensional space <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, but an infinite-dimensional [[function space]]. Moreover, by any definition a white noise signal <math>w</math> would have to be essentially discontinuous at every point; therefore even the simplest operations on <math>w</math>, like integration over a finite interval, require advanced mathematical machinery.\n\nSome authors require each value <math>w(t)</math> to be a real-valued random variable with expectation <math>\\mu</math> and some finite variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>. Then the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(w(t_1)\\cdot w(t_2))</math> between the values at two times <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math> is well-defined: it is zero if the times are distinct, and <math>\\sigma^2</math> if they are equal. However, by this definition, the integral\n: <math>W_{[a,a+r]} = \\int_a^{a+r} w(t)\\, dt</math>\nover any interval with positive width <math>r</math> would be simply the width times the expectation: <math>r\\mu</math>. This property would render the concept inadequate as a model of physical \"white noise\" signals.\n\nTherefore, most authors define the signal <math>w</math> indirectly by specifying non-zero values for the integrals of <math>w(t)</math> and <math>|w(t)|^2</math> over any interval <math>[a,a+r]</math>, as a function of its width <math>r</math>. In this approach, however, the value of <math>w(t)</math> at an isolated time cannot be defined as a real-valued random variable{{Citation needed|reason=an authoritative work on white noise given one such example should be given|date=January 2017}}. Also the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(w(t_1)\\cdot w(t_2))</math> becomes infinite when <math>t_1=t_2</math>; and the [[autocorrelation]] function <math>\\mathrm{R}(t_1,t_2)</math> must be defined as <math>N \\delta(t_1-t_2)</math>, where <math>N</math> is some real constant and <math>\\delta</math> is [[Dirac delta function|Dirac's \"function\"]].\n\nIn this approach, one usually specifies that the integral <math>W_I</math> of <math>w(t)</math> over an interval <math>I=[a,b]</math> is a real random variable with normal distribution, zero mean, and variance <math>(b-a)\\sigma^2</math>; and also that the covariance <math>\\mathrm{E}(W_I\\cdot W_J)</math> of the integrals <math>W_I</math>, <math>W_J</math> is <math>r\\sigma^2</math>, where <math>r</math> is the width of the intersection <math>I\\cap J</math> of the two intervals <math>I,J</math>. This model is called a Gaussian white noise signal (or process).\n\n==Mathematical applications==\n\n===Time series analysis and regression===\nIn [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]] one often assumes that an observed series of data values is the sum of a series of values generated by a [[deterministic]] [[linear model|linear process]], depending on certain [[Dependent and independent variables|independent (explanatory) variables]], and on a series of random noise values. Then [[regression analysis]] is used to infer the parameters of the model process from the observed data, e.g. by [[ordinary least squares]], and to [[hypothesis testing|test the null hypothesis]] that each of the parameters is zero against the alternative hypothesis that it is non-zero. Hypothesis testing typically assumes that the noise values are mutually uncorrelated with zero mean and have the same Gaussian probability distribution{{snd}}in other words, that the noise is white. If there is non-zero correlation between the noise values underlying different observations then the estimated model parameters are still [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]], but estimates of their uncertainties (such as [[confidence interval]]s) will be biased (not accurate on average). This is also true if the noise is [[heteroskedasticity|heteroskedastic]]{{snd}}that is, if it has different variances for different data points.\n\nAlternatively, in the subset of regression analysis known as [[time series analysis]] there are often no explanatory variables other than the past values of the variable being modeled (the [[dependent variable]]). In this case the noise process is often modeled as a [[Moving average model|moving average]] process, in which the current value of the dependent variable depends on current and past values of a sequential white noise process.\n\n===Random vector transformations===\nThese two ideas are crucial in applications such as [[channel estimation]] and [[Mixing console#Channel equalization|channel equalization]] in [[telecommunication|communications]] and [[sound reproduction|audio]]. These concepts are also used in [[data compression]].\n\n<!-- This does not seem to be incorrect but seems to be original research, sort of. Needs to be trimmed to the bare essentials. -->\nIn particular, by a suitable linear transformation (a [[coloring transformation]]), a white random vector can be used to produce a \"non-white\" random vector (that is, a list of random variables) whose elements have a prescribed [[covariance matrix]]. Conversely, a random vector with known covariance matrix can be transformed into a white random vector by a suitable [[whitening transformation]].\n\n==Generation==\nWhite noise may be generated digitally with a [[digital signal processor]], [[microprocessor]], or [[microcontroller]]. Generating white noise typically entails feeding an appropriate stream of random numbers to a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. The quality of the white noise will depend on the quality of the algorithm used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/howtos/how-to-generate-white-gaussian-noise |title=How to Generate White Gaussian Noise |author=Matt Donadio |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colors of noise}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bochner\u2013Minlos theorem]]\n*[[Brownian noise]]\n*[[Dirac delta function]]\n*[[Electronic noise]]\n*[[Independent component analysis]]\n*[[Noise (physics)]]\n*[[Noise (video)]]\n*[[Principal components analysis]]\n*[[Sound masking]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|White noise}}\n\n{{Noise}}\n{{Stochastic processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Noise}}\n[[Category:Noise (electronics)]]\n[[Category:Statistical signal processing]]\n[[Category:Data compression]]\n", "name_user": "Adam majewski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGeneration:better link to pdf", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"}

A precursor of more sophisticated [[SUV]]s to come, it was created as a competitor to the [[Jeep]], and it initially featured a fold-down [[windshield]]. The Scout and second-generation Scout II were produced in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], as two-door trucks with a removable hard top with options of a full-length roof, half-cab [[pickup truck|pickup]], and/or soft top.\n\n== Origin ==\n[[File:61Scout.jpg|thumb|240px|The first model, a 1961 Scout 80, in pickup style with removable hard top]]\nInternational Harvester began building trucks and pickups in 1907. In 1953, it added a truck-based people carrier, the  [[International Harvester Travelall|Travelall]].  In the late 1950s, it began to design a competitor for the two-door [[Jeep CJ]] 4x4. The 1961 [[model year]] Scout 80 made its debut in late 1960.\n\nLater, chief designer Ted Ornas recalled:\n<blockquote>...the market potential for a [[four-wheel drive]] recreational vehicle was an unknown quantity in the early 1950s. The only such vehicle offered in the post-war period was the [[Willys]] Jeep, a version of the [[Willys MB|military jeep]] produced for [[World War II]]. It was a flat-sided bare-bones product, and American military personnel learned to appreciate its ability to maneuver over rough terrain. Sales volume was very low. In early 1958, we were directed to develop a concept proposal to enter this small market of that time. So help me, Mr. Reese, manager of engineering, said 'design something to replace the horse.' There was no product definition to use as a guide. It was even proposed to use the defunct [[Henry J]] body tooling. Compound body surfaces were considered too far out for this type of vehicle. The military jeep was thought to have the correct appearance. Our design sketches with the flat-side, no-contour look never excited the executive committee. The program began to die. One night while sitting at our kitchen table (full of frustration and desperation), I dashed off this rough sketch on a piece of scrap mat board. It had contoured sides and was designed for plastic tooling. The next morning it was shown to a committee member. He reviewed it with controlled enthusiasm, but revived interest in the program. We were off and running. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] produced many plastic parts for WWII and had formed a large [[plastic]] engineering group. We entered a program with them, a scale model was vacuum formed to simulate body assembly. This model received executive approval for appearance. By July 1959, Goodyear completed their costing, and because of the high costs, the plastic program was cancelled. By this time, the contoured design met with executive approval and a decision was made to convert the body design to [[steel]]. Starting in late July 1959, a full-sized [[clay]] model was completed, and in November 1959, it was approved. Looking back, it was a remarkable program with fast-paced engineering and manufacturing developments. The total development time of 24 months was an heroic achievement considering the concept was unique and no in-house engine or manufacturing was available or even considered when the program started.\n<br />\n\"The first Scout was introduced in 1960. A concept for its replacement was initiated in 1964 and approved for production in mid-1965. The Scout II was introduced in 1971. The basic sheet metal remained unchanged until production stopped on October 21, 1980. During the 20-year period (1960\u20131980), 532,674 Scouts were produced. The Scout, introduced as a commercial utility pickup in 1960, set the stage for future four-wheel drive recreational vehicles of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.</blockquote>\n\n== Scout models and variants ==\nScout models include the:\n*Scout 80 (1960\u20131965): The original \n*Scout 800 (1966\u20131971): Same overall design as original with upgrades (electric wipers, newer engines, etc.)\n*Scout 810 (1971): Some early Scout IIs contain Scout 810 badging on the glove box.\n*Scout II (1971\u20131980): The later standard production model with a removable soft or hard top (100-in wheelbase)\n*Scout II Terra (1976\u20131980): The light pickup truck version (118-in wheelbase).\n*Scout II Traveler (1976\u20131980): This version had a removable [[fiberglass]] hardtop, and optional third row of seats (118-in wheelbase).\n*Super Scout II (1977\u20131979): This model had removable fabric doors, a rollbar, and soft top. The soft-top model was tagged the \"SSII\" by IH marketing. Eventually, the \"SS\" letters were assumed to stand for \"Super Scout\", the name this model is called today.\n\n== Scout 80 ==\n[[File:International Harvester Scout 80.jpg|thumb|240px|A 4x4 Scout 80 with removable Traveltop]]\n\nScout 80s were built between 1960 and 1965. These models were identifiable by removable sliding side windows in 1960\u20131961 and even some very early 1962 models, a fold-down windshield, vacuum windshield wipers mounted to the top of the windshield, and an IH logo in the center of the grille. The Scout 80 had the gasoline-powered 152 [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] as its standard engine.\n\n*Red Carpet series\nThe first special package was the \"Red Carpet\" series, celebrating the 100,000th Scout manufactured by IH, and  only 3,000 were produced. This model had a red interior with a white exterior, full-length headliner, full floor mats, and a special medallion that was silver plated affixed to the door which read \"Custom\". This Scout was  a step up from regular ones; it was marketed to attract more people, and was often advertised with women in mind. Each International dealer in the United States received one Red Carpet series Scout to be used in parades, in the showroom, and for promotional purposes.\n\n*Scout 80 Campermobile\n\nIn the early 1960s, International experimented with a camper body permanently mounted to the Scout 80. The roof was raised to nearly double the original height (to allow standing upright inside), tented sleeping bunks folded out of the sides, and the rear of the body was extended significantly. The tailgate/liftgate system was replaced with one large ambulance-style swinging door. Plans included that the unit could be purchased as a stripped-down shell ($960 installed), or as a \"deluxe\" unit, which included a dinette set, stand-up galley, and a screened chemical toilet that retracted into the wall ($1850 installed). The May 1963 issue of ''Mechanix Illustrated'' contains a full-color advertisement for the Scout Camper on the inside cover, which features two artist's renderings of the unit and a form to fill out and send in for free literature. The camper showed up again in the May 1963 issue of ''Popular Science,'' this time in an actual photo as part of a two-page article about pickup campers. Production of these units was low due to limited orders, and they are rare today.\n\n== Scout 800 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800\n|image=66 Scout 800.jpg\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= 1965\u20131968\n|layout=\n|engine={{convert|152|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ''Comanche'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>{{convert|196|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>{{convert|266|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|predecessor=International Scout 80\n|successor=International Scout 800A\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n}}\n\nThe Scout 800 replaced the Scout 80 in 1965. The new 800 model was built from 1965 to 1968. These models had many improvements in comfort and design, including [[bucket seat]]s, better instrumentation and heating systems, updated dashboard, optional rear seats, and optional 196 [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] (from 1966), or 232 [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]]. Beginning in March 1967, a 266&nbsp;ci [[V8 engine]] was also offered. Externally, changes were limited to an anodized aluminum grille with a rectangular \"International\" logo paced on the grille, the IH badge was moved to the hood, the door handles became the button type, and the tailgate no longer included the \"hooks\".<ref name=\"IH366\">[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 366</ref> The base engine was a naturally aspirated \"Comanche\" 152 four-cylinder with {{convert|93|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, of which a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version with {{convert|111|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (the 152-T) was also offered. In August 1966, the turbo version was complemented by the bigger 196 which used less fuel with exactly the same power. The 196 motor achieved 20 mpg.<ref name=\"IH379\">[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 379</ref> The turbo version was dropped in early 1968. The fold-down windshield was still available, code 16536, but few were ordered because this was not advertised.  The vacuum-powered wipers were moved to the bottom of the windshield frame with the fixed windshield.\n\n[[File:IHC-Scout-2.jpg|thumb|left|1966\u20131968 Scout 800 Sportop convertible]]\nBeginning in early 1966, IH also offered the Scout 800 Sportop, which had an upgraded interior and a unique fiberglass top (also available as a convertible) with a slanted rear roof and a continental spare tire kit.<ref name=\"IH379\"/> The \"Champagne Series\" Scout was an upscale model offered in the Scout 80 and later Scout 800 models that featured a headliner, door panels, and carpet.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Scout 800A ==\n[[File:'69 scout unrestored.JPG|thumb|left|Unrestored 1969 800A Scout]]\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800A\n|image=\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= November 1968 \u2013 1970\n|layout=\n|engine={{convert|152|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ''Comanche'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>{{convert|196|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>{{convert|266|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|predecessor=International Scout 800\n|successor=International Scout 800B\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n|related=[[International Harvester Light Line pickup|1000 D-Series pickup]]\n}}\n\nNovember 1968 had the introduction of the 800A, which replaced the 800. Improvements included more creature-comfort options, a slightly different front-end treatment, drivetrain upgrades (heavier rear axle and quieter [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20 transfer case), and the options of a 196 four-cylinder, 232 six-cylinder, 266 V8, or 304 V8. The inline-six was only offered for a short period in early 1969.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 401</ref> The 800A's grille was in three segments: the center grill and two matte-black headlight bezels. The [[International Harvester Light Line pickup|Light Line]] of pickup trucks received bodywork similar to that of the Scout in late 1969.\n\nThe 800A could still be ordered with the Sportop (a slanted sporty top made of canvas or fiberglass), and later in Aristocrat and SR-2 packages. The Aristocrat was the final version of the original-bodied Scout. These trucks had a blue, vinyl interior, were painted blue and silver, and had a chrome roof rack; four-wheel drive was standard on most models.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Scout 800B ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800B\n|image=\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= August 1970 - March 1971\n|layout=\n|predecessor=International Scout 800A\n|successor=International Scout II\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n}}\n\nThe last of the 800 series was the 800B, available for less than eight months, from August 1970 until March 1971, before it was replaced with the Scout II. Other than minor cosmetic details (primarily chrome headlight bezels instead of matte black), it was identical to the 800A. It was only produced until the Scout II was in production.\n\nThe 800B was available with the Comanche package. This package included special paint and decals, chrome trim, sliding travel-top windows, and other \"high dollar\" options such as roof racks, chrome wheels, and upgraded interiors. Line tickets of the special-package Scouts (and some nonpackage units) were stamped. After the factory assembles the vehicle and the vehicle is shipped and sold, the line ticket identifies such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment, specific to that vehicle. This was, and still is, a very valuable tool when ordering parts later at the dealership by the customer. A variety of parts was used on these vehicles, so the expression \"no two are quite the same\" is not that far off.  Late in 1970, the Sno-Star package appeared (only with the six-cylinder engine), developed especially for snow-plow usage.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 420</ref>\n\n== Scout II ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout II\n|image=Ih scoutii 1979.JPG\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= April 1971 \u2013 1980\n|layout=\n|engine= ''[[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|AMC 6-232]]'' <br> ''[[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 6-258]]'' <br> ''[[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC \"V400\"]]'' \n|transmission= 3-speed ''[[TorqueFlite#A727|A727]]'' automatic\n|predecessor=International Scout 800B\n|successor=\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n|related=\n|\n}}\n[[File:1976-80 IH Scout II Traveller front.jpg|left|thumb|A 1976\u20131980 Scout II Traveler]]\nScout IIs were manufactured from April 1971 to 1980. The design was frozen much earlier, with a version nearly identical to the production model shown to management in December 1967.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 399</ref>\n\nThe Scout II is most identifiable by its different front grilles. The 1971\u20131972 Scout IIs shared the same grille, three horizontal bars between the headlights and chrome rings around the headlights. The 1973 Scout IIs had 14 vertical bars between the headlights, a split in the middle, seven bars on each side surrounded by chrome trim pieces and an \"International\" model plate low on the left side. The 1974\u201375 Scout II grilles were the same as 1973, with the addition of a vertical bar trim overlay. The 1975 had chrome and black, square trim rings around the headlights; 1976 had the same headlight trim rings as 1975, and a chrome center grille of 15 horizontal bars split into three sections was used in this year only. The 1977\u201379 Scout IIs used the same grille between the same headlight bezels the new chrome grille had two large horizontal bars with three vertical support lines and the \"International\" nameplate moved up to the center of the grille on the left side. \n\nIn 1980, the final year of production for the Scout, the grille was a very distinctive design, available with black or silver, a one-piece grille with square headlights, made of [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic. Both grille color options had imprinted chrome trim around the headlights and an \"International\" name located on the left side.\nStarting with late 1974 Scout IIs, disc and power brakes were standard features. Early 1974 models had disc brakes as a rarely selected option.  A three-speed A727 automatic made by Chrysler was optional.\n\n===Scout II Terra and Traveler===\n[[File:1976-80 IH Scout II Traveller rear.jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of a 1976-80 IH Scout II Traveler]]\nThe Terra and Traveler were produced from 1976 to 1980. Terras and Travelers had fiberglass tops; half top for the Terra or full top with hatchback-type liftgate on the Traveler. Most notably different, these models were extended by {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}  in the region between the door and the front of the rear wheel well.\n\n===Scout SSII (Softop Safari II)===\n[[File:Scout-SSII-big.png|right|thumb|IH Scout II, with SSII doors]]\nThe SSII (Super Scout II) was a stripped-down, off-road version introduced in February 1977.<ref name=CT77>{{cite journal | journal = Chicago Tribune | title = I-H offers off-road Scout | date = 1977-02-20 | page = W_B29 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/613803242.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Feb+20%2C+1977&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(1963-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=W_B29&desc=I-H+offers+off-road+Scout }}</ref> It was intended to compete directly with the Jeep CJ, and was built until 1979. This model included a soft top with soft doors, Jeep-style mirrors, plastic door inserts, special plastic grille, and a roll bar, among other options. Several SSIIs were champions on the off-road racing circuit during the late 1970s.\n\n==Special packages offered on the Scout II==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Shawnee Scout ===\nThe Shawnee Scout was to be a trim type and special-feature package model produced by [[Hurst Performance]]. This model was built by dressing up a black SSII with special [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and feather decals, special seats, a black targa-style top, hard tonneau bed cover, and of course a Hurst shifter. Only three Shawnee Scouts were produced.\n\n=== CVI: Custom Vehicles Incorporated ===\nCVI: Custom Vehicles Incorporated (also associated with Good Times, Inc.) was a company located around the corner from the Ft. Wayne Scout Assembly Plant (Good Times was located in Arlington, Texas) that produced special models for IH dealers in 1979 and 1980. The special models were dressed-up Scouts with unique exterior decals and trim, center console coolers, and hood scoops.  Some editions had plastic window louvers on the rear side glass, fender flares, and two different plastic tailgate inserts. Model names included the Midnitestar, Terrastar, Travelstar, Shadow, Raven, two Classic models, GMS (Green Machine Sport), GMS (Gold Medallion Scout), Hot Stuff, Trailstar, Sportstar, 5.6-Liter, and 3.2-Liter models.\n\n=== The \"Selective Edition\" Scout II ===\nThis was a special package available from the factory. The 1978\u201379 package order code on the line ticket was 10992. The package included special gold accent stripes, gold-spoke wheels with Goodyear Tracker A-Ts, SSII black grille insert, and Sport Steering wheel. Other options available: Choice of powertrain, seats, interior, radios, cruise control, tow packages, air conditioning, all available in exterior colors 1032 Dark Brown, 6027 Dark Blue, 001 Black, or 5013 Green. This was available on the Travel Top, Traveler, and Terra models.\n\n=== \"Spirit of 76\" and the \"Patriot\" special editions ===\nFor the US [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] in 1976, IH produced the Spirit of 76 and the Patriot models. The Spirit of 76 had a special blue soft top and blue/red side applique, and was only available on the Scout II. The Spirit also had blue interior, racing-type steering wheel, and 15x7-inch [[Chrome plating|chrome]] [[rallying|rally]] wheels. IH data only show 384 Spirit models ever being built. [[#Lineticket|Line ticket]] codes included: \n \n10876 for the side applique \n18696 to omit the hard top \n16928 deluxe interior \n16872 blue interior color \n9219 winter white exterior paint\n885102 10-15 front tires \n925102 10-15 rear tires with spare \n29091 7-in chrome wheels\n\nThe Patriot had a hard top and the same blue/red side applique, but was available in a Scout II, Terra, or Traveler. Sales figures on the Patriot only show one Terra, seven Travelers, and 50+ Scout IIs were manufactured. However, another undetermined number of Patriots were built without line ticket code designations (the applique was applied at the Truck Sales Processing Center), making how many were actually built difficult to determine. Nevertheless, both models can be considered extremely rare.\n\n=== The \"Midas Edition\" Scout II ===\nFrom 1977 to 1980, IH contracted with Midas Van Conversion Co. of [[Elkhart, Indiana]], to build special luxury models to be offered through its dealers. These vehicles had [[Swivel seat|swivel]] [[bucket seat]]s, [[shag (fabric)|shag]] carpet, color-keyed interiors, door panels, headliner, grille guards, dual sunroofs, overhead clocks, third seats, reading lights, tinted windows, fender flares, and special side appliques and paint designs. Models included the Family Cruiser (or just Cruiser), the Street Machine, and Off-Road Vehicle. Another company called Van American ([[Goshen, Indiana]]) offered similar options to compete with Midas; however, these vehicles were only offered for a short time, making them very rare today. \n[http://www.maroon.com/~byron/Scouts.html See one here.]\n\n=== Final \"Special\" version ===\nProbably one the rarest models ever produced by IH was the 1980 RS: the Special Limited Edition RS Scout. This package was only available on the Traveler in Tahitian Red (metallic). It had special extras inside and out, including polycast wheels with Tahitian Red (metallic) accent, luxurious plush all-velour russet interior including headliner and visors, special pin striping, wood-grain trim instrument panel and shift console, chrome bumpers, tinted glass, and more. Two other special packages offered in 1980 were the 844 and 434 Gold Star models. The 844 offered standard equipment plus a 345 V-8, HD clutch, T428 four-speed [[manual transmission]], 2.72 rear axle ratio, [[AM radio]], rear seat, [[hub cap]]s, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet, while the 434 offered standard equipment plus 4-196 engine, T332 three-speed transmission, 3:73 rear axle ratio, black [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] interior, AM radio, rear seat, hub caps, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet.\n\nThe last International Scout rolled off the assembly line on October 21st 1980.\n\n==Monteverdi Safari==\n{{main|Monteverdi Safari}}\n[[File:Monteverdi Safari in Lenzerheide 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Monteverdi Safari]] 1978]]\n\nThe [[Monteverdi Safari]] was made by [[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]], the Swiss brand of luxury cars, who used Scout IIs to produce well-equipped luxurious off-road station wagons. Two models were made in the late 1970s, the Safari, which had most of the bodywork changed, and the Sahara, which featured more limited changes, i.e. changed grill and a more luxurious interior. Both were available with IH's SV-345 engine or Chrysler's [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA 318]] (5.7 or 5.2 l). The Safari was also offered with Chrysler's 7.2 l \"440 RB\" engine, while the lesser Sahara could be had with the [[Nissan SD engine#SD33|Nissan SD33]] diesel engine.<ref name=\"WC81\">{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1981 | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | editor-last = L\u00f6sch | editor-first = Annamaria | location = Pelham, NY | pages = 233\u2013234 | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-910714-13-4 }}</ref>\n\n== Engines ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nEngine produced by International Harvester:\n*IH 4-152** (See note below on this engine)\n*IH 4-196** (See note below on this engine)\n*IH V-266\n*IH V-304 (This is not the same engine as the [[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC 304 V8]])\n*IH V-345\n*IH V-392 (Based on the same block as the 345)\n\nBuilt by [[American Motors Corporation]]\n* [[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|AMC 6-232]]\n* [[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 6-258]]\n* [[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC \"V400\"]] (some 73/74 pickups and Travelalls had this, the AMC 401, installed as a shortage of the V-392 engines existed.\nTo tell the AMC engine from IH's own V8s, look at the thermostat housing. AMC is round. IH is rectangular. Other differences occur, but this is the quickest method.\n\nBuilt by [[Nissan]] \n*[[Nissan]] [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|SD33]] ([[Diesel engine|diesel]]) (naturally aspirated)\n*[[Nissan]] [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|SD33T]] ([[turbodiesel]]\u20141980 only)\n\nInternational offered the Scout with a variety of engines over its years of production. The Scout 80 (1961\u20131965) had the gasoline-powered 152 four-cylinder as its standard engine. From 1965 to 1971 (Models 800, 800A, and 800B), engine options were the gasoline-powered 196 four-cylinder, AMC 232 six-cylinder, 266 V-8, and the 304 V-8. A turbocharged version of the 152 four-cylinder engine was offered from 1965 to 1967.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nA few early Scouts are rumored to have left the factory with [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] diesel engines, but these would have been special-order trucks and not a standard option. The Scout II (made between 1971 and 1980) had the following engine options: the 196 4-cylinder, 232 6-cylinder (early production), 258 6-cylinder (later production), 304 V-8, and 345 V-8. At the time, International did not manufacture a diesel engine small enough to be used in the Scout, and so starting in 1976 used the [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|Nissan SD33]] diesel engine as an option. This engine was replaced by the SD33T] turbodiesel engine in 1980.\n\n==Axles and gear ratios==\n[[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 27 axles were used for the front and rear wheels in the 80 and 800 models until around 1968. Both front and rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]s were offset to the passenger side for the purpose of lining up the [[driveshaft]]s with the Dana 18 [[transfer case]]. With the transition to the 800A model, the rear axle was upgraded to a [[Dana 44]], with a centered differential mated to the Dana 20 transfer case (which had replaced the Dana 18). Some Scouts from this transitional time are a mix of old and new designs, with the rear driveshaft running at an angle. The front axle was still a Dana 27 model, though if the buyer ordered the 3500-lb axle option, the front axle was upgraded to a hybrid unit built from a Dana 30 center section and 27 tubes. The V8 engine option included an automatic upgrade to the heavier-duty Dana 30 axle. The rear axle shafts changed from two pieces to one piece around 1968 or 1969. A [[Powr-Lok]] limited-slip differential was provided as an option for both front and rear axles. Common gear ratios are 3.31, 3.73, or 4.27, though nearly any ratio was available by special order (in at least one instance, a Scout 800 was shipped with a 5.71).\n\nIn Scout IIs, Dana 30 front axles and Dana 44 rear axles were standard until 1974, with front Dana 44 axles as a special order. After 1974, Dana 44 front and rear axles became standard on all Scout IIs. Available gear ratios were 2.72, 3.07, 3.31, 3.54, 3.73, 4.09, 4.27, and 4.54. [[Trak-Lok]] limited-slip differentials were optional.\n\nAxles originally had a tag bolted to their differential cover stamped with their gear ratio, but this tag often rusted off over time or was intentionally removed. The [[International Harvester Scout#Line Setting Ticket|line ticket]] can be checked to identify the axle model, gear ratio, and whether it is equipped with a traction device, using an International parts code book.\n\n== Use in off-road racing ==\nScout SSIIs took top honors in off-road racing during the late 1970s. In 1977, [[Jerry Boone]], of [[Parker, Arizona]], finished first among 4x4 production vehicles in the [[Baja 1000]]. Boone completed the run in 19 hours 58 minutes, crossing the finish line at [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] almost 2 hours ahead of  his closest competitor: a [[Jeep CJ7]]. Only 9 of 21 vehicles that started the race finished the {{convert|1000|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=on}} course. Boone ran even faster than [[Class IV modified 4x4]] racers. Mr. Boone later revealed that they only had a month to prep a stock SSII for the race and they were not sponsored by IH until after the race.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Boone also won in 1978 at [[Riverside, California]].\n\n[[Sherman Balch]], among many other accomplishments in off-road racing, won the off-road \"world championship\" in 1977 (the [[SCORE International|SCORE]] event in Riverside, California). Three other finishers along with Balch also drove Scouts. Balch also won the Baja 1000, the [[Mint 400]], and three events in the fall of 1978 at [[Lake Geneva Raceway]].\n\nSherman Balch and co-driver James Acker, driving a Scout SSII, went on to win virtually all major off-road races in 1982 offered on the West Coast/Mexico circuit by winning the Baja 250, the [[Baja 500]], the Baja 1000, the Mint 400, and the Parker (Arizona) 400.\n\n== Line ticket ==\nWhen an IH vehicle was ordered, a factory build or construction sheet was created (when the order was sent to the factory) with the new vehicle's [[VIN]] or ID number, and all the codes for standard equipment and options that the salesman used to create this vehicle for his customer or inventory. This sheet was used to assemble the vehicle from beginning to finish. After the factory assembled the vehicle and the vehicle was shipped and sold, the line [setting] ticket identified such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment specific to that vehicle. Different parts used on the same model in the same year. A very small copy of the line ticket was attached to each vehicle during the building process at the factory. The location of the ticket varied: 1971\u20131976 Scout IIs had their copies mounted under their hoods, attached to the cowl cover panels. The 1977\u20131980 Scout IIs had their copies on the inside of the glove box doors, and 1969\u20131975 pickups and Travelalls had them attached to the back of the glove boxes; depressing the keeper tabs on each side of the box lets the box swing down to reveal the ticket. If lost, line tickets can be ordered through several Scout parts specialists, due to their diligence in maintaining these valuable resources.\n\n== Scout III SSV concept vehicle ==\nIH developed a concept prototype for the next version of the Scout in 1979 called the Scout III SSV, but due to the company's decision to discontinue the Scout product line, it was never put into production. The second prototype of the concept vehicle is on display at the [[Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum]] in [[Auburn, Indiana]]. It was a two-door with a sloped back window, built on a 100-in chassis with 162-hp V8.\n\nMany people call this THE 1981 Scout. The SSV meant Scout Supplemental Vehicle, meant to be a limited production supplement to the regular model to help promote it, much as the Corvette supplements the Chevrolet line. While the SSV may have appeared in 1981 if it had reached production, designs existed for a new model in 1981 to replace the Scout II. Clay models of this showed an evolution of the Scout II into a more rounded body somewhat resembling the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]]. The demise of the Scout line killed the SSV; the company continues to this day, having changed its name to [[Navistar]] in 1985 after selling off the farm machinery business along with the International Harvester name.\n<ref>http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2008/11/17/international-history-in-auburn-museum/</ref>\n\n== Case IH Scout ==\nIn 2010, Case IH started production of a [[Side by Side (UTV)|UTV]] side by side utility ATV called the Scout and Scout XL, also sold as New Holland Rustler. These UTVs were built by [[Club Car]].<ref>http://www.agcanada.com/grainews/2009/11/09/cnh-adds-utility-vehicles/</ref>\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | ref = Crismon | last = Crismon | first = Frederick W. | title = International Trucks | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Victory WW2 Publishing | location = Minneapolis, MN | isbn = 0-9700567-2-9 }}\n{{reflist}}\nhttp://www.superscoutspecialists.com/store/t-faq.aspx\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/International-Scout-Encyclopedia-Authoritative-Legendary/dp/1937747514/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1PQDC8CT1C3S8950XWQX|last=Allen |first=Jim|last2=Glancy|first2=John|title=International Scout Encyclopedia: The Authoritative Guide to IH's Legendary 4x4|year=2016|publisher=Octane Press|isbn=9781937747510 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}\n*Banks, Michael.

A precursor of more sophisticated [[SUV]]s to come, it was created as a competitor to the [[Jeep]], and it initially featured a fold-down [[windshield]]. The Scout and second-generation Scout II were produced in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], as two-door trucks with a removable hard top with options of a full-length roof, half-cab [[pickup truck|pickup]], and/or soft top.\n\n== Origin ==\n[[File:61Scout.jpg|thumb|240px|The first model, a 1961 Scout 80, in pickup style with removable hard top]]\nInternational Harvester began building trucks and pickups in 1907. In 1953, it added a truck-based people carrier, the  [[International Harvester Travelall|Travelall]].  In the late 1950s, it began to design a competitor for the two-door [[Jeep CJ]] 4x4. The 1961 [[model year]] Scout 80 made its debut in late 1960.\n\nLater, chief designer Ted Ornas recalled:\n<blockquote>...the market potential for a [[four-wheel drive]] recreational vehicle was an unknown quantity in the early 1950s. The only such vehicle offered in the post-war period was the [[Willys]] Jeep, a version of the [[Willys MB|military jeep]] produced for [[World War II]]. It was a flat-sided bare-bones product, and American military personnel learned to appreciate its ability to maneuver over rough terrain. Sales volume was very low. In early 1958, we were directed to develop a concept proposal to enter this small market of that time. So help me, Mr. Reese, manager of engineering, said 'design something to replace the horse.' There was no product definition to use as a guide. It was even proposed to use the defunct [[Henry J]] body tooling. Compound body surfaces were considered too far out for this type of vehicle. The military jeep was thought to have the correct appearance. Our design sketches with the flat-side, no-contour look never excited the executive committee. The program began to die. One night while sitting at our kitchen table (full of frustration and desperation), I dashed off this rough sketch on a piece of scrap mat board. It had contoured sides and was designed for plastic tooling. The next morning it was shown to a committee member. He reviewed it with controlled enthusiasm, but revived interest in the program. We were off and running. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] produced many plastic parts for WWII and had formed a large [[plastic]] engineering group. We entered a program with them, a scale model was vacuum formed to simulate body assembly. This model received executive approval for appearance. By July 1959, Goodyear completed their costing, and because of the high costs, the plastic program was cancelled. By this time, the contoured design met with executive approval and a decision was made to convert the body design to [[steel]]. Starting in late July 1959, a full-sized [[clay]] model was completed, and in November 1959, it was approved. Looking back, it was a remarkable program with fast-paced engineering and manufacturing developments. The total development time of 24 months was an heroic achievement considering the concept was unique and no in-house engine or manufacturing was available or even considered when the program started.\n<br />\n\"The first Scout was introduced in 1960. A concept for its replacement was initiated in 1964 and approved for production in mid-1965. The Scout II was introduced in 1971. The basic sheet metal remained unchanged until production stopped on October 21, 1980. During the 20-year period (1960\u20131980), 532,674 Scouts were produced. The Scout, introduced as a commercial utility pickup in 1960, set the stage for future four-wheel drive recreational vehicles of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.</blockquote>\n\n== Scout models and variants ==\nScout models include the:\n*Scout 80 (1960\u20131965): The original \n*Scout 800 (1966\u20131971): Same overall design as original with upgrades (electric wipers, newer engines, etc.)\n*Scout 810 (1971): Some early Scout IIs contain Scout 810 badging on the glove box.\n*Scout II (1971\u20131980): The later standard production model with a removable soft or hard top (100-in wheelbase)\n*Scout II Terra (1976\u20131980): The light pickup truck version (118-in wheelbase).\n*Scout II Traveler (1976\u20131980): This version had a removable [[fiberglass]] hardtop, and optional third row of seats (118-in wheelbase).\n*Super Scout II (1977\u20131979): This model had removable fabric doors, a rollbar, and soft top. The soft-top model was tagged the \"SSII\" by IH marketing. Eventually, the \"SS\" letters were assumed to stand for \"Super Scout\", the name this model is called today.\n\n== Scout 80 ==\n[[File:International Harvester Scout 80.jpg|thumb|240px|A 4x4 Scout 80 with removable Traveltop]]\n\nScout 80s were built between 1960 and 1965. These models were identifiable by removable sliding side windows in 1960\u20131961 and even some very early 1962 models, a fold-down windshield, vacuum windshield wipers mounted to the top of the windshield, and an IH logo in the center of the grille. The Scout 80 had the gasoline-powered 152 [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] as its standard engine.\n\n*Red Carpet series\nThe first special package was the \"Red Carpet\" series, celebrating the 100,000th Scout manufactured by IH, and  only 3,000 were produced. This model had a red interior with a white exterior, full-length headliner, full floor mats, and a special medallion that was silver plated affixed to the door which read \"Custom\". This Scout was  a step up from regular ones; it was marketed to attract more people, and was often advertised with women in mind. Each International dealer in the United States received one Red Carpet series Scout to be used in parades, in the showroom, and for promotional purposes.\n\n*Scout 80 Campermobile\n\nIn the early 1960s, International experimented with a camper body permanently mounted to the Scout 80. The roof was raised to nearly double the original height (to allow standing upright inside), tented sleeping bunks folded out of the sides, and the rear of the body was extended significantly. The tailgate/liftgate system was replaced with one large ambulance-style swinging door. Plans included that the unit could be purchased as a stripped-down shell ($960 installed), or as a \"deluxe\" unit, which included a dinette set, stand-up galley, and a screened chemical toilet that retracted into the wall ($1850 installed). The May 1963 issue of ''Mechanix Illustrated'' contains a full-color advertisement for the Scout Camper on the inside cover, which features two artist's renderings of the unit and a form to fill out and send in for free literature. The camper showed up again in the May 1963 issue of ''Popular Science,'' this time in an actual photo as part of a two-page article about pickup campers. Production of these units was low due to limited orders, and they are rare today.\n\n== Scout 800 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800\n|image=66 Scout 800.jpg\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= 1965\u20131968\n|layout=\n|engine={{convert|152|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ''Comanche'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>{{convert|196|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>{{convert|266|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|predecessor=International Scout 80\n|successor=International Scout 800A\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n}}\n\nThe Scout 800 replaced the Scout 80 in 1965. The new 800 model was built from 1965 to 1968. These models had many improvements in comfort and design, including [[bucket seat]]s, better instrumentation and heating systems, updated dashboard, optional rear seats, and optional 196 [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] (from 1966), or 232 [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]]. Beginning in March 1967, a 266&nbsp;ci [[V8 engine]] was also offered. Externally, changes were limited to an anodized aluminum grille with a rectangular \"International\" logo paced on the grille, the IH badge was moved to the hood, the door handles became the button type, and the tailgate no longer included the \"hooks\".<ref name=\"IH366\">[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 366</ref> The base engine was a naturally aspirated \"Comanche\" 152 four-cylinder with {{convert|93|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, of which a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version with {{convert|111|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (the 152-T) was also offered. In August 1966, the turbo version was complemented by the bigger 196 which used less fuel with exactly the same power. The 196 motor achieved 20 mpg.<ref name=\"IH379\">[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 379</ref> The turbo version was dropped in early 1968. The fold-down windshield was still available, code 16536, but few were ordered because this was not advertised.  The vacuum-powered wipers were moved to the bottom of the windshield frame with the fixed windshield.\n\n[[File:IHC-Scout-2.jpg|thumb|left|1966\u20131968 Scout 800 Sportop convertible]]\nBeginning in early 1966, IH also offered the Scout 800 Sportop, which had an upgraded interior and a unique fiberglass top (also available as a convertible) with a slanted rear roof and a continental spare tire kit.<ref name=\"IH379\"/> The \"Champagne Series\" Scout was an upscale model offered in the Scout 80 and later Scout 800 models that featured a headliner, door panels, and carpet.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Scout 800A ==\n[[File:'69 scout unrestored.JPG|thumb|left|Unrestored 1969 800A Scout]]\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800A\n|image=\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= November 1968 \u2013 1970\n|layout=\n|engine={{convert|152|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ''Comanche'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>{{convert|196|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>{{convert|266|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|predecessor=International Scout 800\n|successor=International Scout 800B\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n|related=[[International Harvester Light Line pickup|1000 D-Series pickup]]\n}}\n\nNovember 1968 had the introduction of the 800A, which replaced the 800. Improvements included more creature-comfort options, a slightly different front-end treatment, drivetrain upgrades (heavier rear axle and quieter [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20 transfer case), and the options of a 196 four-cylinder, 232 six-cylinder, 266 V8, or 304 V8. The inline-six was only offered for a short period in early 1969.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 401</ref> The 800A's grille was in three segments: the center grill and two matte-black headlight bezels. The [[International Harvester Light Line pickup|Light Line]] of pickup trucks received bodywork similar to that of the Scout in late 1969.\n\nThe 800A could still be ordered with the Sportop (a slanted sporty top made of canvas or fiberglass), and later in Aristocrat and SR-2 packages. The Aristocrat was the final version of the original-bodied Scout. These trucks had a blue, vinyl interior, were painted blue and silver, and had a chrome roof rack; four-wheel drive was standard on most models.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Scout 800B ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout 800B\n|image=\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= August 1970 - March 1971\n|layout=\n|predecessor=International Scout 800A\n|successor=International Scout II\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n}}\n\nThe last of the 800 series was the 800B, available for less than eight months, from August 1970 until March 1971, before it was replaced with the Scout II. Other than minor cosmetic details (primarily chrome headlight bezels instead of matte black), it was identical to the 800A. It was only produced until the Scout II was in production.\n\nThe 800B was available with the Comanche package. This package included special paint and decals, chrome trim, sliding travel-top windows, and other \"high dollar\" options such as roof racks, chrome wheels, and upgraded interiors. Line tickets of the special-package Scouts (and some nonpackage units) were stamped. After the factory assembles the vehicle and the vehicle is shipped and sold, the line ticket identifies such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment, specific to that vehicle. This was, and still is, a very valuable tool when ordering parts later at the dealership by the customer. A variety of parts was used on these vehicles, so the expression \"no two are quite the same\" is not that far off.  Late in 1970, the Sno-Star package appeared (only with the six-cylinder engine), developed especially for snow-plow usage.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 420</ref>\n\n== Scout II ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=International Scout II\n|image=Ih scoutii 1979.JPG\n|manufacturer=[[International Harvester]]\n|production= April 1971 \u2013 1980\n|layout=\n|engine= ''[[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|AMC 6-232]]'' <br> ''[[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 6-258]]'' <br> ''[[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC \"V400\"]]'' \n|transmission= 3-speed ''[[TorqueFlite#A727|A727]]'' automatic\n|predecessor=International Scout 800B\n|successor=\n|class=\n|wheelbase=\n|assembly=\n|related=\n|\n}}\n[[File:1976-80 IH Scout II Traveller front.jpg|left|thumb|A 1976\u20131980 Scout II Traveler]]\nScout IIs were manufactured from April 1971 to 1980. The design was frozen much earlier, with a version nearly identical to the production model shown to management in December 1967.<ref>[[#Crismon|Crismon]], p. 399</ref>\n\nThe Scout II is most identifiable by its different front grilles. The 1971\u20131972 Scout IIs shared the same grille, three horizontal bars between the headlights and chrome rings around the headlights. The 1973 Scout IIs had 14 vertical bars between the headlights, a split in the middle, seven bars on each side surrounded by chrome trim pieces and an \"International\" model plate low on the left side. The 1974\u201375 Scout II grilles were the same as 1973, with the addition of a vertical bar trim overlay. The 1975 had chrome and black, square trim rings around the headlights; 1976 had the same headlight trim rings as 1975, and a chrome center grille of 15 horizontal bars split into three sections was used in this year only. The 1977\u201379 Scout IIs used the same grille between the same headlight bezels the new chrome grille had two large horizontal bars with three vertical support lines and the \"International\" nameplate moved up to the center of the grille on the left side. \n\nIn 1980, the final year of production for the Scout, the grille was a very distinctive design, available with black or silver, a one-piece grille with square headlights, made of [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic. Both grille color options had imprinted chrome trim around the headlights and an \"International\" name located on the left side.\nStarting with late 1974 Scout IIs, disc and power brakes were standard features. Early 1974 models had disc brakes as a rarely selected option.  A three-speed A727 automatic made by Chrysler was optional.\n\n===Scout II Terra and Traveler===\n[[File:1976-80 IH Scout II Traveller rear.jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of a 1976-80 IH Scout II Traveler]]\nThe Terra and Traveler were produced from 1976 to 1980. Terras and Travelers had fiberglass tops; half top for the Terra or full top with hatchback-type liftgate on the Traveler. Most notably different, these models were extended by {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}  in the region between the door and the front of the rear wheel well.\n\n===Scout SSII (Softop Safari II)===\n[[File:Scout-SSII-big.png|right|thumb|IH Scout II, with SSII doors]]\nThe SSII (Super Scout II) was a stripped-down, off-road version introduced in February 1977.<ref name=CT77>{{cite journal | journal = Chicago Tribune | title = I-H offers off-road Scout | date = 1977-02-20 | page = W_B29 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/613803242.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Feb+20%2C+1977&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(1963-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=W_B29&desc=I-H+offers+off-road+Scout }}</ref> It was intended to compete directly with the Jeep CJ, and was built until 1979. This model included a soft top with soft doors, Jeep-style mirrors, plastic door inserts, special plastic grille, and a roll bar, among other options. Several SSIIs were champions on the off-road racing circuit during the late 1970s.\n\n==Special packages offered on the Scout II==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Shawnee Scout ===\nThe Shawnee Scout was to be a trim type and special-feature package model produced by [[Hurst Performance]]. This model was built by dressing up a black SSII with special [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and feather decals, special seats, a black targa-style top, hard tonneau bed cover, and of course a Hurst shifter. Only three Shawnee Scouts were produced.\n\n=== CVI: Custom Vehicles Incorporated ===\nCVI: Custom Vehicles Incorporated (also associated with Good Times, Inc.) was a company located around the corner from the Ft. Wayne Scout Assembly Plant (Good Times was located in Arlington, Texas) that produced special models for IH dealers in 1979 and 1980. The special models were dressed-up Scouts with unique exterior decals and trim, center console coolers, and hood scoops.  Some editions had plastic window louvers on the rear side glass, fender flares, and two different plastic tailgate inserts. Model names included the Midnitestar, Terrastar, Travelstar, Shadow, Raven, two Classic models, GMS (Green Machine Sport), GMS (Gold Medallion Scout), Hot Stuff, Trailstar, Sportstar, 5.6-Liter, and 3.2-Liter models.\n\n=== The \"Selective Edition\" Scout II ===\nThis was a special package available from the factory. The 1978\u201379 package order code on the line ticket was 10992. The package included special gold accent stripes, gold-spoke wheels with Goodyear Tracker A-Ts, SSII black grille insert, and Sport Steering wheel. Other options available: Choice of powertrain, seats, interior, radios, cruise control, tow packages, air conditioning, all available in exterior colors 1032 Dark Brown, 6027 Dark Blue, 001 Black, or 5013 Green. This was available on the Travel Top, Traveler, and Terra models.\n\n=== \"Spirit of 76\" and the \"Patriot\" special editions ===\nFor the US [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] in 1976, IH produced the Spirit of 76 and the Patriot models. The Spirit of 76 had a special blue soft top and blue/red side applique, and was only available on the Scout II. The Spirit also had blue interior, racing-type steering wheel, and 15x7-inch [[Chrome plating|chrome]] [[rallying|rally]] wheels. IH data only show 384 Spirit models ever being built. [[#Lineticket|Line ticket]] codes included: \n \n10876 for the side applique \n18696 to omit the hard top \n16928 deluxe interior \n16872 blue interior color \n9219 winter white exterior paint\n885102 10-15 front tires \n925102 10-15 rear tires with spare \n29091 7-in chrome wheels\n\nThe Patriot had a hard top and the same blue/red side applique, but was available in a Scout II, Terra, or Traveler. Sales figures on the Patriot only show one Terra, seven Travelers, and 50+ Scout IIs were manufactured. However, another undetermined number of Patriots were built without line ticket code designations (the applique was applied at the Truck Sales Processing Center), making how many were actually built difficult to determine. Nevertheless, both models can be considered extremely rare.\n\n=== The \"Midas Edition\" Scout II ===\nFrom 1977 to 1980, IH contracted with Midas Van Conversion Co. of [[Elkhart, Indiana]], to build special luxury models to be offered through its dealers. These vehicles had [[Swivel seat|swivel]] [[bucket seat]]s, [[shag (fabric)|shag]] carpet, color-keyed interiors, door panels, headliner, grille guards, dual sunroofs, overhead clocks, third seats, reading lights, tinted windows, fender flares, and special side appliques and paint designs. Models included the Family Cruiser (or just Cruiser), the Street Machine, and Off-Road Vehicle. Another company called Van American ([[Goshen, Indiana]]) offered similar options to compete with Midas; however, these vehicles were only offered for a short time, making them very rare today. \n[http://www.maroon.com/~byron/Scouts.html See one here.]\n\n=== Final \"Special\" version ===\nProbably one the rarest models ever produced by IH was the 1980 RS: the Special Limited Edition RS Scout. This package was only available on the Traveler in Tahitian Red (metallic). It had special extras inside and out, including polycast wheels with Tahitian Red (metallic) accent, luxurious plush all-velour russet interior including headliner and visors, special pin striping, wood-grain trim instrument panel and shift console, chrome bumpers, tinted glass, and more. Two other special packages offered in 1980 were the 844 and 434 Gold Star models. The 844 offered standard equipment plus a 345 V-8, HD clutch, T428 four-speed [[manual transmission]], 2.72 rear axle ratio, [[AM radio]], rear seat, [[hub cap]]s, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet, while the 434 offered standard equipment plus 4-196 engine, T332 three-speed transmission, 3:73 rear axle ratio, black [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] interior, AM radio, rear seat, hub caps, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet.\n\nThe last International Scout rolled off the assembly line on October 21st 1980.\n\n==Monteverdi Safari==\n{{main|Monteverdi Safari}}\n[[File:Monteverdi Safari in Lenzerheide 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Monteverdi Safari]] 1978]]\n\nThe [[Monteverdi Safari]] was made by [[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]], the Swiss brand of luxury cars, used Scout IIs to produce well-equipped luxurious off-road station wagons. Two models were made in the late 1970s, the Safari, which had most of the bodywork changed, and the Sahara, which featured more limited changes, i.e. changed grill and a more luxurious interior. Both were available with IH's SV-345 engine or Chrysler's [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA 318]] (5.7 or 5.2 l). The Safari was also offered with Chrysler's 7.2 l \"440 RB\" engine, while the lesser Sahara could be had with the [[Nissan SD engine#SD33|Nissan SD33]] diesel engine.<ref name=\"WC81\">{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1981 | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | editor-last = L\u00f6sch | editor-first = Annamaria | location = Pelham, NY | pages = 233\u2013234 | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-910714-13-4 }}</ref>\n\n== Engines ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nEngine produced by International Harvester:\n*IH 4-152** (See note below on this engine)\n*IH 4-196** (See note below on this engine)\n*IH V-266\n*IH V-304 (This is not the same engine as the [[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC 304 V8]])\n*IH V-345\n*IH V-392 (Based on the same block as the 345)\n\nBuilt by [[American Motors Corporation]]\n* [[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|AMC 6-232]]\n* [[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 6-258]]\n* [[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC \"V400\"]] (some 73/74 pickups and Travelalls had this, the AMC 401, installed as a shortage of the V-392 engines existed.\nTo tell the AMC engine from IH's own V8s, look at the thermostat housing. AMC is round. IH is rectangular. Other differences occur, but this is the quickest method.\n\nBuilt by [[Nissan]] \n*[[Nissan]] [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|SD33]] ([[Diesel engine|diesel]]) (naturally aspirated)\n*[[Nissan]] [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|SD33T]] ([[turbodiesel]]\u20141980 only)\n\nInternational offered the Scout with a variety of engines over its years of production. The Scout 80 (1961\u20131965) had the gasoline-powered 152 four-cylinder as its standard engine. From 1965 to 1971 (Models 800, 800A, and 800B), engine options were the gasoline-powered 196 four-cylinder, AMC 232 six-cylinder, 266 V-8, and the 304 V-8. A turbocharged version of the 152 four-cylinder engine was offered from 1965 to 1967.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nA few early Scouts are rumored to have left the factory with [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] diesel engines, but these would have been special-order trucks and not a standard option. The Scout II (made between 1971 and 1980) had the following engine options: the 196 4-cylinder, 232 6-cylinder (early production), 258 6-cylinder (later production), 304 V-8, and 345 V-8. At the time, International did not manufacture a diesel engine small enough to be used in the Scout, and so starting in 1976 used the [[Nissan SD engine#Straight 6|Nissan SD33]] diesel engine as an option. This engine was replaced by the SD33T] turbodiesel engine in 1980.\n\n==Axles and gear ratios==\n[[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 27 axles were used for the front and rear wheels in the 80 and 800 models until around 1968. Both front and rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]s were offset to the passenger side for the purpose of lining up the [[driveshaft]]s with the Dana 18 [[transfer case]]. With the transition to the 800A model, the rear axle was upgraded to a [[Dana 44]], with a centered differential mated to the Dana 20 transfer case (which had replaced the Dana 18). Some Scouts from this transitional time are a mix of old and new designs, with the rear driveshaft running at an angle. The front axle was still a Dana 27 model, though if the buyer ordered the 3500-lb axle option, the front axle was upgraded to a hybrid unit built from a Dana 30 center section and 27 tubes. The V8 engine option included an automatic upgrade to the heavier-duty Dana 30 axle. The rear axle shafts changed from two pieces to one piece around 1968 or 1969. A [[Powr-Lok]] limited-slip differential was provided as an option for both front and rear axles. Common gear ratios are 3.31, 3.73, or 4.27, though nearly any ratio was available by special order (in at least one instance, a Scout 800 was shipped with a 5.71).\n\nIn Scout IIs, Dana 30 front axles and Dana 44 rear axles were standard until 1974, with front Dana 44 axles as a special order. After 1974, Dana 44 front and rear axles became standard on all Scout IIs. Available gear ratios were 2.72, 3.07, 3.31, 3.54, 3.73, 4.09, 4.27, and 4.54. [[Trak-Lok]] limited-slip differentials were optional.\n\nAxles originally had a tag bolted to their differential cover stamped with their gear ratio, but this tag often rusted off over time or was intentionally removed. The [[International Harvester Scout#Line Setting Ticket|line ticket]] can be checked to identify the axle model, gear ratio, and whether it is equipped with a traction device, using an International parts code book.\n\n== Use in off-road racing ==\nScout SSIIs took top honors in off-road racing during the late 1970s. In 1977, [[Jerry Boone]], of [[Parker, Arizona]], finished first among 4x4 production vehicles in the [[Baja 1000]]. Boone completed the run in 19 hours 58 minutes, crossing the finish line at [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] almost 2 hours ahead of  his closest competitor: a [[Jeep CJ7]]. Only 9 of 21 vehicles that started the race finished the {{convert|1000|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=on}} course. Boone ran even faster than [[Class IV modified 4x4]] racers. Mr. Boone later revealed that they only had a month to prep a stock SSII for the race and they were not sponsored by IH until after the race.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Boone also won in 1978 at [[Riverside, California]].\n\n[[Sherman Balch]], among many other accomplishments in off-road racing, won the off-road \"world championship\" in 1977 (the [[SCORE International|SCORE]] event in Riverside, California). Three other finishers along with Balch also drove Scouts. Balch also won the Baja 1000, the [[Mint 400]], and three events in the fall of 1978 at [[Lake Geneva Raceway]].\n\nSherman Balch and co-driver James Acker, driving a Scout SSII, went on to win virtually all major off-road races in 1982 offered on the West Coast/Mexico circuit by winning the Baja 250, the [[Baja 500]], the Baja 1000, the Mint 400, and the Parker (Arizona) 400.\n\n== Line ticket ==\nWhen an IH vehicle was ordered, a factory build or construction sheet was created (when the order was sent to the factory) with the new vehicle's [[VIN]] or ID number, and all the codes for standard equipment and options that the salesman used to create this vehicle for his customer or inventory. This sheet was used to assemble the vehicle from beginning to finish. After the factory assembled the vehicle and the vehicle was shipped and sold, the line [setting] ticket identified such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment specific to that vehicle. Different parts used on the same model in the same year. A very small copy of the line ticket was attached to each vehicle during the building process at the factory. The location of the ticket varied: 1971\u20131976 Scout IIs had their copies mounted under their hoods, attached to the cowl cover panels. The 1977\u20131980 Scout IIs had their copies on the inside of the glove box doors, and 1969\u20131975 pickups and Travelalls had them attached to the back of the glove boxes; depressing the keeper tabs on each side of the box lets the box swing down to reveal the ticket. If lost, line tickets can be ordered through several Scout parts specialists, due to their diligence in maintaining these valuable resources.\n\n== Scout III SSV concept vehicle ==\nIH developed a concept prototype for the next version of the Scout in 1979 called the Scout III SSV, but due to the company's decision to discontinue the Scout product line, it was never put into production. The second prototype of the concept vehicle is on display at the [[Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum]] in [[Auburn, Indiana]]. It was a two-door with a sloped back window, built on a 100-in chassis with 162-hp V8.\n\nMany people call this THE 1981 Scout. The SSV meant Scout Supplemental Vehicle, meant to be a limited production supplement to the regular model to help promote it, much as the Corvette supplements the Chevrolet line. While the SSV may have appeared in 1981 if it had reached production, designs existed for a new model in 1981 to replace the Scout II. Clay models of this showed an evolution of the Scout II into a more rounded body somewhat resembling the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]]. The demise of the Scout line killed the SSV; the company continues to this day, having changed its name to [[Navistar]] in 1985 after selling off the farm machinery business along with the International Harvester name.\n<ref>http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2008/11/17/international-history-in-auburn-museum/</ref>\n\n== Case IH Scout ==\nIn 2010, Case IH started production of a [[Side by Side (UTV)|UTV]] side by side utility ATV called the Scout and Scout XL, also sold as New Holland Rustler.
