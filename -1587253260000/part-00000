When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.

The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013. The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html|title=CNN, Fox News, MSNBC Air Name of Steubenville Rape Victim|date=March 18, 2013|last=Fung|first=Katherine|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=nyt20121217>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Rape Case Unfolds on Web and Splits City |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2012|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Macur|first2=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSteubenville is located at {{coord|40|21|30|N|80|37|0|W|type:city}} (40.359, \u221280.614).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The city lies along the [[Ohio River]], with the city spreading west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city.

The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006.

It is referred to as a \"[[base tunnel]]\" since it bypasses most of the existing [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard railway line]], a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]], which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT.

This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks, and reduces the [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]] caused by heavy trucks.

Unlike most other tunnels, the Gotthard Base Tunnel passes under several distinct mountain massifs, two of them being major subranges of the Alps, the [[Glarus Alps]] and the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]], with the valley of the [[Anterior Rhine]], the [[Surselva]] in the [[canton of Graub\u00fcnden]], between them. The tunnel passes under these two ranges more than {{convert|2|km|ft|spell=in}} below the [[Chr\u00fczlistock]] ({{convert|2709|m|abbr=on}}) and the [[Piz Vatgira]] ({{convert|2983|m|abbr=on}}, near the [[Lukmanier Pass]]).

There, the tunnel penetrates the western slopes of the [[B\u00e4lmeten]] and [[Chli Windg\u00e4llen]] (although only marginally) before passing below the valley of the Ch\u00e4rstelenbach, a creek in the [[Maderanertal]]. From there, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of Etzli, below the [[Witenalpstock]]. The main crest of the Glarus Alps, which is the watershed between the Reuss and the Anterior Rhine, is crossed below the [[Chr\u00fczlistock]], the crest having an elevation of about {{convert|2700|m}} at this point. From the crest and border, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of the river Strem (Val Strem) before passing below [[Sedrun]] and the Anterior Rhine. From the bottom of the valley, the tunnel proceeds towards the valley of the Rein da Nalps (Val Nalps) and passes east of [[Lai da Nalps]], before crossing the Gannaretsch range below the western summit of [[Piz Vatgira]] ({{convert|2981|m}}). This is the deepest point of the tunnel, with a rock layer of {{convert|2450|m}} above it. The tunnel then passes below the valley of the Rein da Medel (Val Medel) and west of [[Lai da Sontga Maria]]. After a few kilometres the tunnel crosses the watershed between the Anterior Rhine and the Ticino, just north of [[Pizzo dell'Uomo]] ({{convert|2525|m}}). This point corresponds to the [[main chain of the Alps]], and is the main drainage divide between the [[Rhine]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]]. For a few kilometres, the tunnel passes below two western tributaries of the [[Brenno]] in the [[Valle Santa Maria]] before crossing the last range, west of the [[Passo Pred\u00e8lp]] (about {{convert|2500|m}}) and east of [[Faido]]. It then follows the eastern slopes of the large [[Valle Leventina]], the valley of the Ticino, for about {{convert|18|km}} to the south portal at [[Bodio]], at an elevation of {{convert|312|m}}, just {{convert|3|km}} before [[Biasca]], where the Brenno converges with the Ticino.<ref group=note>See [[Swisstopo]] topographic maps with catchment areas layer: [https://s.geo.admin.ch/6a25d7c210 map.geo.admin.ch].</ref>\n\nThe closest railway stations to the portals are [[Altdorf railway station (Switzerland)|Altdorf]] and [[Biasca railway station|Biasca]]. The first regularly served railway stations on the base line (as of 2016/17) are those of [[Arth-Goldau railway station|Arth-Goldau]] ([[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]), a railway node with links to [[Lucerne railway station|Lucerne]] and [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Z\u00fcrich]], and [[Bellinzona railway station|Bellinzona]] (the \"Gate of Ticino\"), with links to [[Locarno railway station|Locarno]], [[Cadenazzo\u2013Luino railway|Luino]] and [[Lugano railway station|Lugano]] (via the [[Monte Ceneri Rail Tunnel]]). The journey from Arth-Goldau to Bellinzona takes not more than an hour. The station of Altdorf is planned to be served by 2021. There also have been talks of using that of Biasca. The travel between Altdorf and Biasca would last less than 25 minutes.\n\n{{gallery\n|align = center\n|title = '''Accesses to the GBT complex'''\n|File:GBT north.jpg\n|Erstfeld, north portal, {{convert|460|m|||}} a.s.l.\n|File:Amsteg - GBT Access Tunnel (30793268472).jpg\n|Amsteg portal (maintenance access), {{convert|507|m|||}} a.s.l.\n|File:Sedrun Portal and Bridge.jpg\n|Sedrun portal (maintenance access, bridge over the Anterior Rhine), {{convert|1334|m|||}}  a.s.l.\n|File:AlpTransit NEAT - Baustelle Faido TI (22201920956).jpg\n|Faido portal (maintenance access), {{convert|757|m|||}}  a.s.l.\n|File:GBT south.jpg\n|Biasca, south portal, {{convert|312|m|||}}  a.s.l.\n}}\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Gotthard Pass|Gotthard Railway}}\nSince the 13th century, the {{convert|2106|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} Gotthard Pass has been an important trade route from northern to southern Europe. Control of its access routes led to the birth of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. The Gotthard Pass is located halfway between [[Lake Lucerne]] and [[Lake Maggiore]]. It is the shortest link between the navigable [[Rhine]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]]. The traverse of the pass took days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tellier |first=Luc-Normand |date=2009 |title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&printsec=frontcover |location=Quebec City, Canada  |publisher=Presses de l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec |page=314 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nQuite late, compared to other pass routes through the Alps on a north\u2013south axis (e.g. [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]], [[San Bernardino Pass|San Bernardino]], [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]]), namely in 1822, the first Saint-Gotthard Pass road was established after centuries-long usage of a [[bridle path]]. From 1842 onwards, a daily course by the ''Gotthard Post'', a stagecoach drawn by five horses with ten seats, still took about 23 hours from [[Como]] to [[Fl\u00fcelen]].\n[[File:Koller Gotthardpost 1873.jpg|thumb|\"The Gotthard Post\" on the [[Tremola San Gottardo|Tremola]] road (1873 painting by [[Rudolf Koller]])]]\n\nIn 1882, with the inauguration of the [[Gotthard Railway Tunnel]], the travel time between [[Altdorf, Switzerland|Altdorf]] and [[Biasca]] was reduced dramatically to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in huge [[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]-hotels, for example in Biasca. In those days, it was still an adventure and it was only affordable to the very rich.\n\nIn the autumn of 1921, the final stagecoach traversed the pass.\n\nElectrification of the railway line in 1922 significantly reduced travel time even more.  Refilling water boilers of steam locomotives was no longer necessary. There were also the technical advantages of electrical engines and future technical improvements.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the first car traversed the pass in 1895. The first reported{{where|date=February 2019}} surmounting of the pass in 1901 still took more than a day.\n\nFrom 1924, car transport on trains through the railway tunnel began.  The sections between [[G\u00f6schenen]] and [[Andermatt]], the [[Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge|Sch\u00f6llenen ravine]], and especially the [[Tremola San Gottardo|Tremola]], had countless hairpin turns and serpentine curves from the peak of the pass to [[Airolo]] on the southern side of the pass, dropping {{convert|1000|m}} in altitude, posing a huge challenge for automobiles.\n[[File:Gotthard Autoverlad.jpg|thumb|Cars transport on trains in the 1930s]]\n\nFrom 1953 onwards, the pass road was sequentially improved and expanded at several sections along the Gotthard route, finally ending in 1977 with the opening of an expressway fully circumventing the Tremola.\n[[File:Gotthard Alte Passstrasse.jpg|thumb|The old pass road, the ''Tremola'']]\n\nTransit time was further dramatically reduced with the opening of the [[Gotthard Road Tunnel]] and the finalization of the northern part of [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] through the ''Urner Reusstal'', with many additional tunnels (then leading from Basel to the Gotthard Road Tunnel), in 1980. With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the [[Valle Leventina]], the huge valley leading from Airolo down to [[Bellinzona]], and the surmounting of the [[Monte Ceneri]] between Bellinzona and [[Lugano]] in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in [[Basel]] to the southern border in [[Chiasso]], or the shortest motorway route from North-German [[Hamburg]] as far as South-Italian [[Sicilly]], bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line.<ref>{{cite news |date=5 December 2016 |author=[[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse]] |title=Trois heures en 20 ans, le temps gagn\u00e9 pour traverser l'Europe par le Gothard |trans-title= |url=https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/7708495-trois-heures-en-20-ans-le-temps-gagne-pour-traverser-l-europe-par-le-gothard.html |language=French |work= |location= |access-date=2017-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nToday, both the rail and the road routes are among the most important passages through the Alps on the north\u2013south axis.\n\nAfter the opening of the auto tunnel, in 1980, traffic increased more than tenfold.

The GBT substantially contributes to the requirements of both laws and enables a direct flat route from the ports of the [[North Sea]] (notably Rotterdam) to those of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (notably Genoa), via the Rhine corridor.\n\nPassenger trains can travel up to {{convert|250|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} through the GBT, currently reducing travel times for trans-Alpine train journeys by about 40 minutes,<!--38 minutes in 2017--> and by one hour once the adjacent [[Zimmerberg Base Tunnel|Zimmerberg]] and [[Ceneri Base Tunnel]]s are completed. This is viewed as a revolution, especially in the isolated region of Ticino, which is separated from the rest of the country by the Alps and the Gotthard. The two stations of [[Bellinzona railway station|Bellinzona]] and [[Lugano railway station|Lugano]] (respectively named \"Gate of Ticino\" and \"Terrace of Ticino\") were entirely renovated for the opening of the GBT, among other improvements.\n\nAs of 2016, the Gotthard Base Tunnel is the [[List of longest tunnels|longest railway tunnel in the world]].

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS)]].\n\nTo cut construction time in half, four access tunnels were built so that construction could start at four different sites simultaneously: Erstfeld, Amsteg, Sedrun, and Faido. A fifth&nbsp;at Bodio&nbsp;was added later. The two tunnels are joined approximately every {{convert|325|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} by connecting galleries.

It is referred to as a \"[[base tunnel]]\" since it bypasses most of the existing [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard railway line]], a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]], which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT.

This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks, and reduces the [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]] caused by heavy trucks.

Unlike most other tunnels, the Gotthard Base Tunnel passes under several distinct mountain massifs, two of them being major subranges of the Alps, the [[Glarus Alps]] and the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]], with the valley of the [[Anterior Rhine]], the [[Surselva]] in the [[canton of Graub\u00fcnden]], between them. The tunnel passes under these two ranges more than {{convert|2|km|ft|spell=in}} below the [[Chr\u00fczlistock]] ({{convert|2709|m|abbr=on}}) and the [[Piz Vatgira]] ({{convert|2983|m|abbr=on}}, near the [[Lukmanier Pass]]).

There, the tunnel penetrates the western slopes of the [[B\u00e4lmeten]] and [[Chli Windg\u00e4llen]] (although only marginally) before passing below the valley of the Ch\u00e4rstelenbach, a creek in the [[Maderanertal]]. From there, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of Etzli, below the [[Witenalpstock]]. The main crest of the Glarus Alps, which is the watershed between the Reuss and the Anterior Rhine, is crossed below the [[Chr\u00fczlistock]], the crest having an elevation of about {{convert|2700|m}} at this point. From the crest and border, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of the river Strem (Val Strem) before passing below [[Sedrun]] and the Anterior Rhine. From the bottom of the valley, the tunnel proceeds towards the valley of the Rein da Nalps (Val Nalps) and passes east of [[Lai da Nalps]], before crossing the Gannaretsch range below the western summit of [[Piz Vatgira]] ({{convert|2981|m}}). This is the deepest point of the tunnel, with a rock layer of {{convert|2450|m}} above it. The tunnel then passes below the valley of the Rein da Medel (Val Medel) and west of [[Lai da Sontga Maria]]. After a few kilometres the tunnel crosses the watershed between the Anterior Rhine and the Ticino, just north of [[Pizzo dell'Uomo]] ({{convert|2525|m}}). This point corresponds to the [[main chain of the Alps]], and is the main drainage divide between the [[Rhine]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]]. For a few kilometres, the tunnel passes below two western tributaries of the [[Brenno]] in the [[Valle Santa Maria]] before crossing the last range, west of the [[Passo Pred\u00e8lp]] (about {{convert|2500|m}}) and east of [[Faido]]. It then follows the eastern slopes of the large [[Valle Leventina]], the valley of the Ticino, for about {{convert|18|km}} to the south portal at [[Bodio]], at an elevation of {{convert|312|m}}, just {{convert|3|km}} before [[Biasca]], where the Brenno converges with the Ticino.<ref group=note>See [[Swisstopo]] topographic maps with catchment areas layer: [https://s.geo.admin.ch/6a25d7c210 map.geo.admin.ch].</ref>\n\nThe closest railway stations to the portals are [[Altdorf railway station (Switzerland)|Altdorf]] and [[Biasca railway station|Biasca]]. The first regularly served railway stations on the base line (as of 2016/17) are those of [[Arth-Goldau railway station|Arth-Goldau]] ([[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]), a railway node with links to [[Lucerne railway station|Lucerne]] and [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Z\u00fcrich]], and [[Bellinzona railway station|Bellinzona]] (the \"Gate of Ticino\"), with links to [[Locarno railway station|Locarno]], [[Cadenazzo\u2013Luino railway|Luino]] and [[Lugano railway station|Lugano]] (via the [[Monte Ceneri Rail Tunnel]]). The journey from Arth-Goldau to Bellinzona takes not more than an hour. The station of Altdorf is planned to be served by 2021. There also have been talks of using that of Biasca.

Control of its access routes led to the birth of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. The Gotthard Pass is located halfway between [[Lake Lucerne]] and [[Lake Maggiore]]. It is the shortest link between the navigable [[Rhine]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]]. The traverse of the pass took days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tellier |first=Luc-Normand |date=2009 |title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&printsec=frontcover |location=Quebec City, Canada  |publisher=Presses de l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec |page=314 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nQuite late, compared to other pass routes through the Alps on a north\u2013south axis (e.g. [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]], [[San Bernardino Pass|San Bernardino]], [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]]), namely in 1822, the first Saint-Gotthard Pass road was established after centuries-long usage of a [[bridle path]]. From 1842 onwards, a daily course by the ''Gotthard Post'', a stagecoach drawn by five horses with ten seats, still took about 23 hours from [[Como]] to [[Fl\u00fcelen]].\n[[File:Koller Gotthardpost 1873.jpg|thumb|\"The Gotthard Post\" on the [[Tremola San Gottardo|Tremola]] road (1873 painting by [[Rudolf Koller]])]]\n\nIn 1882, with the inauguration of the [[Gotthard Railway Tunnel]], the travel time between [[Altdorf, Switzerland|Altdorf]] and [[Biasca]] was reduced dramatically to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in huge [[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]-hotels, for example in Biasca. In those days, it was still an adventure and it was only affordable to the very rich.\n\nIn the autumn of 1921, the final stagecoach traversed the pass.\n\nElectrification of the railway line in 1922 significantly reduced travel time even more.  Refilling water boilers of steam locomotives was no longer necessary. There were also the technical advantages of electrical engines and future technical improvements.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the first car traversed the pass in 1895. The first reported{{where|date=February 2019}} surmounting of the pass in 1901 still took more than a day.\n\nFrom 1924, car transport on trains through the railway tunnel began.  The sections between [[G\u00f6schenen]] and [[Andermatt]], the [[Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge|Sch\u00f6llenen ravine]], and especially the [[Tremola San Gottardo|Tremola]], had countless hairpin turns and serpentine curves from the peak of the pass to [[Airolo]] on the southern side of the pass, dropping {{convert|1000|m}} in altitude, posing a huge challenge for automobiles.\n[[File:Gotthard Autoverlad.jpg|thumb|Cars transport on trains in the 1930s]]\n\nFrom 1953 onwards, the pass road was sequentially improved and expanded at several sections along the Gotthard route, finally ending in 1977 with the opening of an expressway fully circumventing the Tremola.\n[[File:Gotthard Alte Passstrasse.jpg|thumb|The old pass road, the ''Tremola'']]\n\nTransit time was further dramatically reduced with the opening of the [[Gotthard Road Tunnel]] and the finalization of the northern part of [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] through the ''Urner Reusstal'', with many additional tunnels (then leading from Basel to the Gotthard Road Tunnel), in 1980. With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the [[Valle Leventina]], the huge valley leading from Airolo down to [[Bellinzona]], and the surmounting of the [[Monte Ceneri]] between Bellinzona and [[Lugano]] in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in [[Basel]] to the southern border in [[Chiasso]], or the shortest motorway route from North-German [[Hamburg]] as far as South-Italian [[Sicilly]], bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line.<ref>{{cite news |date=5 December 2016 |author=[[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse]] |title=Trois heures en 20 ans, le temps gagn\u00e9 pour traverser l'Europe par le Gothard |trans-title= |url=https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/7708495-trois-heures-en-20-ans-le-temps-gagne-pour-traverser-l-europe-par-le-gothard.html |language=French |work= |location= |access-date=2017-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nToday, both the rail and the road routes are among the most important passages through the Alps on the north\u2013south axis.\n\nAfter the opening of the auto tunnel, in 1980, traffic increased more than tenfold.

The GBT substantially contributes to the requirements of both laws and enables a direct flat route from the ports of the [[North Sea]] (notably Rotterdam) to those of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (notably Genoa), via the Rhine corridor.\n\nPassenger trains can travel up to {{convert|250|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} through the GBT, currently reducing travel times for trans-Alpine train journeys by about 40 minutes,<!--38 minutes in 2017--> and by one hour once the adjacent [[Zimmerberg Base Tunnel|Zimmerberg]] and [[Ceneri Base Tunnel]]s are completed.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS)]].\n\nTo cut construction time in half, four access tunnels were built so that construction could start at four different sites simultaneously: Erstfeld, Amsteg, Sedrun, and Faido. A fifth&nbsp;at Bodio&nbsp;was added later. The two tunnels are joined approximately every {{convert|325|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} by connecting galleries. Trains can move between the tunnels in the two multifunction stations at [[Sedrun]] and [[Faido]]. These stations house ventilation equipment and technical infrastructure and serve as emergency stops and evacuation routes.<ref name=\"malins\"/>\n\nAccess to the Sedrun station site is by a level access tunnel {{convert|1|km|mi|sigfig=4|1|abbr=on}} long from the valley floor near Sedrun. At the end of the access tunnel, two vertical shafts lead {{convert|800|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} down to the base tunnel level. A proposal to construct a functioning railway station, called ''[[Porta Alpina]]'' (from [[Romansh language|Romansh]], \"Alpine Gate\"), at this site was evaluated, but the project was put on hold in 2007 and definitively cancelled by the federal authorities in 2012 as uneconomical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bundesrat best\u00e4tigt vorl\u00e4ufigen Verzicht auf die Porta Alpina|url=https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=de&msg-id=44585|date=16 May 2012|publisher=Press release, Swiss federal authorities|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe final breakthrough in the east tube occurred on 15 October 2010 at 14:17 +02:00.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alptransit.ch/en/media/press-releases/detail/article/final-breakthrough-of-the-longest-railway-tunnel-in-the-world/ |title=Final breakthrough of the longest railway tunnel in the world |publisher=AlpTransit Gotthard AG |date=15 October 2010 |location=Lucerne, Switzerland |accessdate=2017-06-05}}</ref> The final breakthrough in the west tube occurred on 23 March 2011 at 12:20.<ref name=\"bedding\">{{cite news |title=Switzerland's Gotthard Base train tunnel is redefining Europe |last=Bedding |first=James |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/journeysbyrail/9880313/Switzerlands-Gotthard-Base-train-tunnel-is-redefining-Europe.html |date=19 February 2013 |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.alptransit.ch/en/media/press-releases/detail/article/gotthard-base-tunnel-driving-complete/ |title=Gotthard Base Tunnel: Driving complete |publisher=AlpTransit Gotthard AG |location=Lucerne, Switzerland |date=23 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 August 2013, the tunnel was entirely traversed for the first time from Bodio to Erstfeld in six hours, by diesel train, buses and by foot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corridor-rhine-alpine.eu/news-detail/switzerland-first-transit-in-the-gotthard-base-tunnel/cmd/clear.html |title=Switzerland: First transit in the Gotthard Base Tunnel |last= |first= |date= |website=corridor-rhine-alpine.eu |publisher= |access-date=7 December 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the operational test phase started on a {{convert|13|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch in the southern section of the west tube between Faido and Bodio.

Ireland has been inhabited for about 12,500 years according to archaeological studies (see [[Prehistoric Ireland]]). For most of Ireland's recorded history, the Irish have been primarily a [[Gaelic people]] (see [[Gaelic Ireland]]). From the 9th century, small numbers of [[Vikings]] settled in Ireland, becoming the [[Norse-Gaels]]. [[Anglo-Normans]] [[Norman invasion of Ireland|conquered parts of Ireland]] in the 12th century, while [[Kingdom of England|England's]] 16th/17th-century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|(re)conquest]] and [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation]] of Ireland brought many [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Scottish people|Scots]] people to parts of the island, especially the north. Today, Ireland is made up of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (an independent state) and the smaller [[Northern Ireland]] (a part of the [[United Kingdom]]). The [[people of Northern Ireland]] hold various national identities including British, Irish, Northern Irish or some combination thereof.\n\nThe Irish have their own customs, [[Irish language|language]], [[Folk music of Ireland|music]], [[Irish dance|dance]], [[Gaelic games|sports]], [[Irish cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Irish mythology|mythology]]. Although [[Irish language|Irish (Gaeilge)]] was their main language in the past, today most Irish people speak English as their first language. Historically, the Irish nation was made up of kin groups or [[Irish clans|clans]], and the Irish also had their own [[Celtic paganism|religion]], [[Early Irish law|law code]], [[Ogham|alphabet]] and [[Gaelic Ireland#Dress|style of dress]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere have been many notable Irish people throughout history. After [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)|Ireland's conversion to Christianity]], Irish missionaries and scholars [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|exerted great influence]] on Western Europe, and the Irish came to be seen as a nation of \"saints and scholars\".

The scientist [[Robert Boyle]] is considered the \"father of [[chemistry]]\", and [[Robert Mallet]] one of the \"fathers of [[seismology]]\". Famous Irish writers include [[Oscar Wilde]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[James Joyce]], [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Notable Irish explorers include [[Brendan the Navigator]], [[Robert McClure|Sir Robert McClure]], [[Sir Alexander Armstrong]], [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]]. By some accounts, the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides.<ref name=\"Smiley630\">Smiley, p. 630</ref> Many [[List of Presidents of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have had some Irish ancestry.\n\nThe population of Ireland is about 6.3 million, but it is estimated that 50 to 80 million people around the world have Irish forebears, making the [[Irish diaspora]] one of the largest of any nation. Historically, emigration from Ireland has been the result of conflict, famine and economic issues. People of Irish descent are found mainly in English-speaking countries, especially [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Irish Americans|United States]], [[Irish Canadians|Canada]] and [[Irish Australians|Australia]]. There are also significant numbers in [[Irish Argentine|Argentina]], [[Irish immigration to Mexico|Mexico]], [[Irish New Zealanders|New Zealand]] and [[Irish Brazilians|Brazil]]. The United States has the most people of Irish descent, while in Australia those of Irish descent are a higher percentage of the population than in any other country outside Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail1987042900006#N6 |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 29/Apr/1987 Ceisteanna\u2014Questions.

Neither their languages nor the terms they used to describe themselves have survived.\n\nIreland itself was known by a number of different names, including [[Banba]], [[F\u00f3dla]], [[\u00c9riu]] by the islanders, ''Iouerne'' and ''Hiverne'' to the [[Greeks]], and [[Hibernia]] to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Pytheas]] made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325&nbsp;BC, but his account of it, known widely in [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others.

This etymology shows that Pytheas interacted not so much with Irish, as they used Q-Celtic. Rather, Pytheas brought back the P-Celtic form from more geographically accessible regions where Welsh or Breton are spoken presently. Furthermore, some proto-Celtic was spoken over all of Greater Britain, and this particular spelling is prototypical of those more populous regions. [[Diodorus]], based on Pytheas reports that Britain is cold and subject to frosts, being \"too much subject to the [[Ursa Major|Bear]]\", and not \"under the Arctic pole\", as some translations say.<ref name=diodV>{{cite book|first=Diodori|last=Siculi|title=Bibliothecae Historicae Libri Qui Supersunt: Nova Editio|editor=Peter Wesseling|author2=L.

Other [[Latin]] names for people from Ireland in Classic and Mediaeval sources include [[Attacotti]] and [[Gael]]. This last word, derived from the [[Old Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwyddel'' \"raiders\", was eventually adopted by the Irish for themselves. However, as a term it is on a par with [[Viking]], as it describes an activity (raiding, piracy) and its proponents, not their actual ethnic affiliations.\n\nThe terms ''Irish'' and ''Ireland'' are probably derived from the goddess [[\u00c9riu]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Erin |volume=9 |page=744}}</ref> A variety of historical ethnic groups have inhabited the island, including the [[Airgialla]], [[Fir Ol nEchmacht]], [[Delbhna]], [[Fir Bolg]], [[\u00c9rainn]], [[E\u00f3ganachta]], [[Mairtine]], [[Conmaicne]], [[Soghain]], and [[Ulaid]]. In the cases of the Conmaicne, Delbhna, and perhaps \u00c9rainn, it can be demonstrated that the tribe took their name from their chief deity, or in the case of the Ciannachta, E\u00f3ganachta, and possibly the Soghain, a deified ancestor. This practice is paralleled by the [[Anglo-Saxon]] dynasties' claims of descent from [[Woden]], via his sons [[Wecta]], [[Baeldaeg]], [[Casere]] and [[Wihtlaeg]].\n\nThe [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mythographer]] [[Euhemerus]] originated the concept of [[Euhemerism]], which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of actual historical events shaped by retelling and traditional mores. In the 12th century, [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] [[bard]] and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposed that the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods were originally historical war leaders and kings, who later became cult figures, eventually set into society as gods. This view is in agreement with Irish historians such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] and [[Francis John Byrne]]; the early chapters of their respective books, ''Early Irish history and mythology'' (reprinted 2004) and ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'' (3rd revised edition, 2001), deal in depth with the origins and status of many Irish ancestral deities.\n\nOne legend states that the Irish were descended from one [[M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine]], whose sons supposedly conquered Ireland around 1000 BC or later.<ref>Mac Manus, p 1 & 7</ref> The character is almost certainly a mere personification of a supposed migration by a group or groups from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] to Ireland. It is from this that the Irish were, as late as the 1800s, popularly known as \"[[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]]\".<ref>MacManus, p 1</ref> Medieval Irish historians, over the course of several centuries, created the [[genealogical]] [[dogma]] that all Irish were descendants of M\u00edl, ignoring the fact that their own works demonstrated inhabitants in Ireland prior to his supposed arrival.\n\nThis [[doctrine]] was adapted between the 10th and 12th centuries, as demonstrated in the works of [[Eochaidh Ua Floinn]] (936\u20131004); [[Flann Mainistrech]] (died 25 November 1056); Tanaide (died c. 1075) and [[Gilla C\u00f3m\u00e1in mac Gilla Samthainde]] (fl. 1072). Many of their compositions were incorporated into the compendium [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]].\n\nThis tradition was enhanced and embedded in the tradition by successive historians such as [[Dubs\u00failech \u00d3 Maolconaire]] (died 1270); [[Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r \u00d3 Dubhag\u00e1in]] (d.1372); [[Giolla \u00cdosa M\u00f3r Mac Fir Bhisigh]] (fl. 1390\u20131418); [[Pilip Ballach \u00d3 Duibhgeann\u00e1in]] (fl. 1579\u20131590) and Flann Mac Aodhag\u00e1in (alive 1640). The first Irish historian who questioned the reliability of such accounts was [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] (murdered 1671).\n\n===Genetics===\n{{See also|Genetic history of Europe|Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe|Genetic history of the British Isles}}\n\nGenetic research shows a strong similarity between the [[Y chromosome]] [[haplotypes]] of Irish men with [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] surnames, and males from the area of Spain and Portugal, especially Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria (and perhaps former Basque country).<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15309688 |title=Brian McEvoy, et al., \"The Longue Dur\u00e9e of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe| journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | date=October 2004 |doi=10.1086/424697 |volume=75 |issue=4 |pmc=1182057 |pages=693\u2013702 | last1 = McEvoy | first1 = B | last2 = Richards | first2 = M | last3 = Forster | first3 = P | last4 = Bradley | first4 = DG}}</ref> The incidence of the [[Haplogroup R-M269|R1b-M269 haplogroup]] is 70% or more in Ireland, [[Cumbria]] and [[Cornwall]] in England, the [[Norte Region, Portugal|Northern]] region in Portugal ([[Douro Litoral Province|Douro Litoral]], [[Minho Province|Minho]] and [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro]]), northern [[Spain]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Le\u00f3n (historical region)|Le\u00f3n]], [[Cantabria]] and [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]), western France ([[Gascony]], [[Saintonge]], [[Poitou]], and [[Brittany]]), and [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] in Britain.

The proper surname for a woman in Irish uses the feminine prefix nic (meaning daughter) in place of mac. Thus a boy may be called Mac Domhnaill whereas his sister would be called Nic Dhomhnaill or N\u00ed Dhomhnaill \u2013 the insertion of 'h' follows the female prefix in the case of most consonants (bar H, L, N, R, & T).\n\nA son has the same surname as his father. A female's surname replaces \u00d3 with N\u00ed (reduced from In\u00edon U\u00ed \u2013 \"daughter of the grandson of\") and Mac with Nic (reduced from In\u00edon Mhic \u2013 \"daughter of the son of\"); in both cases the following name undergoes lenition. However, if the second part of the surname begins with the letter C or G, it is not lenited after Nic.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Thus the daughter of a man named \u00d3 Maolag\u00e1in has the surname ''N\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in'' and the daughter of a man named Mac Gearailt has the surname ''Nic Gearailt''. When anglicised, the name can remain O' or Mac, regardless of gender.\n\nThere are a number of Irish surnames derived from Norse personal names, including [[Clan Sweeney|Mac Suibhne]] (Sweeney) from Swein and McAuliffe from \"Olaf\".  The name [[Cotter family|Cotter]], local to [[County Cork]], derives from the Norse personal name Ottir. The name [[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]] is an Anglicization of the Irish Mac Raghnaill, itself originating from the Norse names Randal or Reginald. Though these names were of Viking derivation some of the families who bear them appear to have had Gaelic origins.\n\n\"Fitz\" is an old Norman French variant of the Old French word ''fils'' (variant spellings filz, fiuz, fiz, etc.), used by the Normans, meaning ''son''. The [[Normans]] themselves were descendants of [[Vikings]], who had settled in [[Normandy]] and thoroughly adopted the French language and culture.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Normans |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/NORMANS.HTM |author=Richard Hooker |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614140152/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/NORMANS.HTM |archivedate=14 June 2008 }}</ref> With the exception of the Gaelic-Irish [[Fitzpatrick (name)|Fitzpatrick]] ([[Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig]]) surname, all names that begin with Fitz \u2013 including [[FitzGerald]] (Mac Gearailt), [[Fitzsimons]] (Mac S\u00edom\u00f3in/Mac an Ridire) and FitzHenry (Mac Anra\u00ed) \u2013 are descended from the initial Norman settlers. A small number of Irish families of [[Goidelic]] origin came to use a Norman form of their original surname\u2014so that Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig became Fitzpatrick\u2014while some assimilated so well that the Irish name was dropped in favor of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Another common Irish surname of [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman Irish]] origin is the 'de' habitational prefix, meaning 'of' and originally signifying prestige and land ownership. Examples include de B\u00farca (Burke), de Br\u00fan, de Barra (Barry), de Stac (Stack), de Ti\u00fait, de Faoite (White), de Londras (Landers), de Paor (Power). The Irish surname \"Walsh\" (in Irish ''Breathnach'') was routinely given to settlers of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] origin, who had come during and after the Norman invasion. The Joyce and Griffin/Griffith (Gruffydd) families are also of Welsh origin.\n\nThe Mac Lochlainn, \u00d3 Maol Seachlainn, \u00d3 Maol Seachnaill, \u00d3 Conchobhair, Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmada families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has been diminished with the loss of prefixes such as \u00d3 and Mac. Different branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief of the clan \u00d3 Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An Sionnach (Fox), which his descendants use to this day. Similar surnames are often found in Scotland for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish migration to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries.\n\n===Late Medieval and Tudor Ireland===\n{{See also|Gaelic Ireland|Lordship of Ireland}}\n\n[[File:Galloglass-circa-1521.jpg|thumb|Gaelic Irish soldiers in the [[Low Countries]], from a drawing of 1521 by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]]]\nThe Irish people of the Late Middle Ages were active as traders on the European continent.<ref name=autogenerated1>MacManus, p 343</ref> They were distinguished from the English (who only used their own language or French) in that they only used [[Latin]] abroad\u2014a language \"spoken by all educated people throughout Gaeldom\".<ref>MacManus, p 340</ref> According to the writer [[Seumas MacManus]], the explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] visited Ireland to gather information about the lands to the west,<ref name=\"MacManus343\">MacManus, p 343\u2013344</ref> a number of Irish names are recorded on Columbus' crew roster preserved in the archives of [[Madrid]] and it was an Irishman named Patrick Maguire who was the first to set foot in the [[Americas]] in 1492;<ref name=\"MacManus343\"/> however, according to [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Morison]] and Miss Gould{{clarify|date=January 2018}}, who made a detailed study of the crew list of 1492, no Irish or English sailors were involved in the voyage.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Paolo Emilio Taviani|first=Paolo Emilio|last=Taviani|title=Christopher Columbus|page=[https://archive.org/details/christophercolum00tavi/page/376 376]|isbn=978-0-85613-922-2|year=1985|url=https://archive.org/details/christophercolum00tavi/page/376}}</ref>\n\nAn English report of 1515 states that the Irish people were divided into over sixty Gaelic lordships and thirty Anglo-Irish lordships.<ref name=\"Nicholls\">Nicholls <!--page number needed--></ref> The English term for these lordships was \"nation\" or \"country\".<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> The Irish term \"''oireacht''\" referred to both the territory and the people ruled by the lord.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Literally, it meant an \"assembly\", where the [[Brehon]]s would hold their courts upon hills to arbitrate the matters of the lordship.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Indeed, the Tudor lawyer [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]] described the Irish people with respect to their laws:\n\n{{blockquote|There is no people under the sun that doth love equal and indifferent (impartial) justice better than the Irish, or will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof, although it be against themselves, as they may have the protection and benefit of the law upon which just cause they do desire it.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/>}}\n\nAnother English commentator records that the assemblies were attended by \"all the scum of the country\"\u2014the labouring population as well as the landowners.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> While the distinction between \"free\" and \"unfree\" elements of the Irish people was unreal in legal terms, it was a social and economic reality.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Social mobility was usually downwards, due to social and economic pressures.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> The ruling clan's \"expansion from the top downwards\" was constantly displacing commoners and forcing them into the margins of society.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/>\n\nAs a clan-based society, [[genealogy]] was all important.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Ireland 'was justly styled a \"Nation of Annalists\"'.<ref>MacManus, p 352</ref> The various branches of Irish learning\u2014including law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine\u2014were associated with hereditary learned families.<ref name=\"Jefferies\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |title=Culture and Religion in Tudor Ireland, 1494\u20131558 |last=Jefferies |first=Dr. Henry A |publisher=[[University College Cork]] |accessdate=2008-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416173828/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |archivedate=16 April 2008 }}</ref> The poetic families included the [[\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh|U\u00ed Dh\u00e1laigh]] (Daly) and the [[MacGrath (disambiguation)|MacGrath]].<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Irish physicians, such as the O'Briens in [[Munster]] or the MacCailim Mor in the [[Western Isles]], were renowned in the courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries.<ref name=\"multiref1\">MacManus, p 348</ref> Learning was not exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however;

Starving people who tried to eat them would only vomit it back up soon afterwards. Soup kitchens were set up but made little difference. The English government produced little aid, only sending raw corn known as '[[Peel's Brimstone]]' to Ireland. It was known by this name after the British PM at the time and the fact that native Irish weren't aware on how to cook corn. This led to little or no improvement. The British government set up workhouses which were disease ridden (with cholera, TB and others) but they also failed as little food was available and many died on arrival as they were overworked. Some English political figures at the time saw the famine as a purge from God to exterminate the majority of the native Irish population.\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|260px|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nIrish people emigrated to escape the famine journeying predominantly to the east coast of the US especially Boston and New York, Liverpool in England, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Many records show the majority of emigrants to Australia were in fact prisoners sent to assist in the construction of English colonies there. A substantial proportion of these committed crimes in hopes of being extradited to Australia, favouring it to the persecution and hardships they endured in their homeland. Emigrants travelled on '[[Coffin ship|Coffin Ships]]' they were called this as there were high mortality rates on board. Many died of disease or starved. Conditions on board were abysmal - tickets were expensive so stowaways were common, little food stuff was given to passengers who were simply viewed as cargo in the eyes of the ship workers. Famous coffin ships include the [[Jeanie Johnston]] and the [[Dunbrody (1845)|Dunbrody]].\n\nThere are many statues and memorials in Dublin, New York and other cities in memory of the famine. [[The Fields of Athenry|The fields of Athenry]] is a famous song about the great famine and is often sung at national team sporting events in memory and homage to those affected by the famine.\n\nThe Great famine is one of the biggest events in Irish history and is ingrained in the identity on the nation to this day.

Ireland has been inhabited for about 12,500 years according to archaeological studies (see [[Prehistoric Ireland]]). For most of Ireland's recorded history, the Irish have been primarily a [[Gaelic people]] (see [[Gaelic Ireland]]). From the 9th century, small numbers of [[Vikings]] settled in Ireland, becoming the [[Norse-Gaels]]. [[Anglo-Normans]] [[Norman invasion of Ireland|conquered parts of Ireland]] in the 12th century, while [[Kingdom of England|England's]] 16th/17th-century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|(re)conquest]] and [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation]] of Ireland brought many [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Scottish people|Scots]] people to parts of the island, especially the north. Today, Ireland is made up of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (an independent state) and the smaller [[Northern Ireland]] (a part of the [[United Kingdom]]). The [[people of Northern Ireland]] hold various national identities including British, Irish, Northern Irish or some combination thereof.\n\nThe Irish have their own customs, [[Irish language|language]], [[Folk music of Ireland|music]], [[Irish dance|dance]], [[Gaelic games|sports]], [[Irish cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Irish mythology|mythology]]. Although [[Irish language|Irish (Gaeilge)]] was their main language in the past, today most Irish people speak English as their first language. Historically, the Irish nation was made up of kin groups or [[Irish clans|clans]], and the Irish also had their own [[Celtic paganism|religion]], [[Early Irish law|law code]], [[Ogham|alphabet]] and [[Gaelic Ireland#Dress|style of dress]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere have been many notable Irish people throughout history. After [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)|Ireland's conversion to Christianity]], Irish missionaries and scholars [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|exerted great influence]] on Western Europe, and the Irish came to be seen as a nation of \"saints and scholars\". The 6th-century Irish monk and missionary [[Columbanus]] is regarded as one of the \"fathers of Europe\",<ref name=\"ColumbanusZenit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-22867|title=Pope Calls Irish Monk a Father of Europe|accessdate=2007-07-15|date=2007-07-11|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency|Zenit]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615013728/http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-22867|archivedate=15 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> followed by saints [[Saint Kilian|Cillian]] and [[Vergilius of Salzburg|Fergal]]. The scientist [[Robert Boyle]] is considered the \"father of [[chemistry]]\", and [[Robert Mallet]] one of the \"fathers of [[seismology]]\". Famous Irish writers include [[Oscar Wilde]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[James Joyce]], [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Notable Irish explorers include [[Brendan the Navigator]], [[Robert McClure|Sir Robert McClure]], [[Sir Alexander Armstrong]], [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]]. By some accounts, the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides.<ref name=\"Smiley630\">Smiley, p. 630</ref> Many [[List of Presidents of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have had some Irish ancestry.\n\nThe population of Ireland is about 6.3 million, but it is estimated that 50 to 80 million people around the world have Irish forebears, making the [[Irish diaspora]] one of the largest of any nation. Historically, emigration from Ireland has been the result of conflict, famine and economic issues. People of Irish descent are found mainly in English-speaking countries, especially [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Irish Americans|United States]], [[Irish Canadians|Canada]] and [[Irish Australians|Australia]]. There are also significant numbers in [[Irish Argentine|Argentina]], [[Irish immigration to Mexico|Mexico]], [[Irish New Zealanders|New Zealand]] and [[Irish Brazilians|Brazil]]. The United States has the most people of Irish descent, while in Australia those of Irish descent are a higher percentage of the population than in any other country outside Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail1987042900006#N6 |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 29/Apr/1987 Ceisteanna\u2014Questions.

The ancient peoples of Ireland\u2014such as the creators of the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]] and [[Newgrange]]\u2014are almost unknown. Neither their languages nor the terms they used to describe themselves have survived.\n\nIreland itself was known by a number of different names, including [[Banba]], [[F\u00f3dla]], [[\u00c9riu]] by the islanders, ''Iouerne'' and ''Hiverne'' to the [[Greeks]], and [[Hibernia]] to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Pytheas]] made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325&nbsp;BC, but his account of it, known widely in [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others.

This etymology shows that Pytheas interacted not so much with Irish, as they used Q-Celtic. Rather, Pytheas brought back the P-Celtic form from more geographically accessible regions where Welsh or Breton are spoken presently. Furthermore, some proto-Celtic was spoken over all of Greater Britain, and this particular spelling is prototypical of those more populous regions. [[Diodorus]], based on Pytheas reports that Britain is cold and subject to frosts, being \"too much subject to the [[Ursa Major|Bear]]\", and not \"under the Arctic pole\", as some translations say.<ref name=diodV>{{cite book|first=Diodori|last=Siculi|title=Bibliothecae Historicae Libri Qui Supersunt: Nova Editio|editor=Peter Wesseling|author2=L.

They are ruled by many kings and princes who live in peace with each other. Their troops fight from chariots, as did the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]].\n[[File:St Fagans Celtic Village the main hut.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of a Celtic thatched hut in [[Wales]].]]\n[[Scotland]] takes its name from Scota, who in Irish mythology, Scottish mythology, and pseudohistory, is the name given to two different mythological daughters of two different Egyptian Pharaohs to whom the Gaels traced their ancestry, allegedly explaining the name Scoti, applied by the Romans to Irish raiders, and later to the Irish invaders of [[Argyll]] and [[Caledonia]] which became known as Scotland. Other [[Latin]] names for people from Ireland in Classic and Mediaeval sources include [[Attacotti]] and [[Gael]]. This last word, derived from the [[Old Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwyddel'' \"raiders\", was eventually adopted by the Irish for themselves. However, as a term it is on a par with [[Viking]], as it describes an activity (raiding, piracy) and its proponents, not their actual ethnic affiliations.\n\nThe terms ''Irish'' and ''Ireland'' are probably derived from the goddess [[\u00c9riu]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Erin |volume=9 |page=744}}</ref> A variety of historical ethnic groups have inhabited the island, including the [[Airgialla]], [[Fir Ol nEchmacht]], [[Delbhna]], [[Fir Bolg]], [[\u00c9rainn]], [[E\u00f3ganachta]], [[Mairtine]], [[Conmaicne]], [[Soghain]], and [[Ulaid]]. In the cases of the Conmaicne, Delbhna, and perhaps \u00c9rainn, it can be demonstrated that the tribe took their name from their chief deity, or in the case of the Ciannachta, E\u00f3ganachta, and possibly the Soghain, a deified ancestor. This practice is paralleled by the [[Anglo-Saxon]] dynasties' claims of descent from [[Woden]], via his sons [[Wecta]], [[Baeldaeg]], [[Casere]] and [[Wihtlaeg]].\n\nThe [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mythographer]] [[Euhemerus]] originated the concept of [[Euhemerism]], which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of actual historical events shaped by retelling and traditional mores. In the 12th century, [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] [[bard]] and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposed that the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods were originally historical war leaders and kings, who later became cult figures, eventually set into society as gods. This view is in agreement with Irish historians such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] and [[Francis John Byrne]]; the early chapters of their respective books, ''Early Irish history and mythology'' (reprinted 2004) and ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'' (3rd revised edition, 2001), deal in depth with the origins and status of many Irish ancestral deities.\n\nOne legend states that the Irish were descended from one [[M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine]], whose sons supposedly conquered Ireland around 1000 BC or later.<ref>Mac Manus, p 1 & 7</ref> The character is almost certainly a mere personification of a supposed migration by a group or groups from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] to Ireland. It is from this that the Irish were, as late as the 1800s, popularly known as \"[[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]]\".<ref>MacManus, p 1</ref> Medieval Irish historians, over the course of several centuries, created the [[genealogical]] [[dogma]] that all Irish were descendants of M\u00edl, ignoring the fact that their own works demonstrated inhabitants in Ireland prior to his supposed arrival.\n\nThis [[doctrine]] was adapted between the 10th and 12th centuries, as demonstrated in the works of [[Eochaidh Ua Floinn]] (936\u20131004); [[Flann Mainistrech]] (died 25 November 1056); Tanaide (died c. 1075) and [[Gilla C\u00f3m\u00e1in mac Gilla Samthainde]] (fl. 1072). Many of their compositions were incorporated into the compendium [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]].\n\nThis tradition was enhanced and embedded in the tradition by successive historians such as [[Dubs\u00failech \u00d3 Maolconaire]] (died 1270); [[Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r \u00d3 Dubhag\u00e1in]] (d.1372); [[Giolla \u00cdosa M\u00f3r Mac Fir Bhisigh]] (fl. 1390\u20131418); [[Pilip Ballach \u00d3 Duibhgeann\u00e1in]] (fl. 1579\u20131590) and Flann Mac Aodhag\u00e1in (alive 1640).

The proper surname for a woman in Irish uses the feminine prefix nic (meaning daughter) in place of mac. Thus a boy may be called Mac Domhnaill whereas his sister would be called Nic Dhomhnaill or N\u00ed Dhomhnaill \u2013 the insertion of 'h' follows the female prefix in the case of most consonants (bar H, L, N, R, & T).\n\nA son has the same surname as his father. A female's surname replaces \u00d3 with N\u00ed (reduced from In\u00edon U\u00ed \u2013 \"daughter of the grandson of\") and Mac with Nic (reduced from In\u00edon Mhic \u2013 \"daughter of the son of\"); in both cases the following name undergoes lenition. However, if the second part of the surname begins with the letter C or G, it is not lenited after Nic.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Thus the daughter of a man named \u00d3 Maolag\u00e1in has the surname ''N\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in'' and the daughter of a man named Mac Gearailt has the surname ''Nic Gearailt''. When anglicised, the name can remain O' or Mac, regardless of gender.\n\nThere are a number of Irish surnames derived from Norse personal names, including [[Clan Sweeney|Mac Suibhne]] (Sweeney) from Swein and McAuliffe from \"Olaf\".  The name [[Cotter family|Cotter]], local to [[County Cork]], derives from the Norse personal name Ottir. The name [[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]] is an Anglicization of the Irish Mac Raghnaill, itself originating from the Norse names Randal or Reginald. Though these names were of Viking derivation some of the families who bear them appear to have had Gaelic origins.\n\n\"Fitz\" is an old Norman French variant of the Old French word ''fils'' (variant spellings filz, fiuz, fiz, etc.), used by the Normans, meaning ''son''. The [[Normans]] themselves were descendants of [[Vikings]], who had settled in [[Normandy]] and thoroughly adopted the French language and culture.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Normans |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/NORMANS.HTM |author=Richard Hooker |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614140152/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/NORMANS.HTM |archivedate=14 June 2008 }}</ref> With the exception of the Gaelic-Irish [[Fitzpatrick (name)|Fitzpatrick]] ([[Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig]]) surname, all names that begin with Fitz \u2013 including [[FitzGerald]] (Mac Gearailt), [[Fitzsimons]] (Mac S\u00edom\u00f3in/Mac an Ridire) and FitzHenry (Mac Anra\u00ed) \u2013 are descended from the initial Norman settlers. A small number of Irish families of [[Goidelic]] origin came to use a Norman form of their original surname\u2014so that Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig became Fitzpatrick\u2014while some assimilated so well that the Irish name was dropped in favor of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Another common Irish surname of [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman Irish]] origin is the 'de' habitational prefix, meaning 'of' and originally signifying prestige and land ownership. Examples include de B\u00farca (Burke), de Br\u00fan, de Barra (Barry), de Stac (Stack), de Ti\u00fait, de Faoite (White), de Londras (Landers), de Paor (Power). The Irish surname \"Walsh\" (in Irish ''Breathnach'') was routinely given to settlers of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] origin, who had come during and after the Norman invasion. The Joyce and Griffin/Griffith (Gruffydd) families are also of Welsh origin.\n\nThe Mac Lochlainn, \u00d3 Maol Seachlainn, \u00d3 Maol Seachnaill, \u00d3 Conchobhair, Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmada families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has been diminished with the loss of prefixes such as \u00d3 and Mac. Different branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief of the clan \u00d3 Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An Sionnach (Fox), which his descendants use to this day. Similar surnames are often found in Scotland for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish migration to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries.\n\n===Late Medieval and Tudor Ireland===\n{{See also|Gaelic Ireland|Lordship of Ireland}}\n\n[[File:Galloglass-circa-1521.jpg|thumb|Gaelic Irish soldiers in the [[Low Countries]], from a drawing of 1521 by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]]]\nThe Irish people of the Late Middle Ages were active as traders on the European continent.<ref name=autogenerated1>MacManus, p 343</ref> They were distinguished from the English (who only used their own language or French) in that they only used [[Latin]] abroad\u2014a language \"spoken by all educated people throughout Gaeldom\".<ref>MacManus, p 340</ref> According to the writer [[Seumas MacManus]], the explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] visited Ireland to gather information about the lands to the west,<ref name=\"MacManus343\">MacManus, p 343\u2013344</ref> a number of Irish names are recorded on Columbus' crew roster preserved in the archives of [[Madrid]] and it was an Irishman named Patrick Maguire who was the first to set foot in the [[Americas]] in 1492;<ref name=\"MacManus343\"/> however, according to [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Morison]] and Miss Gould{{clarify|date=January 2018}}, who made a detailed study of the crew list of 1492, no Irish or English sailors were involved in the voyage.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Paolo Emilio Taviani|first=Paolo Emilio|last=Taviani|title=Christopher Columbus|page=[https://archive.org/details/christophercolum00tavi/page/376 376]|isbn=978-0-85613-922-2|year=1985|url=https://archive.org/details/christophercolum00tavi/page/376}}</ref>\n\nAn English report of 1515 states that the Irish people were divided into over sixty Gaelic lordships and thirty Anglo-Irish lordships.<ref name=\"Nicholls\">Nicholls <!--page number needed--></ref> The English term for these lordships was \"nation\" or \"country\".<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> The Irish term \"''oireacht''\" referred to both the territory and the people ruled by the lord.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Literally, it meant an \"assembly\", where the [[Brehon]]s would hold their courts upon hills to arbitrate the matters of the lordship.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Indeed, the Tudor lawyer [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]] described the Irish people with respect to their laws:\n\n{{blockquote|There is no people under the sun that doth love equal and indifferent (impartial) justice better than the Irish, or will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof, although it be against themselves, as they may have the protection and benefit of the law upon which just cause they do desire it.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/>}}\n\nAnother English commentator records that the assemblies were attended by \"all the scum of the country\"\u2014the labouring population as well as the landowners.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> While the distinction between \"free\" and \"unfree\" elements of the Irish people was unreal in legal terms, it was a social and economic reality.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Social mobility was usually downwards, due to social and economic pressures.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> The ruling clan's \"expansion from the top downwards\" was constantly displacing commoners and forcing them into the margins of society.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/>\n\nAs a clan-based society, [[genealogy]] was all important.<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Ireland 'was justly styled a \"Nation of Annalists\"'.<ref>MacManus, p 352</ref> The various branches of Irish learning\u2014including law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine\u2014were associated with hereditary learned families.<ref name=\"Jefferies\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |title=Culture and Religion in Tudor Ireland, 1494\u20131558 |last=Jefferies |first=Dr. Henry A |publisher=[[University College Cork]] |accessdate=2008-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416173828/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |archivedate=16 April 2008 }}</ref> The poetic families included the [[\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh|U\u00ed Dh\u00e1laigh]] (Daly) and the [[MacGrath (disambiguation)|MacGrath]].<ref name=\"Nicholls\"/> Irish physicians, such as the O'Briens in [[Munster]] or the MacCailim Mor in the [[Western Isles]], were renowned in the courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries.<ref name=\"multiref1\">MacManus, p 348</ref> Learning was not exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however;

The famine lasted from 1845 - 1849, it was worst during 1847 which was known as Black '47.

Starving people who tried to eat them would only vomit it back up soon afterwards. Soup kitchens were set up but made little difference. The English government produced little aid, only sending raw corn known as '[[Peel's Brimstone]]' to Ireland. It was known by this name after the British PM at the time and the fact that native Irish weren't aware on how to cook corn. This led to little or no improvement. The British government set up workhouses which were disease ridden (with cholera, TB and others) but they also failed as little food was available and many died on arrival as they were overworked. Some English political figures at the time saw the famine as a purge from God to exterminate the majority of the native Irish population.\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|260px|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nIrish people emigrated to escape the famine journeying predominantly to the east coast of the US especially Boston and New York, Liverpool in England, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Many records show the majority of emigrants to Australia were in fact prisoners sent to assist in the construction of English colonies there. A substantial proportion of these committed crimes in hopes of being extradited to Australia, favouring it to the persecution and hardships they endured in their homeland. Emigrants travelled on '[[Coffin ship|Coffin Ships]]' they were called this as there were high mortality rates on board. Many died of disease or starved. Conditions on board were abysmal - tickets were expensive so stowaways were common, little food stuff was given to passengers who were simply viewed as cargo in the eyes of the ship workers. Famous coffin ships include the [[Jeanie Johnston]] and the [[Dunbrody (1845)|Dunbrody]].\n\nThere are many statues and memorials in Dublin, New York and other cities in memory of the famine. [[The Fields of Athenry|The fields of Athenry]] is a famous song about the great famine and is often sung at national team sporting events in memory and homage to those affected by the famine.\n\nThe Great famine is one of the biggest events in Irish history and is ingrained in the identity on the nation to this day.
