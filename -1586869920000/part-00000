The island got its start as a British fishing camp prior to settlement of the [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[Cod]] was harvested from the rich fishing grounds of the [[Gulf of Maine]], then dried on [[fish preservation|fish flakes]] before shipment to Europe.

The ''Anne'' had originally been captured off the [[Virginia Capes]] in April by the pirate [[Samuel Bellamy]] in the ''[[Whydah Gally|Whydah]]'', which wrecked in a storm on the night of April 26, 1717, off Cape Cod.  The ''Anne'' made it through the storm with another captured vessel, the ''Fisher'' (which was soon abandoned and the pirates aboard her transferred to the ''Anne'').

The pirates outfitted  for their own uses a small 25-ton [[sloop]] that the pirates had captured off Matinicus, one that formerly belonged to Colonel Stephen Minot.  They abandoned all the other vessels (including the ''Anne'') they had captured and most of their prisoners at Matinicus on or about May 9, 1717, on Minot's sloop.<ref>\"Deposition of Ralph Merry and Samuel Roberts\" Boston.

During [[King Philip's War]], dispossessed English settlers from the mainland sought refuge on the island before being relocated elsewhere along the coast. During [[King William's War]], the island was captured for the [[French people|French]] in 1689 by [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin|Baron de Saint-Castin]]. He destroyed the fishing fleet and burned the buildings, with many inhabitants escaping to [[Massachusetts]]. But even during periods when Monhegan was abandoned, its convenient offshore harbor remained a stopover destination for [[ship]]s. The end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 brought peace to the area, and on September 4, 1839, Mohegan \u2013 again under English Colonial control \u2013 was incorporated as an island plantation.<ref name=\"Coolidge\"/>\n\nIn 1824, a conical stone [[lighthouse]] was built on the island by order of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]]. Damaged by storms, it was replaced in 1850 by the present 48 foot (14.6 m) [[granite]] tower, with a [[fog]] bell station built in 1855 on nearby Manana Island. The island's {{convert|1,000|acre|ha}} of good land encouraged [[agriculture]], with [[potato]]es the chief crop. But fishing was always the most important industry, whether locally or at the [[Grand Banks]].

During [[King Philip's War]], dispossessed English settlers from the mainland sought refuge on the island before being relocated elsewhere along the coast. During [[King William's War]], the island was captured for the [[French people|French]] in 1689 by [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin|Baron de Saint-Castin]]. He destroyed the fishing fleet and burned the buildings, with many inhabitants escaping to [[Massachusetts]]. But even during periods when Monhegan was abandoned, its convenient offshore harbor remained a stopover destination for [[ship]]s. The end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 brought peace to the area, and on September 4, 1839, Mohegan - again under English Colonial control - was incorporated as an island plantation.<ref name=\"Coolidge\"/>\n\nIn 1824, a conical stone [[lighthouse]] was built on the island by order of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]]. Damaged by storms, it was replaced in 1850 by the present 48 foot (14.6 m) [[granite]] tower, with a [[fog]] bell station built in 1855 on nearby Manana Island. The island's {{convert|1,000|acre|ha}} of good land encouraged [[agriculture]], with [[potato]]es the chief crop.

She was the result of a one-night stand her mother Sharon Donovan had with [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]), a married man who lived near by. Johnny knew that Carla was probably his daughter, but for the sake of his marriage, he put aside the memory of his liaison with Sharon. He did, however, pay child support whenever Sharon was in trouble, which he managed to hide from his wife. Sharon lived in poverty on a run-down council estate. Carla was born into a world of alcohol and drugs, which Sharon sold from Carla's pram. Sharon had plenty of boyfriends and, a few years after Carla was born, she gave birth to her second child, [[Rob Donovan|Rob]] ([[Marc Baylis]]). She went on to marry George, who mistreated Carla and Rob and was hated by them. Carla's best friends growing up were [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) who lived in the nicer part of the estate. Michelle and her siblings were second cousins once removed of Johnny and third cousins of Johnny's children, [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate]] ([[Faye Brookes]]), with whom Carla was also friendly despite them being ten years younger than her. In 1993, Sharon told Lou about her affair with Johnny, leading Lou to run out of the house while arguing with Johnny and was fatally struck by a drunk driver. As a teenager, Carla worked Saturdays in a shoe shop and on her birthday in 1997 she started dating her future husband Paul, whom she married on 26 January 1999. With Paul earning good money, Carla's lifestyle changed for the better. For a while, she visited her family regularly but stopped as Rob constantly got at her for leaving him to deal with their mother's troubles alone. To ease her conscience, Carla sent her mother expensive gifts, but because of where she lived Sharon was afraid they would be stolen and kept them under lock and key. Rob was later sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for [[armed robbery]] in 2004.\n\nCarla's family also used to know the Kerrigans as they were part of the Connor family. The Kerrigans included [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) who later appeared on the street.\n\n===2006\u20132016===\n{{Long plot|section|date=November 2017}}<!-- Summarize according to reliable sources, please. -->\nCarla arrives and is furious to discover that her husband Paul had spent all the money she needed to start her children's clothing business, though to make more money she manipulated fellow factory workers [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]) and [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) into working weekends, early mornings and late nights in order to raise money for her business. However, Kelly and Joanne eventually refuse to continue working for Carla as they became isolated from their friends and lack in freedom. Carla begins dating catalogue boss [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]). Carla and Tony's relationship makes Liam jealous. During an argument, they kiss, confusing them both. Carla tries to stop Liam marrying [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), so the two women feud. She ends things with Tony by admitting her feelings for Liam; however, Liam marries Maria so she and Tony reconcile; Tony proposes and Carla accepts. In May 2008, Carla supports Liam through the [[stillbirth]] of his and Maria's son, and the two sleep together. Carla's personal assistant, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), records the pair kissing on her mobile phone. Carla threatens Rosie to dispose of the evidence. In June 2008, Carla blackmails Liam into selling his share of the factory to Tony by threatening to tell Maria about their [[one-night stand]]. In September, she invests in [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom Kerrigan]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) and Liam's new T-shirt business, but they agree to keep this from Tony and Maria. Tony discovers the one-night stand after viewing Rosie's video footage. Carla sleeps with Liam again prior to her wedding to Tony, and is prepared to cancel the wedding. However, she changes her mind upon discovering that Maria is pregnant. Carla is devastated by Liam's death in a [[hit-and-run]] incident orchestrated by Tony. Needing to get away, Carla postpones the wedding and goes to [[Los Angeles]]. She returns married to Tony. Tony later confesses to Carla for being responsible for Liam's death and a horrified Carla flees to Los Angeles.\n\nWhen Carla returns, she is contacted by the police after Tony confesses. Carla is attacked by thugs which break into her home. Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), Tony's cellmate, is released from prison and Tony fakes a heart attack to get out of prison. Robbie bails him out of the ambulance and they go to Weatherfield, intending to kill Carla. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with him and holds her at gunpoint. After forcing her to evacuate the building, he leaves her bound and gagged in her office while he lures Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) to the factory, who he also holds hostage. Tony appears, removes the silver duct tape from Carla's mouth, and shoots Robbie dead. He intends to burn the factory to the ground to kill Carla and Hayley, but Maria interrupts and he refuses to let her leave. Carla orders Maria to leave; she escapes. Carla manages to convince Tony to free Hayley. Tony later sets the factory on fire with petrol, whereby Carla manages to untie herself and after a struggle, she shoots Tony in the arm. She manages to flee the burning factory, however, Tony is killed when the building explodes.\n\nCarla returns to Weatherfield and is shocked when her business partner, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), sets up a rival factory underneath the viaduct, and refuses to work with her, but before long, ''Underworld'' is eventually repaired. Carla later invites her boyfriend, [[Trevor Dean]] (Steve Jackson) to become a trainee manager in the factory, much to Nick's annoyance. Trevor finds working in the office difficult, however, and punches Nick as Carla watches on. Nick decides to leave the factory and demands that Carla buys his shares back which cost \u00a3150,000, while Trevor leaves her to reunite with [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]). Carla begins drinking heavily, and is stopped by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) getting into her car. Peter decides to support her as he is also a recovering alcoholic and understands her. After being arrested for drink-driving and being collected from the police station by Peter, Carla confesses her feelings for him. Although he admits he is attracted to her, he remains faithful to [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), his girlfriend. When Nick decides to set up a wine bar on Viaduct Street, he pressures Carla into giving him the money for his share, and she eventually remortgages her flat to get the money. Michelle later gives Carla a new idea for a product she could create in the factory. When Carla's buyer loves the idea, Carla offers Michelle a job in the office. In July 2011, Carla spends the night with her client [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]).\n\nCarla begins dating Frank, and ignores Maria when she tells her that he [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her. Frank and Carla get engaged, however when meeting his parents [[Anne Foster|Anne]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]) and [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] ([[Paul Clayton (actor)|Paul Clayton]]), she becomes intoxicated, arguing with Frank and Anne. She then gets in her car with Frank and drives off, running over Leanne's mother [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and crashing into Peter's bookies. Frank switches places with Carla, who is unconscious, and lies that he was driving. The night before the wedding, Carla tells Frank she cannot marry him because she is in love with Peter, so Frank angrily [[rape]]s Carla. She rings Maria, who phones the police and Frank is arrested. He is released on bail, providing that he does not approach Carla or the factory. He threatens Carla, trying to make her drop the charges but she refuses, so he plans to ruin ''Underworld''. Carla struggles to cope and becomes more dependent on alcohol, attending meetings with Peter; they begin an affair. She [[Attempted suicide|attempts to commit suicide]] by overdosing on pills, but phones Peter, who then phones an ambulance. Carla survives and agrees to begin counselling. Carla is stunned when Stella confesses that she too was raped when she was younger, and reveals that she has never told anyone about her assault. Carla's erratic behaviour at the factory, however, quickly causes many of her clients to withdraw their orders and soon her employees find themselves with no work. As the business starts to haemorrhage money, Carla is forced to sack [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]). While Becky and Eileen understand, Sally is livid and demands a reason. Carla explains that Sally, unlike many of the other workers, is in a comfortable financial situation due to her ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster]]'s ([[Michael Le Vell]]), large lottery win. Frank outwits Carla by employing Sally as a supervisor at his own factory. The factory is nearly bankrupted and Carla is unable to pay any due wages, causing the entire workforce to go on strike, with some defecting to Frank's factory. As Carla reaches the depths of her despair, Michelle returns and sends Carla away on holiday.\n\nIn December 2011, Peter starts drinking again. Carla goes to Peter's flat after hearing from [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) that he has taken a bottle of vodka. Peter tries to kiss Carla several times, but although she loves him, she reluctantly pulls away because of Leanne. Peter goes to leave, however, stays and sleeps with Carla, promising to leave Leanne for him. Carla spends the night and next day with Peter before he goes back to tell Leanne that their marriage is over. However, he does not, which leads to Carla feeling rejected. He is persistent and they eventually meet at Carla's flat, where they decide to reignite their affair until Peter is ready to tell Leanne. They later decide to do this after Frank's trial, since Frank was claiming as part of his defence that Carla and Peter were having an affair and plotting to falsely accuse him of rape to get rid of him. Peter and Carla are almost caught on several occasions, and Frank decides to hire a [[private investigator]] to follow Peter in the hope of catching him with Carla. The weekend before the trial, Peter arranges for them to go to a hotel in [[Chester]], where the investigator takes pictures of them kissing outside. Peter is forced to confess to the affair when Anne, Frank's mother, hands over the photographs to Leanne in the public gallery. He comforts Carla briefly, before finding Leanne. The next day, he tells Carla, before she gives evidence against Frank, that he has left Leanne for her. Afterwards, Peter finds himself attempting to cope with his son [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]), who, devastated over Leanne's departure, blames Carla and begins misbehaving for them. Carla overhears many people gossiping about her, and Stella bars her and Peter from [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].\n\nFrank offers Carla \u00a350,000 to buy her share of ''Underworld''; she initially refuses but eventually accepts when Frank's \"lawyer\" [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Jenny Summer|Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) offers to double his money - Jenny is secretly Frank's girlfriend, and part of Frank's plan to [[Confidence trick|con]] Carla. Carla is furious when Frank reveals his plan; it is already too late as she has signed the forms. Frank soon makes himself an endless list of enemies, and Carla goes to confront him at ''Underworld'', where he admits he raped her and taunts her that he overpowered her easily. Later that night, Frank is found dead in the factory by [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) and [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]), with Sally kneeling beside him with her hands covered in blood. Several residents are in the frame for Frank's murder, including Carla, Peter, Michelle, Sally and Kevin. The whiskey bottle used to kill Frank is found by [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]), and he hands it to the police. Carla's fingerprints are on the bottle and she is arrested for murder but is later released without charge. Peter confesses to Frank's murder to protect Carla, but he is eliminated when a colleague of Peter's reveals that he was at his house when Frank died. It is eventually proven that Frank raped Carla when Sally reveals that he confessed it to her. Anne attacks Carla and accuses her of stealing the contract, when it was, in fact, Michelle, and Anne is warned to stay away from Carla. The police continue with their investigation, and it is revealed that Anne murdered Frank after she overheard him taunting Carla about getting away with raping her. Anne threatens Carla with a knife, before breaking down in tears and being arrested. In April 2012, Carla is informed by Frank's solicitor that Frank has left her his 40% share of the factory to her in his will, changing it when they were engaged and never changing it back; making her the sole owner of ''Underworld''.\n\nCarla supports Peter as he begins a custody battle against Leanne for Simon; he loses in June 2012 and Leanne wins custody. As a result, Peter begins drinking again, splitting up with Carla after a drunken row. Meanwhile, Carla's brother Rob arrives after being released from prison and begins helping her run ''Underworld''. Carla later decides to run away with Peter after he takes Simon without Leanne's consent, however, she can see that Simon would rather be with Leanne, so Peter and Carla then leave without Simon. Carla and Peter return December 2012, just as Leanne is due to fly to [[Las Vegas]] to marry Nick. Peter is thrilled to see Simon but after Carla and Leanne get into a physical fight outside the factory, Carla admits she is struggling with being back in Weatherfield; they agree to leave again. However, Peter later admits that he cannot leave Simon again, so Carla leaves for Los Angeles alone. Carla later surprises Peter by returning on Christmas Eve, saying she could not be without him, unaware that Peter has declared his love for Leanne. Carla is furious to learn that Rob has been altering the accounts for the factory. She sacks him and he sets up his own business, stealing Carla's clients and orders. Realising that she cannot beat Rob's tricks to win over her clients, she reluctantly offers him a share of the factory. However, Carla puts him in charge of packing, angering Rob. He gives his ex girlfriend, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), a job in packing and she convinces him to pretend the van has been robbed whilst transporting expensive material, which they secretly sell on to another company. What Rob and Tracy are unaware of, however, is that Carla knows what they have done and asks a friend to claim to be interested in buying the material. An agreement is reached and Rob takes the material to the chosen location, only to be greeted by Carla and Peter. Tracy is sacked and Rob is forced to sell his share to Carla in return for her not going to the police. Peter's bookies begins to struggle financially. Carla is initially unaware of this, until Michelle tells her about Peter offering risky odds that could potentially bankrupt him. Peter accepts a large bet from Rob, including one that Peter cannot pay when Rob wins. This forces Peter to close his shop and allow Rob and Tracy to set up their own business. Carla gives Peter a share in the factory and he works in the office with her and Michelle, however, this angers Michelle, so she quits.\n\nCarla accompanies Hayley to the hospital for a scan, where she is diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. Throughout Hayley's illness, she confides in Carla, who becomes protective of her. Carla and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) find Hayley deceased on her bed with her husband, [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]). Carla then supports Roy as he grieves for Hayley, and is shocked to learn that Hayley committed suicide. Roy and Carla subsequently become good friends. Carla and Peter hire [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) as a babysitter for Simon. Carla and Peter get married in December 2013, just as Rob discovers that Peter is having an affair with Tina. Tina tries to persuade Peter to leave Weatherfield with her. He agrees, although he feels conflicted, wanting to remain with Weatherfield with Carla. During an argument with Rob and Tracy in The Rovers, Carla announces that she is pregnant just as Tina arrives to collect Peter. Tina storms out, swiftly followed by Peter. They have an almighty argument, ending in Tina scratching Peter across his face. Peter leaves, as Rob visits Tina and attacks her, telling her not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter. Unknown to Rob, Peter tells Carla about the affair. Tina tries to escape Rob, leading to the balcony of the building yard. A scuffle ensues and as Rob pushes Tina; she loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob thinks Tina is dead and leaves the flat, before hearing Tina's groans and realises she is still alive. When Tina reveals that she will lie to the police that Rob intentionally tried to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and brutally beats Tina. Meanwhile, Carla is furious about Peter's affair and storms out into a busy pub, shouting that she wants to \"kill\" Tina. She is restrained by Michelle but eventually leaves the pub. Carla goes to Tina's flat and finds her seriously injured at the bottom of the balcony, and is seen by Leanne and [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]), and soon finds herself prime suspect. She is arrested due to her fingerprints being on the weapon but later released without charge. At first, it is an assault investigation, but when Tina later dies from her injuries in hospital, it turns into a murder investigation. Carla confides in Roy repeatedly and slaps Peter when he tries to talk to her. Her stress finally catches up with her and she collapses in the street when Rob and Peter are fighting. She is rushed to the hospital, where she is told that she has suffered a [[miscarriage]]. Carla struggles to cope with her miscarriage and gets drunk to drown her sorrows. When Rob confesses to Tina's murder to Carla, she fights with him and ultimately chooses to tell the police; Rob is arrested and charged with Tina's murder. From this, Carla begins an intense feud with Tracy.\n\nIn January 2015, Carla and her staff are involved in a minibus crash while on their way to collect a fashion award. When the minibus crashes, Carla becomes wedged in between the driver's seat and the passenger seat. Tracy notices Carla is still trapped inside and climbs into the wreckage to retrieve her. Carla has a broken leg from the accident and thanks Tracy for saving her. After hearing that [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) is selling her share of The Rovers, Carla offers to buy her half so that Michelle and Steve would still be able to live and work there. However, nobody is aware that Tracy and Liz's partner, [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), whom Tracy is having an affair with, are attempting to con Liz, Steve and Michelle out of the pub so that they can buy it. On the day of Steve and Michelle's wedding day in May 2015, Liz confides in Carla, revealing that Tony and Tracy's affair, and that they were conning her out of The Rovers. Carla offers to look after Tracy's daughter and Liz's granddaughter, [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] ([[Elle Mulvaney]]) for the night, and confronts Tracy in the pub toilets, where Carla gives Tracy some harsh home truths. Later that night, Tracy steals the keys to Carla's flat at Victoria Court and lights a candle. She places the candle under a lampshade, and after spotting Carla asleep on the sofa, she contemplates killing her with a large ornament. After hearing Amy, Tracy quickly leaves, unaware that the lampshade has caught fire from the lit candle. When the fire is raging through the flat, Carla collapses from smoke inhalation and desperately tries to call Amy. Leanne breaks into the flat and pulls Carla out of the building. After she gets her breath back, Carla reveals that Amy is still trapped inside, so Leanne and Kal run back in to save her. Kal saves Leanne and Amy, before Carla and the other residents watch in horror as the building explodes, killing Kal. Factory worker [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]) is also caught up in the explosion and is also killed. As Carla was asleep when she started the fire, Tracy tells the residents that it was Carla who started the fire, leading to Leanne shouting at her in the street and everybody else hating her.\n\nCarla plays a game of poker and wins a large amount of money. This subsequently leads to Carla developing [[Problem gambling|an addiction to gambling]], as it eases her guilt from the fire. Carla decides to go on holiday to Madrid. Carla returns a number of weeks later, and it is revealed that she actually went on holiday to Las Vegas in order to gamble. Michelle is furious and after trying to help her, Carla throws her out. Nick later accompanies Carla to a casino and is stunned to learn how serious her addiction is. Realising the extent of her financial troubles, Carla decides to move away and later tries selling the factory to Sally and Kal's daughter [[Alya Nazir]] ([[Sair Khan]]). However, before any contracts are signed, her old friend, Aidan, arrives. Carla decides to go into partnership with Aidan, while also starting a relationship with Nick. Carla becomes suspicious of Tracy, and when Tracy tells her not to keep blaming herself, Carla orders her to get in her car. To Tracy's surprise, Carla takes her to where the minibus crash occurred earlier in the year and expresses that she wishes Tracy had left her to die in the wreckage. She then flips a coin to decide her fate as she drunkenly stands on the edge of the quarry; heads she stands or tails she falls. It lands on tails, so as Carla prepares to throw herself from the cliff, Tracy screams that she was the culprit who started the fire. Carla refuses to believe her, but when Tracy tells her that she saw a photograph of Rob when she lit the candle, Carla realises that she is telling the truth. In pure anger, Carla grabs Tracy and drags her to the edge of the quarry, but Tracy pushes Carla over. Tracy pleads with Carla not to tell anybody, however, Carla is intent on phoning the police and opening an investigation to clear her name, but Tracy says she will deny everything. When Tracy tells Carla that her motive towards the fire was that she was jealous of her and that she still wishes Carla had died in the fire, Carla drives back to the street and the police arrest Tracy. However, Tracy is later released without charge.\n\nNick proposes to Carla and she is shocked to learn that Aidan used his father, Johnny's money to buy into the factory, and thus Johnny and Aidan's sister Kate move to Weatherfield and begin working there. While in prison, Rob begins sending Johnny visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be Carla's father. Johnny steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, and heads for a casino where she bumps into [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), and after gambling with him, they have sex. She instantly regrets it and confides in Michelle, who persuades Carla not to tell Nick. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their one-night stand if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit a secret. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, however after he persuades her, she changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the Bistro to confront him. As a power cut has forced the restaurant to close early, Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Unbeknown to the pair, but Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows in alcohol. However, [[Jamie Bowman]] (James Atherton), and his friend burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla, pinning her down on the floor. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase, jumping into the van, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the van drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious.\n\nMonths later, Tracy begins blackmailing Carla, threatening to tell Nick about her and Robert if she does not persuade Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert and leave Weatherfield. Robert and Leanne both put in matching offers for the Bistro, so Tracy demands \u00a310,000 from Carla. Carla convinces Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert; he does, but Tracy continues taunting Carla. Closer to the wedding, Robert finds out what Tracy has been doing to Carla but they stay together. Nick and Carla break up when he feels guilty after throwing a mug at Carla, causing her to cut her face. They get back together when she supports him. On the wedding day, Tracy tries to ruin proceedings by sending the flowers to the wrong address. Carla feels guilty, so she tells Nick about the one-night stand with Robert; he manages to forgive her. Tracy then announces that she has been blackmailing Carla, which Nick finds more difficult to accept. They eventually marry but Nick instantly regrets it, leaving the venue and Carla in tears. Carla asks Roy to get his car so that she can flee Weatherfield. However, she instead gets in her own car. In front of her, Tracy taunts her and Carla speeds up her car to run Tracy over. Tracy moves but a truck drove by [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) and his girlfriend [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) comes into her path and she swerves, knocking over Roy's partner, [[Cathy Matthews]] ([[Melanie Hill]]) before crashing into the postbox. Carla escapes unharmed, but Cathy lies on the ground motionless. Tyrone crashes into the Platt household, but he and Fiz also escape unharmed, with the help from Nick's half-brother [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]). Roy goes with Cathy to the hospital and as he is Carla, who is being held back by police, tries to apologise for what she has done. The next day, Carla decides to leave for [[Devon]] even though the car crashes are pending investigation. Before leaving, she visits the hospital to see Cathy. Cathy forgives her but Roy finds it more difficult to. She tells Roy she is leaving, but Cathy insists that he reconciles with Carla, however, he declares, \"Carla is who she is, and will never change\". Carla then says an emotional farewell to Johnny, Michelle, Aidan, and Kate. Tracy walks out of her florists and Carla declares, \"We're done\". She then gets in Johnny's car to depart. However, a bus comes and Roy dashes over. Johnny stops the car, with Roy and Carla sharing a final farewell. He forgives her for running over Cathy but tells her she should try to love herself. Carla then kisses Roy on the cheek before getting back in the car and leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Devon.\n\n===2017\u2013===\nOver a year later, Carla meets Aidan in a pub after he calls for her help in saving Underworld. However, she refuses and leaves, stating that she has a new life now. She returns on Christmas Day, with a great response from her family and Michelle. Carla refuses to drink during the day which is picked up upon numerous times. While visiting she says that she will become a partner in Underworld with Aidan. She later bumps into Tracy who calls her a goblin to which Carla replies, \"just think of me as a Ghost of Christmas Past\".  It is declared that she must be up to something when she is seen pouring a drink down the sink in the bathroom as everyone in the pub is singing. Carla invites Roy to join her and the family for New Year's Eve in the Rover's Return.  Roy wants Carla to tell her family about her [[kidney failure]]\u2014she has only shared with him her need for a kidney transplant.  Roy has agreed to keep quiet about her condition but says she needs support and must tell them. Carla struggles with her illness and as everyone welcomes in the New Year, she breaks down; Roy witnesses this and asks her to move in with him. She agrees and goes back inside while Roy searches online \"how to donate a kidney\", unbeknownst to Carla. Carla also grows close to [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]), Peter and Tracy\u2019s half-brother, upon her return. She clashes with Peter's new partner, [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who sees her as a threat. Carla, however, refuses to tell her family about her illness, despite numerous advice from Roy. She later collapses in the street and is found by [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn]]) and is rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, Roy tells her that he was tested for a kidney match but was not successful, which touched Carla. She decides to listen to him and upon hearing that her situation is getting more critical, she tells Kate and Aidan who both tell her that they will get tested.\n\nOn the day that Aidan and Kate get tested, Carla meets Daniel and they go round to his flat. After they establish a certain spark between them both, they have sex. Afterwards, they leave the flat and kiss on the doorstep which Daniel's ex-girlfriend, [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) witnesses whilst going round to get back with Daniel as he had earlier given her a present. They later meet up for a drink later on in the Rovers Return, whom Peter is now landlord of with Toyah. Peter tells Carla that he saw them together earlier and it is obvious that Peter is jealous. Whilst there, she meets Aidan who tells her that he has been tested. Peter also talks with Daniel and pesters about what was going on that afternoon. However, Sinead's aunt [[Beth Tinker|Beth Sutherland]] ([[Lisa George]]) storms into the pub and argues with Carla about their kiss on the doorstep which everybody hears including Peter who sarcastically comments - \"you make a great couple\". The next day, Peter taunts Carla about Daniel suggesting that she is only doing it to get back at him. Carla disagrees by saying, \"don\u2019t flatter yourself\" and says sarcastically that Toyah is lucky, clearly because he is jealous of Carla. She later meets Daniel again and they go on a date where she orders a bottle of wine - her first alcoholic drink in a while. Aidan and Kate disapprove but she goes ahead and drinks anyway before collapsing which is met by an audience of Tracy who also teases her about Daniel. Carla and Daniel later meet again in the Rovers as both Aidan and Kate find out they are donor matches. After being refused a drink by Peter and Toyah after stumbling to the bar, Carla collapses again as Roy reveals that she has kidney failure to all her family, Peter, Daniel, and Toyah. Peter worries about her as she is taken to hospital with disapproval from Toyah. Tracey later finds out and is taken aback as she too has had kidney failure. At the hospital, Aidan agrees to donate his kidney as Carla\u2019s situation becomes even more critical with the doctors saying that she needs a new kidney quick. Aidan is praised by the rest of the family and Carla who thanks him. The next day, Peter visits her in the hospital and brings her a book where Daniel already is. Once again, Peter shows jealousy but he and Carla appear to get on with Peter saying that he still cares.\n\nAfter realising that she might die, Carla tells Sinead that Daniel still likes her and that she doesn\u2019t want her last moments to be stealing somebody else\u2019s man. Aidan later has his operation and Carla has a kidney transplant - which are both successful. Afterward, Carla tells Roy that she is renting out her house in Devon and moving back to Weatherfield for good, much to his delight. Carla later sleeps with Michelle\u2019s biological son [[Alex Neeson|Ali Neeson]] (James Burrows) who was swapped at birth and won\u2019t speak to his mother, after Carla tries to make amends between them. She hides this from Michelle. Carla later gives Aidan 100% of Underworld on his birthday, to which he responds nervously, which leads to Johnny suspecting that he is hiding something. Carla later discovers that Robert, who is now engaged to Michelle, is using [[steroids]]. She agrees to not tell Michelle but confides in Ali about it as he is a [[general practitioner|GP]]. After asking how Ali is dealing with the situation, Ali tries to kiss Carla and although she refuses at first, they share a more passionate kiss as Michelle walks out on them both. Michelle is extremely angry at Carla and they fall out. Carla then tells Ali that her friendship with Michelle will come first and won\u2019t let him stay the night at Roy\u2019s.\n\nCarla is left distraught when Aidan commits [[suicide]] but manages to stay strong and support her family. The day after his death, she reopens the factory which shocks the employees as it is so soon after his death. She continues to run it until Michelle finds Aidan\u2019s will, which reveals he has left it to Alya Nazir, whom Carla doesn\u2019t get on with and would hate for her to own the factory. Michelle and Carla seek legal advice as the will was written before Carla gave 100% of the factory to Aidan and keep it a secret from Alya. In the coming weeks, tension arises between Alya and Carla. She is told that she will have to say that Aidan was mentally unstable when he wrote his will and she later lashes out at Alya causing her to quit her job at Underworld before Carla breaks down and locks herself in her office. She tells Michelle that she feels responsible for Aidan\u2019s suicide as she put pressure on him when giving him the factory. Unknown to Carla, Alya is later given Aidan\u2019s will which shows that she is the sole owner of Underworld. Alya and her lawyer [[Imran Habeeb]] (Charlie de Melo) tell the Connors that she knows and Johnny finds out about Aidan\u2019s will, telling Carla that he will disown her if she contests it. On the day of Aidan\u2019s funeral, Carla contemplates drinking. Before the service, Alya appears and Carla threatens her. Carla is later furious when Alya changes Underworld\u2019s locks on the same day and storms over to Alya. After calming down, Carla tells her that she can have the 18% as it is what she would\u2019ve had anyway. Despite this, Alya refuses and Carla tells her that she\u2019ll see her in court.\n\nCarla later asks Beth Tinker to get inside information about Underworld in exchange for a rent-free flat. She also gets Peter involved and they go on several dates. He helps the Connor family as they fight [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) for custody of [[Susie Price (Coronation Street)|Susie Price]], as he previously believed this was his child. On the day before the mediation, he brings around a birth certificate to prove Eva lied about her parents. Carla is, however, sceptical about showing this as it would get Eva into a lot of trouble. Johnny later kidnaps Susie and Carla supports him. She shouts at Eva in the street when Johnny is arrested. Johnny is, however, later released, and the Connors forgive Eva when she leaves. A week later, Peter tells Carla that he thinks there\u2019s still a flame between them but she shouts at him and tells him that he\u2019s stupid.  Alya later tells Carla that she is selling the factory in order to fund her family\u2019s restaurant. Initially, it is for 18% less than the price but Alya later puts it up. Alya also gives Carla a video of Aidan doing an interview about being a kidney donor. Carla struggles with finding money for the factory but Peter rescues her by becoming her partner. Carla later breaks down over Aidan\u2019s death saying that she blames herself but Johnny reassures her and later on Carla and Peter meet and end up kissing. The next day, they talk about the kiss and both say it didn\u2019t mean anything, although the factory girls and her family are sceptical about Peter\u2019s motive for helping Carla. Peter later tells Carla that he doesn\u2019t want to be a sleeping partner and that he is to work full time at the factory, shocking her. A few weeks later, Carla and Peter interview new staff for the factory and Carla brings in someone who looks like Tina, to catch Peter out. However, he realises and she is shocked that he doesn\u2019t want to employ her. This makes Carla realise that she might actually have feelings for him as he appears to have changed. The next day, after trying to protect Simon from a gang, she witnesses Peter shot and fears that he has died. Luckily, it was only a paint gun but she realises she has feelings for him and confesses to Michelle and is met with a cold response. A few months later, Nick returns and Carla\u2019s feelings for Peter grow stronger. However, she finds out that he is planning to sell his share of the factory although manages to stall him. Unknown to her, Peter finds an application to buy his share from a while back, addressed to Carla and sells his share to Nick, shocking Carla when she is about to tell him about her feelings. At first, they struggle to work together but manage as Nick tells a lie to Carla about what he has been up to. Carla, however, knows it\u2019s a lie and after doing some digging finds out that he has a wife, who spots her rummaging through his car. She later confronts her and they talk about Nick. Carla later meets with Nick and blackmails him, telling him that he either sells his share over to her or she tells his wife, [[Elsa Tilsley|Elsa]] ([[Kelly Harrison]]) and Leanne, who is now seeing, about the marriage and his relationship.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2018, Carla shares a game of snooker with Peter and they share a heart to heart, with them both confessing their love with each other. Carla is later upset when she sees [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]) and Peter together, which he notices. Later on, he asks her about this as he can see her jealousy, although Carla rejects him when he tries to kiss her. Carla later comforts Peter when the boat sets on fire and Simon is trapped on board. Unknown to both Carla and Peter, Roy accidentally set the boat alight whilst sleepwalking, something which Carla is helping him cope with. Peter blames Abi as he broke up with her earlier in the day. She later finds out that it was Roy because of CCTV footage in the factory, although she lets Abi take the blame and destroys all evidence that Roy started it without telling him. However, Abi is later given an alibi and everyone starts to accuse Carla of starting it, including Peter, out of jealousy. Roy, however, later finds his clothes and Carla is forced to tell him the truth. He is devastated and tells Peter, who agrees to not pursue the matter further. Roy insists on going to the police but argues furiously with Carla telling her that she didn\u2019t cover up the fire to protect him and instead did it out of jealousy, wanting Abi locked up as she is still in love with Peter, leaving Carla in tears. The following day, Roy tells Carla that she should find somewhere else to live. A week later, Carla ignores the fact the roof of the factory needs replacing and tells [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) that she can\u2019t afford it. She instead focuses on starting a new business contract where workers and material would be supplied from abroad. Carla is later threatened by Robert, following his breakup with Michelle, as he is looking for someone to blame. Nick later finds out about her plans for outsourcing and Carla admits to her employees that she is planning to move production to [[Milton Keynes]] which they take badly. They go on strike and Nick swears revenge on Carla as he needs money. Peter tries to help but she tells him to back off and Gary also pesters her for repair money. She later sees that her car window has been smashed, to which Robert tells her it could be anyone as she now has a lot of enemies.\n\nThe next day, Kate is due to marry [[Rana Habeeb]] ([[Bhavna Limbachia]]) but Carla finds out that Peter is leaving and manages to track him down. She breaks down in front of him and tells him she loves him and wants them to be together, but he tells her that although he loves her, she will \"kill him\" and he leaves anyway, leaving Carla distraught. Unknown to her, the workers have broken into Underworld in a protest. However, the factory roof collapses, leaving residents such as Sally, Rana, Sean, [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]), [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Paul Foreman|Paul Foreman]] ([[Peter Ash]]), [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell) unconscious and injured. Carla later drowns her sorrows in a pub, but realises she should be at Kate's wedding. However, upon arriving on the street she finds out about the collapse and that Rana is trapped inside after going to fetch her bag. Peter arrives to comfort Carla as he finds out about the collapse and Carla breaks down to him, insisting it was her fault, as they find out that Rana has died in the incident. Carla initially wants to tell the police the truth as they want to interview her but Peter bribes Gary with \u00a310,000 to keep quiet and they say that neither of them knew that the roof needed repairing. Carla is suspicious of the health and safety inspector and Roy\u2019s previous foster son [[Wayne Hayes (Coronation Street)|Wayne Hayes]] (Adam Barlow) and leaves for a short break with Peter after he says he loves her and will be there. A week later the pair return and Carla is arrested at Rana\u2019s memorial for manslaughter and the residents start to blame her for Rana\u2019s death, including Kate. Upon being released from police custody, Carla visits Aidan\u2019s grave where she is verbally attacked and starts receiving text messages from an anonymous person pretending to be Rana telling her the roof collapse was \"her fault\". Later on Carla rings the phone number believing it to actually be Rana and that she is still alive, showing that her mental health is deteriorating. She later finds out that it is Alya sending the messages as Kate tells her, although she starts believing everybody is plotting against her and starts hearing voices. The next day, she starts feeling trapped and [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) tries to help, aware of her paranoia. She runs outside barefoot and bumps into the police and Alya, who she believes has been sent to spy on her. Peter manages to find her and takes her to the medical centre where Carla tries to find Rana, whom she believes is still alive. Toyah attempts to help her but she escapes through the window when Toyah leaves to try and get professional mental health support.\n\nPeter begins to look for her and manages to get Johnny to help him. He reports her missing to the police but refuses to believe they will help and possibly arrest her when she is found. He posts an image of her online and gets a reply from a man at a squat on her old estate, which he follows up and comes to nothing. The police later tell him that she was seen drawing money out of a cash machine and returning to the squat. He goes back with Johnny and threatens the man, who makes it clear that she isn\u2019t there. Peter and Johnny leave as Carla watches from the window. She is told to find somewhere else to go as Peter causes trouble. She acknowledges this as not being safe \"from Peter\". Robert later finds Carla in a hotel in town when the staff shout \"Mrs. Donovan\" and she panics upon seeing him. However, he later catches up with her and tries to calm her down saying he is there for her and attempts to bring her back to the street. Upon returning, she runs away as Robert tries to find her, he is stalled by a man who punches him, thinking Carla is threatened. Robert later tells the family and they run into the street shouting her, as she hides behind a wall. Throughout the search, they find that Carla has been living in a hotel room, which she has ultimately destroyed. They also find she hasn\u2019t been taking medication for her kidney failure and may go into rejection. As the police start taking their search for her more serious, Carla panics and goes to Roy, whom she believes she can trust. However, when he rings her family to notify them that he has found her, she lashes out at Roy. An ambulance arrives as Carla breaks down. The doctor tells Roy and Johnny that her kidneys are fine but she demands to see Peter, who unknown to her, has been in rehab after a relapse. Peter visits and comforts her as she is psychologically assessed and is told she is to be discharged the following day but will need to be assessed every day and Roy lets her and Peter stay with him.

It was revealed that it would become apparent that Carla is being targeted. Producer Iain MacLeod explained that the collapse \"will trigger a massive story for Carla because it impacts massively on her mental health\" and that she feels \"correctly that everybody is out to get her and she spirals off into a slightly delusional state\". It was also confirmed that Carla would get a stand-alone episode, which has been compared to MacLeod's production at ''[[Emmerdale]]'', in which he created an episode focused around [[Ashley Thomas]]' ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) [[Vascular dementia|dementia]]. Commenting on this, MacLeod has added, \"We're doing something a little bit stylised, like the Ashley story I did at ''Emmerdale'', but it won't be quite as extreme as that. It's a stand-alone episode that will be both mental health-focused and Carla focused. It will also be the reveal to the audience of who is behind the factory roof collapsing. I'd hesitate to put a diagnosis on what it is affecting Carla, but the factory collapse has lots of unexpected offshoots into areas that give our amazing cast a chance to show off their acting chops.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tone of the episode, MacLeod added: \"We're inside Carla's head, but I'm still unsure about how far we explore what's real and what's not real.\" In the run-up to the factory disaster, a determined Carla will be seen ploughing all her energies into making the business a market leader, but this ends up having fatal consequences for her workforce: \"It comes from a workaholicism story for Carla. She makes the decision that her life's priority is her work. She wants to turn the factory into a world-beating business. But that leads to her making mistakes in both her personal and professional life. She ends up getting on the wrong side of a lot of people. And by the time of the collapse, many of them will wish her ill.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-12-18/carlas-mental-health-breakdown-to-be-focus-of-special-standalone-coronation-street/amp/ | work = Radio Times | title = Carla's mental health breakdown to be focus of a special episode  | accessdate = 18 December 2018}}</ref> A trailer of the storyline, which shows Carla breaking down, was released on 11 March 2019.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nColumnist [[Grace Dent]] has described Carla as \"...an alluring vision, raven haired, classy, sultry and replete with guile\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/26/television.culture |title=Grace Dent's world of lather &#124; Media |work=The Guardian|date= 26 January 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The episode aired on 3 December 2008, in which Carla married Tony Gordon attracted an impressive peak of 10.5 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/04/tvratings-coronationstreet |title=TV ratings \u2013 3 December: More than 10 million viewers watch Coronation Street wedding &#124; Media |work=The Guardian|date= 4 December 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, the character was heralded as the new [[Elsie Tanner]]: \"strong, dark, mouthy, pushy, full of herself and nobody's fool, ready to put the world to rights with another lashing of lipstick.

He made the point that while it was being treated with more sensitivity than the rape of [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) was, back in 2001, the impression was that the writing team were placing too much pain and anguish upon Carla's character: \"By having Carla undergo a vicious violation like rape, it begins to feel that she's being systematically targeted by the storyliners. There's no denying that the scenes in this evening's double bill are powerfully acted by Alison King, but there seems to be an underlying mission to crack open Carla's carapace and expose her vulnerability. In the wider world, rapists often choose their targets regardless of the victim's circumstance, so there's no saying that Carla wouldn\u2019t suffer an assault of this sort. But, in a fictional setting, it does begin to look cruel when so much anguish is piled onto one person's shoulders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla's-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |title=Is Carla's rape an ordeal too far? |publisher=Radio Times Blog |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924031529/http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla%27s-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |archivedate=24 September 2011  }}</ref>\n\nSarah Ellis of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that Carla was great to watch when she is with Peter.

Although King is not on [[social media]] herself, many fan base accounts have been set up on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]]. The character is also amongst many discussions on ''Twitter'' and often finds herself 'trending' after an episode. Examples of the fans' involvement are such things as when she left in 2016, many people were calling for her return straight after the episode. In 2018 also, when Carla began her feud with Alya Nazir, ''Coronation Street'' put out [[hashtags]] with either #TeamAlya or #TeamCarla. Over 1,000 people responded with #TeamCarla and this yet again became a discussion on social media, with many fans criticising the character of Alya just because of her attitude towards Carla. Peter and Carla's relationship also has its own nickname by fans, which is Carter. The #Carter hashtag has been used numerous times since her 2017 return.\n\n===Accolades===\nIn an online poll conducted by ''MSN Entertainment'', Carla Connor was voted as 'Soapland's Sexiest Female of 2008', with more than 31% of votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525180403/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |archivedate=25 May 2009  }}</ref> At the 2008 ''Inside Soap Awards'', the character was voted \"Best Bitch\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen |first=Liam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7642263.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; EastEnders dominates soap awards |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> King was awarded \"Best Actress\" at [[British Soap Awards#2012 winners|The British Soap Awards 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jim|title=Eastenders wins top prize at British Soap Awards|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/17886011|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=29 April 2012}}</ref> On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, King was nominated for \"Best Female Soap Actor\" and came fifth with 9.7% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders', Corrie, 'Hollyoaks' all win in Digital Spy's 2012 poll|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a446819/eastenders-corrie-hollyoaks-all-win-in-digital-spys-2012-poll.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}</ref> King was nominated for the \"Best Actress\" award at [[The British Soap Awards#2014 winners|The British Soap Awards 2014]], and was nominated for the award again in the [[British Soap Awards#2015 winners|2015 ceremony]].

She was the result of a one-night stand her mother Sharon Donovan had with [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]), a married man who lived near by. Johnny knew that Carla was probably his daughter, but for the sake of his marriage, he put aside the memory of his liaison with Sharon. He did, however, pay child support whenever Sharon was in trouble, which he managed to hide from his wife. Sharon lived in poverty on a run-down council estate. Carla was born into a world of alcohol and drugs, which Sharon sold from Carla's pram. Sharon had plenty of boyfriends and, a few years after Carla was born, she gave birth to her second child, [[Rob Donovan|Rob]] ([[Marc Baylis]]). She went on to marry George, who mistreated Carla and Rob and was hated by them. Carla's best friends growing up were [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) who lived in the nicer part of the estate. Michelle and her siblings were second cousins once removed of Johnny and third cousins of Johnny's children, [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate]] ([[Faye Brookes]]), with whom Carla was also friendly despite them being ten years younger than her. In 1993, Sharon told Lou about her affair with Johnny, leading Lou to run out of the house while arguing with Johnny and was fatally struck by a drunk driver. As a teenager, Carla worked Saturdays in a shoe shop and on her birthday in 1997 she started dating her future husband Paul, whom she married on 26 January 1999. With Paul earning good money, Carla's lifestyle changed for the better. For a while, she visited her family regularly but stopped as Rob constantly got at her for leaving him to deal with their mother's troubles alone. To ease her conscience, Carla sent her mother expensive gifts, but because of where she lived Sharon was afraid they would be stolen and kept them under lock and key. Rob was later sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for [[armed robbery]] in 2004.\n\nCarla's family also used to know the Kerrigans as they were part of the Connor family. The Kerrigans included [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) who later appeared on the street.\n\n===2006\u20132016===\n{{Long plot|section|date=November 2017}}<!-- Summarize according to reliable sources, please. -->\nCarla arrives and is furious to discover that her husband Paul had spent all the money she needed to start her children's clothing business, though to make more money she manipulated fellow factory workers [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]) and [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) into working weekends, early mornings and late nights in order to raise money for her business. However, Kelly and Joanne eventually refuse to continue working for Carla as they became isolated from their friends and lack in freedom. Carla begins dating catalogue boss [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]). Carla and Tony's relationship makes Liam jealous. During an argument, they kiss, confusing them both. Carla tries to stop Liam marrying [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), so the two women feud. She ends things with Tony by admitting her feelings for Liam; however, Liam marries Maria so she and Tony reconcile; Tony proposes and Carla accepts. In May 2008, Carla supports Liam through the [[stillbirth]] of his and Maria's son, and the two sleep together. Carla's personal assistant, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), records the pair kissing on her mobile phone. Carla threatens Rosie to dispose of the evidence. In June 2008, Carla blackmails Liam into selling his share of the factory to Tony by threatening to tell Maria about their [[one-night stand]]. In September, she invests in [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom Kerrigan]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) and Liam's new T-shirt business, but they agree to keep this from Tony and Maria. Tony discovers the one-night stand after viewing Rosie's video footage. Carla sleeps with Liam again prior to her wedding to Tony, and is prepared to cancel the wedding. However, she changes her mind upon discovering that Maria is pregnant. Carla is devastated by Liam's death in a [[hit-and-run]] incident orchestrated by Tony. Needing to get away, Carla postpones the wedding and goes to [[Los Angeles]]. She returns married to Tony. Tony later confesses to Carla for being responsible for Liam's death and a horrified Carla flees to Los Angeles.\n\nWhen Carla returns, she is contacted by the police after Tony confesses. Carla is attacked by thugs which break into her home. Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), Tony's cellmate, is released from prison and Tony fakes a heart attack to get out of prison. Robbie bails him out of the ambulance and they go to Weatherfield, intending to kill Carla. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with him and holds her at gunpoint. After forcing her to evacuate the building, he leaves her bound and gagged in her office while he lures Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) to the factory, who he also holds hostage. Tony appears, removes the silver duct tape from Carla's mouth, and shoots Robbie dead. He intends to burn the factory to the ground to kill Carla and Hayley, but Maria interrupts and he refuses to let her leave. Carla orders Maria to leave; she escapes. Carla manages to convince Tony to free Hayley. Tony later sets the factory on fire with petrol, whereby Carla manages to untie herself and after a struggle, she shoots Tony in the arm. She manages to flee the burning factory, however, Tony is killed when the building explodes.\n\nCarla returns to Weatherfield and is shocked when her business partner, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), sets up a rival factory underneath the viaduct, and refuses to work with her, but before long, ''Underworld'' is eventually repaired. Carla later invites her boyfriend, [[Trevor Dean]] (Steve Jackson) to become a trainee manager in the factory, much to Nick's annoyance. Trevor finds working in the office difficult, however, and punches Nick as Carla watches on. Nick decides to leave the factory and demands that Carla buys his shares back which cost \u00a3150,000, while Trevor leaves her to reunite with [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]). Carla begins drinking heavily, and is stopped by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) getting into her car. Peter decides to support her as he is also a recovering alcoholic and understands her. After being arrested for drink-driving and being collected from the police station by Peter, Carla confesses her feelings for him. Although he admits he is attracted to her, he remains faithful to [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), his girlfriend. When Nick decides to set up a wine bar on Viaduct Street, he pressures Carla into giving him the money for his share, and she eventually remortgages her flat to get the money. Michelle later gives Carla a new idea for a product she could create in the factory. When Carla's buyer loves the idea, Carla offers Michelle a job in the office. In July 2011, Carla spends the night with her client [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]).\n\nCarla begins dating Frank, and ignores Maria when she tells her that he [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her. Frank and Carla get engaged, however when meeting his parents [[Anne Foster|Anne]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]) and [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] ([[Paul Clayton (actor)|Paul Clayton]]), she becomes intoxicated, arguing with Frank and Anne. She then gets in her car with Frank and drives off, running over Leanne's mother [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and crashing into Peter's bookies. Frank switches places with Carla, who is unconscious, and lies that he was driving. The night before the wedding, Carla tells Frank she cannot marry him because she is in love with Peter, so Frank angrily [[rape]]s Carla. She rings Maria, who phones the police and Frank is arrested. He is released on bail, providing that he does not approach Carla or the factory. He threatens Carla, trying to make her drop the charges but she refuses, so he plans to ruin ''Underworld''. Carla struggles to cope and becomes more dependent on alcohol, attending meetings with Peter; they begin an affair. She [[Attempted suicide|attempts to commit suicide]] by overdosing on pills, but phones Peter, who then phones an ambulance. Carla survives and agrees to begin counselling. Carla is stunned when Stella confesses that she too was raped when she was younger, and reveals that she has never told anyone about her assault. Carla's erratic behaviour at the factory, however, quickly causes many of her clients to withdraw their orders and soon her employees find themselves with no work. As the business starts to haemorrhage money, Carla is forced to sack [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]). While Becky and Eileen understand, Sally is livid and demands a reason. Carla explains that Sally, unlike many of the other workers, is in a comfortable financial situation due to her ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster]]'s ([[Michael Le Vell]]), large lottery win. Frank outwits Carla by employing Sally as a supervisor at his own factory. The factory is nearly bankrupted and Carla is unable to pay any due wages, causing the entire workforce to go on strike, with some defecting to Frank's factory. As Carla reaches the depths of her despair, Michelle returns and sends Carla away on holiday.\n\nIn December 2011, Peter starts drinking again. Carla goes to Peter's flat after hearing from [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) that he has taken a bottle of vodka. Peter tries to kiss Carla several times, but although she loves him, she reluctantly pulls away because of Leanne. Peter goes to leave, however, stays and sleeps with Carla, promising to leave Leanne for him. Carla spends the night and next day with Peter before he goes back to tell Leanne that their marriage is over. However, he does not, which leads to Carla feeling rejected. He is persistent and they eventually meet at Carla's flat, where they decide to reignite their affair until Peter is ready to tell Leanne. They later decide to do this after Frank's trial, since Frank was claiming as part of his defence that Carla and Peter were having an affair and plotting to falsely accuse him of rape to get rid of him. Peter and Carla are almost caught on several occasions, and Frank decides to hire a [[private investigator]] to follow Peter in the hope of catching him with Carla. The weekend before the trial, Peter arranges for them to go to a hotel in [[Chester]], where the investigator takes pictures of them kissing outside. Peter is forced to confess to the affair when Anne, Frank's mother, hands over the photographs to Leanne in the public gallery. He comforts Carla briefly, before finding Leanne. The next day, he tells Carla, before she gives evidence against Frank, that he has left Leanne for her. Afterwards, Peter finds himself attempting to cope with his son [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]), who, devastated over Leanne's departure, blames Carla and begins misbehaving for them. Carla overhears many people gossiping about her, and Stella bars her and Peter from [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].\n\nFrank offers Carla \u00a350,000 to buy her share of ''Underworld''; she initially refuses but eventually accepts when Frank's \"lawyer\" [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Jenny Summer|Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) offers to double his money - Jenny is secretly Frank's girlfriend, and part of Frank's plan to [[Confidence trick|con]] Carla. Carla is furious when Frank reveals his plan; it is already too late as she has signed the forms. Frank soon makes himself an endless list of enemies, and Carla goes to confront him at ''Underworld'', where he admits he raped her and taunts her that he overpowered her easily. Later that night, Frank is found dead in the factory by [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) and [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]), with Sally kneeling beside him with her hands covered in blood. Several residents are in the frame for Frank's murder, including Carla, Peter, Michelle, Sally and Kevin. The whiskey bottle used to kill Frank is found by [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]), and he hands it to the police. Carla's fingerprints are on the bottle and she is arrested for murder but is later released without charge. Peter confesses to Frank's murder to protect Carla, but he is eliminated when a colleague of Peter's reveals that he was at his house when Frank died. It is eventually proven that Frank raped Carla when Sally reveals that he confessed it to her. Anne attacks Carla and accuses her of stealing the contract, when it was, in fact, Michelle, and Anne is warned to stay away from Carla. The police continue with their investigation, and it is revealed that Anne murdered Frank after she overheard him taunting Carla about getting away with raping her. Anne threatens Carla with a knife, before breaking down in tears and being arrested. In April 2012, Carla is informed by Frank's solicitor that Frank has left her his 40% share of the factory to her in his will, changing it when they were engaged and never changing it back; making her the sole owner of ''Underworld''.\n\nCarla supports Peter as he begins a custody battle against Leanne for Simon; he loses in June 2012 and Leanne wins custody. As a result, Peter begins drinking again, splitting up with Carla after a drunken row. Meanwhile, Carla's brother Rob arrives after being released from prison and begins helping her run ''Underworld''. Carla later decides to run away with Peter after he takes Simon without Leanne's consent, however, she can see that Simon would rather be with Leanne, so Peter and Carla then leave without Simon. Carla and Peter return December 2012, just as Leanne is due to fly to [[Las Vegas]] to marry Nick. Peter is thrilled to see Simon but after Carla and Leanne get into a physical fight outside the factory, Carla admits she is struggling with being back in Weatherfield; they agree to leave again. However, Peter later admits that he cannot leave Simon again, so Carla leaves for Los Angeles alone. Carla later surprises Peter by returning on Christmas Eve, saying she could not be without him, unaware that Peter has declared his love for Leanne. Carla is furious to learn that Rob has been altering the accounts for the factory. She sacks him and he sets up his own business, stealing Carla's clients and orders. Realising that she cannot beat Rob's tricks to win over her clients, she reluctantly offers him a share of the factory. However, Carla puts him in charge of packing, angering Rob. He gives his ex girlfriend, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), a job in packing and she convinces him to pretend the van has been robbed whilst transporting expensive material, which they secretly sell on to another company. What Rob and Tracy are unaware of, however, is that Carla knows what they have done and asks a friend to claim to be interested in buying the material. An agreement is reached and Rob takes the material to the chosen location, only to be greeted by Carla and Peter. Tracy is sacked and Rob is forced to sell his share to Carla in return for her not going to the police. Peter's bookies begins to struggle financially. Carla is initially unaware of this, until Michelle tells her about Peter offering risky odds that could potentially bankrupt him. Peter accepts a large bet from Rob, including one that Peter cannot pay when Rob wins. This forces Peter to close his shop and allow Rob and Tracy to set up their own business. Carla gives Peter a share in the factory and he works in the office with her and Michelle, however, this angers Michelle, so she quits.\n\nCarla accompanies Hayley to the hospital for a scan, where she is diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. Throughout Hayley's illness, she confides in Carla, who becomes protective of her. Carla and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) find Hayley deceased on her bed with her husband, [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]). Carla then supports Roy as he grieves for Hayley, and is shocked to learn that Hayley committed suicide. Roy and Carla subsequently become good friends. Carla and Peter hire [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) as a babysitter for Simon. Carla and Peter get married in December 2013, just as Rob discovers that Peter is having an affair with Tina. Tina tries to persuade Peter to leave Weatherfield with her. He agrees, although he feels conflicted, wanting to remain with Weatherfield with Carla. During an argument with Rob and Tracy in The Rovers, Carla announces that she is pregnant just as Tina arrives to collect Peter. Tina storms out, swiftly followed by Peter. They have an almighty argument, ending in Tina scratching Peter across his face. Peter leaves, as Rob visits Tina and attacks her, telling her not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter. Unknown to Rob, Peter tells Carla about the affair. Tina tries to escape Rob, leading to the balcony of the building yard. A scuffle ensues and as Rob pushes Tina; she loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob thinks Tina is dead and leaves the flat, before hearing Tina's groans and realises she is still alive. When Tina reveals that she will lie to the police that Rob intentionally tried to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and brutally beats Tina. Meanwhile, Carla is furious about Peter's affair and storms out into a busy pub, shouting that she wants to \"kill\" Tina. She is restrained by Michelle but eventually leaves the pub. Carla goes to Tina's flat and finds her seriously injured at the bottom of the balcony, and is seen by Leanne and [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]), and soon finds herself prime suspect. She is arrested due to her fingerprints being on the weapon but later released without charge. At first, it is an assault investigation, but when Tina later dies from her injuries in hospital, it turns into a murder investigation. Carla confides in Roy repeatedly and slaps Peter when he tries to talk to her. Her stress finally catches up with her and she collapses in the street when Rob and Peter are fighting. She is rushed to the hospital, where she is told that she has suffered a [[miscarriage]]. Carla struggles to cope with her miscarriage and gets drunk to drown her sorrows. When Rob confesses to Tina's murder to Carla, she fights with him and ultimately chooses to tell the police; Rob is arrested and charged with Tina's murder. From this, Carla begins an intense feud with Tracy.\n\nIn January 2015, Carla and her staff are involved in a minibus crash while on their way to collect a fashion award. When the minibus crashes, Carla becomes wedged in between the driver's seat and the passenger seat. Tracy notices Carla is still trapped inside and climbs into the wreckage to retrieve her. Carla has a broken leg from the accident and thanks Tracy for saving her. After hearing that [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) is selling her share of The Rovers, Carla offers to buy her half so that Michelle and Steve would still be able to live and work there. However, nobody is aware that Tracy and Liz's partner, [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), whom Tracy is having an affair with, are attempting to con Liz, Steve and Michelle out of the pub so that they can buy it. On the day of Steve and Michelle's wedding day in May 2015, Liz confides in Carla, revealing that Tony and Tracy's affair, and that they were conning her out of The Rovers. Carla offers to look after Tracy's daughter and Liz's granddaughter, [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] ([[Elle Mulvaney]]) for the night, and confronts Tracy in the pub toilets, where Carla gives Tracy some harsh home truths. Later that night, Tracy steals the keys to Carla's flat at Victoria Court and lights a candle. She places the candle under a lampshade, and after spotting Carla asleep on the sofa, she contemplates killing her with a large ornament. After hearing Amy, Tracy quickly leaves, unaware that the lampshade has caught fire from the lit candle. When the fire is raging through the flat, Carla collapses from smoke inhalation and desperately tries to call Amy. Leanne breaks into the flat and pulls Carla out of the building. After she gets her breath back, Carla reveals that Amy is still trapped inside, so Leanne and Kal run back in to save her. Kal saves Leanne and Amy, before Carla and the other residents watch in horror as the building explodes, killing Kal. Factory worker [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]) is also caught up in the explosion and is also killed. As Carla was asleep when she started the fire, Tracy tells the residents that it was Carla who started the fire, leading to Leanne shouting at her in the street and everybody else hating her.\n\nCarla plays a game of poker and wins a large amount of money. This subsequently leads to Carla developing [[Problem gambling|an addiction to gambling]], as it eases her guilt from the fire. Carla decides to go on holiday to Madrid. Carla returns a number of weeks later, and it is revealed that she actually went on holiday to Las Vegas in order to gamble. Michelle is furious and after trying to help her, Carla throws her out. Nick later accompanies Carla to a casino and is stunned to learn how serious her addiction is. Realising the extent of her financial troubles, Carla decides to move away and later tries selling the factory to Sally and Kal's daughter [[Alya Nazir]] ([[Sair Khan]]). However, before any contracts are signed, her old friend, Aidan, arrives. Carla decides to go into partnership with Aidan, while also starting a relationship with Nick. Carla becomes suspicious of Tracy, and when Tracy tells her not to keep blaming herself, Carla orders her to get in her car. To Tracy's surprise, Carla takes her to where the minibus crash occurred earlier in the year and expresses that she wishes Tracy had left her to die in the wreckage. She then flips a coin to decide her fate as she drunkenly stands on the edge of the quarry; heads she stands or tails she falls. It lands on tails, so as Carla prepares to throw herself from the cliff, Tracy screams that she was the culprit who started the fire. Carla refuses to believe her, but when Tracy tells her that she saw a photograph of Rob when she lit the candle, Carla realises that she is telling the truth. In pure anger, Carla grabs Tracy and drags her to the edge of the quarry, but Tracy pushes Carla over. Tracy pleads with Carla not to tell anybody, however, Carla is intent on phoning the police and opening an investigation to clear her name, but Tracy says she will deny everything. When Tracy tells Carla that her motive towards the fire was that she was jealous of her and that she still wishes Carla had died in the fire, Carla drives back to the street and the police arrest Tracy. However, Tracy is later released without charge.\n\nNick proposes to Carla and she is shocked to learn that Aidan used his father, Johnny's money to buy into the factory, and thus Johnny and Aidan's sister Kate move to Weatherfield and begin working there. While in prison, Rob begins sending Johnny visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be Carla's father. Johnny steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, and heads for a casino where she bumps into [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), and after gambling with him, they have sex. She instantly regrets it and confides in Michelle, who persuades Carla not to tell Nick. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their one-night stand if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit a secret. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, however after he persuades her, she changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the Bistro to confront him. As a power cut has forced the restaurant to close early, Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Unbeknown to the pair, but Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows in alcohol. However, [[Jamie Bowman]] (James Atherton), and his friend burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla, pinning her down on the floor. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase, jumping into the van, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the van drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious.\n\nMonths later, Tracy begins blackmailing Carla, threatening to tell Nick about her and Robert if she does not persuade Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert and leave Weatherfield. Robert and Leanne both put in matching offers for the Bistro, so Tracy demands \u00a310,000 from Carla. Carla convinces Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert; he does, but Tracy continues taunting Carla. Closer to the wedding, Robert finds out what Tracy has been doing to Carla but they stay together. Nick and Carla break up when he feels guilty after throwing a mug at Carla, causing her to cut her face. They get back together when she supports him. On the wedding day, Tracy tries to ruin proceedings by sending the flowers to the wrong address. Carla feels guilty, so she tells Nick about the one-night stand with Robert; he manages to forgive her. Tracy then announces that she has been blackmailing Carla, which Nick finds more difficult to accept. They eventually marry but Nick instantly regrets it, leaving the venue and Carla in tears. Carla asks Roy to get his car so that she can flee Weatherfield. However, she instead gets in her own car. In front of her, Tracy taunts her and Carla speeds up her car to run Tracy over. Tracy moves but a truck drove by [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) and his girlfriend [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) comes into her path and she swerves, knocking over Roy's partner, [[Cathy Matthews]] ([[Melanie Hill]]) before crashing into the postbox. Carla escapes unharmed, but Cathy lies on the ground motionless. Tyrone crashes into the Platt household, but he and Fiz also escape unharmed, with the help from Nick's half-brother [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]). Roy goes with Cathy to the hospital and as he is Carla, who is being held back by police, tries to apologise for what she has done. The next day, Carla decides to leave for [[Devon]] even though the car crashes are pending investigation. Before leaving, she visits the hospital to see Cathy. Cathy forgives her but Roy finds it more difficult to. She tells Roy she is leaving, but Cathy insists that he reconciles with Carla, however, he declares, \"Carla is who she is, and will never change\". Carla then says an emotional farewell to Johnny, Michelle, Aidan, and Kate. Tracy walks out of her florists and Carla declares, \"We're done\". She then gets in Johnny's car to depart. However, a bus comes and Roy dashes over. Johnny stops the car, with Roy and Carla sharing a final farewell. He forgives her for running over Cathy but tells her she should try to love herself. Carla then kisses Roy on the cheek before getting back in the car and leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Devon.\n\n===2017\u2013===\nOver a year later, Carla meets Aidan in a pub after he calls for her help in saving Underworld. However, she refuses and leaves, stating that she has a new life now. She returns on Christmas Day, with a great response from her family and Michelle. Carla refuses to drink during the day which is picked up upon numerous times. While visiting she says that she will become a partner in Underworld with Aidan. She later bumps into Tracy who calls her a goblin to which Carla replies, \"just think of me as a Ghost of Christmas Past\".  It is declared that she must be up to something when she is seen pouring a drink down the sink in the bathroom as everyone in the pub is singing. Carla invites Roy to join her and the family for New Year's Eve in the Rover's Return.  Roy wants Carla to tell her family about her [[kidney failure]]\u2014she has only shared with him her need for a kidney transplant.  Roy has agreed to keep quiet about her condition but says she needs support and must tell them. Carla struggles with her illness and as everyone welcomes in the New Year, she breaks down; Roy witnesses this and asks her to move in with him. She agrees and goes back inside while Roy searches online \"how to donate a kidney\", unbeknownst to Carla. Carla also grows close to [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]), Peter and Tracy\u2019s half-brother, upon her return. She clashes with Peter's new partner, [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who sees her as a threat. Carla, however, refuses to tell her family about her illness, despite numerous advice from Roy. She later collapses in the street and is found by [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn]]) and is rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, Roy tells her that he was tested for a kidney match but was not successful, which touched Carla. She decides to listen to him and upon hearing that her situation is getting more critical, she tells Kate and Aidan who both tell her that they will get tested.\n\nOn the day that Aidan and Kate get tested, Carla meets Daniel and they go round to his flat. After they establish a certain spark between them both, they have sex. Afterwards, they leave the flat and kiss on the doorstep which Daniel's ex-girlfriend, [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) witnesses whilst going round to get back with Daniel as he had earlier given her a present. They later meet up for a drink later on in the Rovers Return, whom Peter is now landlord of with Toyah. Peter tells Carla that he saw them together earlier and it is obvious that Peter is jealous. Whilst there, she meets Aidan who tells her that he has been tested. Peter also talks with Daniel and pesters about what was going on that afternoon. However, Sinead's aunt [[Beth Tinker|Beth Sutherland]] ([[Lisa George]]) storms into the pub and argues with Carla about their kiss on the doorstep which everybody hears including Peter who sarcastically comments - \"you make a great couple\". The next day, Peter taunts Carla about Daniel suggesting that she is only doing it to get back at him. Carla disagrees by saying, \"don\u2019t flatter yourself\" and says sarcastically that Toyah is lucky, clearly because he is jealous of Carla. She later meets Daniel again and they go on a date where she orders a bottle of wine - her first alcoholic drink in a while. Aidan and Kate disapprove but she goes ahead and drinks anyway before collapsing which is met by an audience of Tracy who also teases her about Daniel. Carla and Daniel later meet again in the Rovers as both Aidan and Kate find out they are donor matches. After being refused a drink by Peter and Toyah after stumbling to the bar, Carla collapses again as Roy reveals that she has kidney failure to all her family, Peter, Daniel, and Toyah. Peter worries about her as she is taken to hospital with disapproval from Toyah. Tracey later finds out and is taken aback as she too has had kidney failure. At the hospital, Aidan agrees to donate his kidney as Carla\u2019s situation becomes even more critical with the doctors saying that she needs a new kidney quick. Aidan is praised by the rest of the family and Carla who thanks him. The next day, Peter visits her in the hospital and brings her a book where Daniel already is. Once again, Peter shows jealousy but he and Carla appear to get on with Peter saying that he still cares.\n\nAfter realising that she might die, Carla tells Sinead that Daniel still likes her and that she doesn\u2019t want her last moments to be stealing somebody else\u2019s man. Aidan later has his operation and Carla has a kidney transplant - which are both successful. Afterward, Carla tells Roy that she is renting out her house in Devon and moving back to Weatherfield for good, much to his delight. Carla later sleeps with Michelle\u2019s biological son [[Alex Neeson|Ali Neeson]] (James Burrows) who was swapped at birth and won\u2019t speak to his mother, after Carla tries to make amends between them. She hides this from Michelle. Carla later gives Aidan 100% of Underworld on his birthday, to which he responds nervously, which leads to Johnny suspecting that he is hiding something. Carla later discovers that Robert, who is now engaged to Michelle, is using [[steroids]]. She agrees to not tell Michelle but confides in Ali about it as he is a [[general practitioner|GP]]. After asking how Ali is dealing with the situation, Ali tries to kiss Carla and although she refuses at first, they share a more passionate kiss as Michelle walks out on them both. Michelle is extremely angry at Carla and they fall out. Carla then tells Ali that her friendship with Michelle will come first and won\u2019t let him stay the night at Roy\u2019s.\n\nCarla is left distraught when Aidan commits [[suicide]] but manages to stay strong and support her family. The day after his death, she reopens the factory which shocks the employees as it is so soon after his death. She continues to run it until Michelle finds Aidan\u2019s will, which reveals he has left it to Alya Nazir, whom Carla doesn\u2019t get on with and would hate for her to own the factory. Michelle and Carla seek legal advice as the will was written before Carla gave 100% of the factory to Aidan and keep it a secret from Alya. In the coming weeks, tension arises between Alya and Carla. She is told that she will have to say that Aidan was mentally unstable when he wrote his will and she later lashes out at Alya causing her to quit her job at Underworld before Carla breaks down and locks herself in her office. She tells Michelle that she feels responsible for Aidan\u2019s suicide as she put pressure on him when giving him the factory. Unknown to Carla, Alya is later given Aidan\u2019s will which shows that she is the sole owner of Underworld. Alya and her lawyer [[Imran Habeeb]] (Charlie de Melo) tell the Connors that she knows and Johnny finds out about Aidan\u2019s will, telling Carla that he will disown her if she contests it. On the day of Aidan\u2019s funeral, Carla contemplates drinking. Before the service, Alya appears and Carla threatens her. Carla is later furious when Alya changes Underworld\u2019s locks on the same day and storms over to Alya. After calming down, Carla tells her that she can have the 18% as it is what she would\u2019ve had anyway. Despite this, Alya refuses and Carla tells her that she\u2019ll see her in court.\n\nCarla later asks Beth Tinker to get inside information about Underworld in exchange for a rent-free flat. She also gets Peter involved and they go on several dates. He helps the Connor family as they fight [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) for custody of [[Susie Price (Coronation Street)|Susie Price]], as he previously believed this was his child. On the day before the mediation, he brings around a birth certificate to prove Eva lied about her parents. Carla is, however, sceptical about showing this as it would get Eva into a lot of trouble. Johnny later kidnaps Susie and Carla supports him. She shouts at Eva in the street when Johnny is arrested. Johnny is, however, later released, and the Connors forgive Eva when she leaves. A week later, Peter tells Carla that he thinks there\u2019s still a flame between them but she shouts at him and tells him that he\u2019s stupid.  Alya later tells Carla that she is selling the factory in order to fund her family\u2019s restaurant. Initially, it is for 18% less than the price but Alya later puts it up. Alya also gives Carla a video of Aidan doing an interview about being a kidney donor. Carla struggles with finding money for the factory but Peter rescues her by becoming her partner. Carla later breaks down over Aidan\u2019s death saying that she blames herself but Johnny reassures her and later on Carla and Peter meet and end up kissing. The next day, they talk about the kiss and both say it didn\u2019t mean anything, although the factory girls and her family are sceptical about Peter\u2019s motive for helping Carla. Peter later tells Carla that he doesn\u2019t want to be a sleeping partner and that he is to work full time at the factory, shocking her. A few weeks later, Carla and Peter interview new staff for the factory and Carla brings in someone who looks like Tina, to catch Peter out. However, he realises and she is shocked that he doesn\u2019t want to employ her. This makes Carla realise that she might actually have feelings for him as he appears to have changed. The next day, after trying to protect Simon from a gang, she witnesses Peter shot and fears that he has died. Luckily, it was only a paint gun but she realises she has feelings for him and confesses to Michelle and is met with a cold response. A few months later, Nick returns and Carla\u2019s feelings for Peter grow stronger. However, she finds out that he is planning to sell his share of the factory although manages to stall him. Unknown to her, Peter finds an application to buy his share from a while back, addressed to Carla and sells his share to Nick, shocking Carla when she is about to tell him about her feelings. At first, they struggle to work together but manage as Nick tells a lie to Carla about what he has been up to. Carla, however, knows it\u2019s a lie and after doing some digging finds out that he has a wife, who spots her rummaging through his car. She later confronts her and they talk about Nick. Carla later meets with Nick and blackmails him, telling him that he either sells his share over to her or she tells his wife, [[Elsa Tilsley|Elsa]] ([[Kelly Harrison]]) and Leanne, who is now seeing, about the marriage and his relationship.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2018, Carla shares a game of snooker with Peter and they share a heart to heart, with them both confessing their love with each other. Carla is later upset when she sees [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]) and Peter together, which he notices. Later on, he asks her about this as he can see her jealousy, although Carla rejects him when he tries to kiss her. Carla later comforts Peter when the boat sets on fire and Simon is trapped on board. Unknown to both Carla and Peter, Roy accidentally set the boat alight whilst sleepwalking, something which Carla is helping him cope with. Peter blames Abi as he broke up with her earlier in the day. She later finds out that it was Roy because of CCTV footage in the factory, although she lets Abi take the blame and destroys all evidence that Roy started it without telling him. However, Abi is later given an alibi and everyone starts to accuse Carla of starting it, including Peter, out of jealousy. Roy, however, later finds his clothes and Carla is forced to tell him the truth. He is devastated and tells Peter, who agrees to not pursue the matter further. Roy insists on going to the police but argues furiously with Carla telling her that she didn\u2019t cover up the fire to protect him and instead did it out of jealousy, wanting Abi locked up as she is still in love with Peter, leaving Carla in tears. The following day, Roy tells Carla that she should find somewhere else to live. A week later, Carla ignores the fact the roof of the factory needs replacing and tells [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) that she can\u2019t afford it. She instead focuses on starting a new business contract where workers and material would be supplied from abroad. Carla is later threatened by Robert, following his breakup with Michelle, as he is looking for someone to blame. Nick later finds out about her plans for outsourcing and Carla admits to her employees that she is planning to move production to [[Milton Keynes]] which they take badly. They go on strike and Nick swears revenge on Carla as he needs money. Peter tries to help but she tells him to back off and Gary also pesters her for repair money. She later sees that her car window has been smashed, to which Robert tells her it could be anyone as she now has a lot of enemies.\n\nThe next day, Kate is due to get married to [[Rana Habeeb]] ([[Bhavna Limbachia]]) but Carla finds out that Peter is leaving and manages to track him down. She breaks down in front of him and tells him she loves him and wants them to be together, but he tells her that although he loves her, she will \"kill him\" and he leaves anyway, leaving Carla distraught. Unknown to her, the workers have broken into Underworld in a protest. However, the factory roof collapses, leaving residents such as Sally, Rana, Sean, [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]), [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Paul Foreman|Paul Foreman]] ([[Peter Ash]]), [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell) unconscious and injured. Carla later drowns her sorrows in a pub, but realises she should be at Kate's wedding. However, upon arriving on the street she finds out about the collapse and that Rana is trapped inside after going to fetch her bag. Peter arrives to comfort Carla as he finds out about the collapse and Carla breaks down to him, insisting it was her fault, as they find out that Rana has died in the incident. Carla initially wants to tell the police the truth as they want to interview her but Peter bribes Gary with \u00a310,000 to keep quiet and they say that neither of them knew that the roof needed repairing. Carla is suspicious of the health and safety inspector and Roy\u2019s previous foster son [[Wayne Hayes (Coronation Street)|Wayne Hayes]] (Adam Barlow) and leaves for a short break with Peter after he says he loves her and will be there. A week later the pair return and Carla is arrested at Rana\u2019s memorial for manslaughter and the residents start to blame her for Rana\u2019s death, including Kate. Upon being released from police custody, Carla visits Aidan\u2019s grave where she is verbally attacked and starts receiving text messages from an anonymous person pretending to be Rana telling her the roof collapse was \"her fault\". Later on Carla rings the phone number believing it to actually be Rana and that she is still alive, showing that her mental health is deteriorating. She later finds out that it is Alya sending the messages as Kate tells her, although she starts believing everybody is plotting against her and starts hearing voices. The next day, she starts feeling trapped and [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) tries to help, aware of her paranoia. She runs outside barefoot and bumps into the police and Alya, who she believes has been sent to spy on her. Peter manages to find her and takes her to the medical centre where Carla tries to find Rana, whom she believes is still alive. Toyah attempts to help her but she escapes through the window when Toyah leaves to try and get professional mental health support.\n\nPeter begins to look for her and manages to get Johnny to help him. He reports her missing to the police but refuses to believe they will help and possibly arrest her when she is found. He posts an image of her online and gets a reply from a man at a squat on her old estate, which he follows up and comes to nothing. The police later tell him that she was seen drawing money out of a cash machine and returning to the squat. He goes back with Johnny and threatens the man, who makes it clear that she isn\u2019t there. Peter and Johnny leave as Carla watches from the window. She is told to find somewhere else to go as Peter causes trouble. She acknowledges this as not being safe \"from Peter\". Robert later finds Carla in a hotel in town when the staff shout \"Mrs. Donovan\" and she panics upon seeing him. However, he later catches up with her and tries to calm her down saying he is there for her and attempts to bring her back to the street. Upon returning, she runs away as Robert tries to find her, he is stalled by a man who punches him, thinking Carla is threatened. Robert later tells the family and they run into the street shouting her, as she hides behind a wall. Throughout the search, they find that Carla has been living in a hotel room, which she has ultimately destroyed. They also find she hasn\u2019t been taking medication for her kidney failure and may go into rejection. As the police start taking their search for her more serious, Carla panics and goes to Roy, whom she believes she can trust. However, when he rings her family to notify them that he has found her, she lashes out at Roy. An ambulance arrives as Carla breaks down. The doctor tells Roy and Johnny that her kidneys are fine but she demands to see Peter, who unknown to her, has been in rehab after a relapse. Peter visits and comforts her as she is psychologically assessed and is told she is to be discharged the following day but will need to be assessed every day and Roy lets her and Peter stay with him. Carla\u2019s condition worsens and she floods Roy\u2019s flat before stealing everyone\u2019s phones. Carla later hallucinates and thinks she sees Hayley and Rana before thinking Peter is Aidan. Peter saves her from jumping from the fire escape and she is [[sectioned]] before she is sent to a [[mental health]] facility in [[Carlisle]] where Peter stays with her.\n\nA few months later, a seemingly better Carla and Peter return to Weatherfield. She insists she is recovering but Peter keeps worrying about her. Carla announces that she\u2019s giving her share of Underworld to each of the employees and she gets a job at Viaduct Bistro. She later quits when she finds out the employees have been in a group chat that Peter has set up, wanting to check up on her. She also kicks Peter out of Roy\u2019s but lies they are still together.\n\n==Casting==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CarlaConnor2007.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Carla Connor as she appeared in 2007.]]  -->On 20 September 2006, it was reported that the former ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'' actress, Alison King, had been cast as Carla Connor.

She wishes to try her hand at other projects before returning to the part of Carla Connor, a role she has enjoyed playing for nine years.

At the end of this month, she will be central to the explosive storyline which sees Victoria Court go up in flames, and the aftermath of that plotline will have huge consequences for the factory boss.

A special week aired from 22 to 26 May alongside the ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' semi-final just like in previous years. A trailer also accompanied the shows and after each episode, a preview of the next episode was shown. The episodes had to be broadcast at 9 pm because of the content within them. Two storylines were put into this week, the wedding and the discovery of [[Callum Logan]]'s (Sean Ward) body. This involved the Platt family heavily and Carla caused the crash into the house where the body was hidden, finishing the storyline from his murder which had started in September 2015.

It was revealed that it would become apparent that Carla is being targeted. Producer Iain MacLeod explained that the collapse \"will trigger a massive story for Carla because it impacts massively on her mental health\" and that she feels \"correctly that everybody is out to get her and she spirals off into a slightly delusional state\". It was also confirmed that Carla would get a stand-alone episode, which has been compared to MacLeod's production at ''[[Emmerdale]]'', in which he created an episode focused around [[Ashley Thomas]]' ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) [[Vascular dementia|dementia]]. Commenting on this, MacLeod has added, \"We're doing something a little bit stylised, like the Ashley story I did at ''Emmerdale'', but it won't be quite as extreme as that. It's a stand-alone episode that will be both mental health-focused and Carla focused. It will also be the reveal to the audience of who is behind the factory roof collapsing. I'd hesitate to put a diagnosis on what it is affecting Carla, but the factory collapse has lots of unexpected offshoots into areas that give our amazing cast a chance to show off their acting chops.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tone of the episode, MacLeod added: \"We're inside Carla's head, but I'm still unsure about how far we explore what's real and what's not real.\" In the run-up to the factory disaster, a determined Carla will be seen ploughing all her energies into making the business a market leader, but this ends up having fatal consequences for her workforce: \"It comes from a workaholicism story for Carla. She makes the decision that her life's priority is her work. She wants to turn the factory into a world-beating business. But that leads to her making mistakes in both her personal and professional life. She ends up getting on the wrong side of a lot of people. And by the time of the collapse, many of them will wish her ill.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-12-18/carlas-mental-health-breakdown-to-be-focus-of-special-standalone-coronation-street/amp/ | work = Radio Times | title = Carla's mental health breakdown to be focus of a special episode  | accessdate = 18 December 2018}}</ref> A trailer of the storyline, which shows Carla breaking down, was released on 11 March 2019.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nColumnist [[Grace Dent]] has described Carla as \"...an alluring vision, raven haired, classy, sultry and replete with guile\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/26/television.culture |title=Grace Dent's world of lather &#124; Media |work=The Guardian|date= 26 January 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The episode aired on 3 December 2008, in which Carla married Tony Gordon attracted an impressive peak of 10.5 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/04/tvratings-coronationstreet |title=TV ratings \u2013 3 December: More than 10 million viewers watch Coronation Street wedding &#124; Media |work=The Guardian|date= 4 December 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, the character was heralded as the new [[Elsie Tanner]]: \"strong, dark, mouthy, pushy, full of herself and nobody's fool, ready to put the world to rights with another lashing of lipstick.

He made the point that while it was being treated with more sensitivity than the rape of [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) was, back in 2001, the impression was that the writing team were placing too much pain and anguish upon Carla's character: \"By having Carla undergo a vicious violation like rape, it begins to feel that she's being systematically targeted by the storyliners. There's no denying that the scenes in this evening's double bill are powerfully acted by Alison King, but there seems to be an underlying mission to crack open Carla's carapace and expose her vulnerability. In the wider world, rapists often choose their targets regardless of the victim's circumstance, so there's no saying that Carla wouldn\u2019t suffer an assault of this sort. But, in a fictional setting, it does begin to look cruel when so much anguish is piled onto one person's shoulders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla's-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |title=Is Carla's rape an ordeal too far? |publisher=Radio Times Blog |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924031529/http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla%27s-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |archivedate=24 September 2011  }}</ref>\n\nSarah Ellis of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that Carla was great to watch when she is with Peter.

Although King is not on [[social media]] herself, many fan base accounts have been set up on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]]. The character is also amongst many discussions on ''Twitter'' and often finds herself 'trending' after an episode. Examples of the fans' involvement are such things as when she left in 2016, many people were calling for her return straight after the episode. In 2018 also, when Carla began her feud with Alya Nazir, ''Coronation Street'' put out [[hashtags]] with either #TeamAlya or #TeamCarla. Over 1,000 people responded with #TeamCarla and this yet again became a discussion on social media, with many fans criticising the character of Alya just because of her attitude towards Carla. Peter and Carla's relationship also has its own nickname by fans, which is Carter. The #Carter hashtag has been used numerous times since her 2017 return.\n\n===Accolades===\nIn an online poll conducted by ''MSN Entertainment'', Carla Connor was voted as 'Soapland's Sexiest Female of 2008', with more than 31% of votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525180403/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |archivedate=25 May 2009  }}</ref> At the 2008 ''Inside Soap Awards'', the character was voted \"Best Bitch\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen |first=Liam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7642263.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; EastEnders dominates soap awards |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> King was awarded \"Best Actress\" at [[British Soap Awards#2012 winners|The British Soap Awards 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jim|title=Eastenders wins top prize at British Soap Awards|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/17886011|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=29 April 2012}}</ref> On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, King was nominated for \"Best Female Soap Actor\" and came fifth with 9.7% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders', Corrie, 'Hollyoaks' all win in Digital Spy's 2012 poll|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a446819/eastenders-corrie-hollyoaks-all-win-in-digital-spys-2012-poll.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}</ref> King was nominated for the \"Best Actress\" award at [[The British Soap Awards#2014 winners|The British Soap Awards 2014]], and was nominated for the award again in the [[British Soap Awards#2015 winners|2015 ceremony]].

Launched on 24 March 1898, ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' was commissioned in October 1902. In 1904, she was damaged after hitting a submerged rock. In 1910, she ran aground on [[Spartel]], and had to be taken in tow by {{ship|French cruiser|Victor Hugo}}. From 1913, she was used as a school ship in Toulon.\n\nRecommissioned at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' patrolled the Mediterranean. In 1917, she was used as a [[troopship]], ferrying soldiers from [[Taranto]] to [[Itea, Phocis|Itea]]. On 5 October 1917, she rescued survivors of the liner {{SS|Gallia||2}}, torpedoed by the [[Imperial German Navy]] [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-35|Germany|2}}, and saved 1,200 men.\n\n==Design==\n\n===General characteristics and machinery===\n[[File:Chateaurenault Brassey's.png|thumb|left|Profile and plan drawing of ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'']]\n\n''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' was {{cvt|135|m|ftin}} [[long at the waterline]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|17|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|7.39|m|ftin}}.

''UC-38'' then dived to {{Convert|38|m}}, while ''Mameluck'' and ''Rouen'' rushed to the launching position of the torpedo, and ''Lansquenet'' started picking up people thrown overboard by the explosion. ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' requested her escorts to close in and evacuate Army personnel, which was completed by 07:26. The trawler ''Balsamine'' came to the rescue and made attempts to take ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' in tow.\n\nRising to [[periscope depth]], SM ''UC-38'' saw ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' still afloat, and launched a second torpedo, which hit at 8:20; ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' foundered quickly, though the surviving crew aboard were rescued. ''Lansquenet'', in the process of picking up her launches, rushed to the launching point and dropping 7 depth charges. One caused a slight leak in the submarine; Wendlandt ordered a dive to bring his ship below the area targeted by the depth charges, but a false man\u0153uvre made ''UC-38'' climb instead, and a second explosion caused a large leak, forcing Wendlandt to surface and abandon ship.\n\nSM ''UC-38'' surfaced briefly and was immediately targeted by the guns of ''Mameluck'', which continued her attack by launching several depth charges. SM ''UC-38'' surfaced again, and this time both ''Mameluck'' and ''Lansquenet'' opened fire, hitting her several times and killing several of her crew as they abandoned ship. She sank at 08:40, and the French destroyers picked up the survivors.\n\nGerman sources claim that 25 men were rescued and 9 killed; a sailor of SM ''UC-38'' claimed that 20 men were saved out of a 28-man crew; French enquiry reports 20 rescued and 5 confirmed dead out of a 27-man crew. From ''Ch\u00e2teaurenault'' 1,162 men were saved by ''Rouen'', ''Mameluck'' and ''Lansquenet'', and by a number of trawlers who had rushed to the scene, amounting to most of the personnel aboard.

But Universal wasn't interested in these ideas. John Murdy, the creative director of Universal's Halloween Horror Nights did allow Galluzzo to shoot an interview at the Bates Motel and Psycho house sets on the backlot. Pictures and footage from all the films had to be licensed from Universal which accounted for the majority of the documentary's budget.\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in January 2007. Director Robert Galluzzo shot interviews with ''Psycho'' cast and crew members over the next three years. Galluzzo personally financed the production as he described it as a \"labour of love project\". Different types of digital video cameras were used to film the interviews over the three-year-long production, thus giving the documentary an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of both fullscreen and widescreen. Galluzzo and editor Jon Maus used school equipment to edit the footage together first into a 12-minute promotional video and then the full documentary. Galluzzo stated in an interview with Retro Slashers.com: \" The shoot itself was just my dear friend John Torrani, who had a Panasonic DVX-100 camera and myself. He was crazy enough to follow me on this journey and for that, I\u2019m eternally grateful to him! Essentially, I made a ton of phone calls, sent out a ton of emails and did my best to contact as many ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' alumni as possible to arrange interviews. Most of them are based out of California, so I\u2019d work at my dayjob for 3 months straight, then take 2 weeks off to go shoot some interviews. And then come back and do it all over again. That\u2019s the main reason it\u2019s taken so long is because I had to go back to work and save up the money to continue shooting. This was always a labor of love, so I did anything I could to make it work and get just a tiny bit further along.\"\n\n==Promotion==\nIn April 2008, at the [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors|Fangoria horror convention]], a Psycho reunion panel was held to promote the documentary. Many cast members attended including [[Hilton A. Green]], [[Mick Garris]], [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]], [[Kurt Paul]], [[Juliette Cummins]], Katt Shea, Cynthia Garris, Chris Hendrie and more. It was also promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic Con 2010]].\n\n==Release==\nThe documentary premiered at the 2010 [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] on October 16, 2010, followed by a Q&A with [[Mick Garris]], Cynthia Garris and Katt Shea.\nThe documentary is set for a DVD release on October 19, 2010 over [[Shout! Factory]].<ref>[http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/06/the_psycho_movies_website_rela_1.html The Psycho Movies Website Relaunches!]</ref> Special features include a rare 41 minute panel discussion with Anthony Perkins, Extended Interviews, Deleted Scenes, Remembering ''Psycho II'' featurette, Shooting Psycho II featurette, The Bates Motel tour featurette, Catching up with Mother featurette, Psycho Reunion Panel, Psycho on the Web, [[Hyaena Gallery]] Presents: Serial Killer Inspired Art and Norman Bates in Print featurette. The documentary is also being released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on October 18, 2011. It was also released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in Germany on February 14, 2012. Releases in other countries is yet to be decided.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe documentary has received mostly positive reviews. Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com says \"Overall, I think this doc is a great way for Shout! Factory and Masi Media LLC to help us all celebrate the 50th birthday of Alfred Hitchcock's beloved ''Psycho''\". Jason Allentoff of The Psycho Movies.com says \"RobG's look at this film series is incredible. It's a shame Universal hasn't taken notice.\" Matt Fini of Dread Central.com says \" As far as ''Psycho'' is now concerned, we\u2019ve thankfully got this documentary so that we won\u2019t forget.\" Mike Gencarelli of Movie Mikes says \"If you add the amazing feature film to these special features you have the ultimate collection for all ''Psycho'' fans.\" William David Lee of DVD Town.com says \"The retrospective may not be as in-depth as some would like, there is enough to sate the appetites of the most die-hard \"Psycho\" followers.\" Horror Talk.com claims \"Director Galluzzo does his best with a lot of fine material and keeps things moving at a decent clip, but repeat viewings will reveal the limitations that keep this from being the ultimate experience that it should be.\"\n\nTyler Foster of DVD Talk.com says \"There are things to like, about both the feature and the extras, but I can only recommend a rental \u2013 spend your money on the new Blu-ray Disc of ''Psycho'' instead.\" Joe Shearer of Film Yap.com says \"If you\u2019re a fan of the ''Psycho'' franchise, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend this DVD. If you\u2019re a classicist looking for insights on Hitchcock, I\u2019d say you might come away from this disappointed.\" Some critics  were disappointed with the fact that the [[Robert Bloch]] novels were barely discussed in the documentary and that the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] were not mentioned. However originally in the deleted scenes section of the DVD there was supposed to be two short segments about the TV pilot and remake but for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. Some critics also criticized the low-budget production values of the film. Citing issues with the sound and [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the documentary. The documentary received a 7.0 out of 10 rating from IGN.<ref>http://dvd.ign.com/articles/112/1128607p1.html </ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1230161}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_psycho_legacy|The Psycho Legacy}}\n\n{{Psycho}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psycho Legacy, The}}\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:2010s documentary films]]\n[[Category:2010 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Psycho (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video documentary films]]\n[[Category:Works about Alfred Hitchcock]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about horror]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Psycho Legacy\n| image          = The Psycho Legacy.jpg\n| alt            = DVD cover art\n| caption        = DVD cover art\n| director       = Robert Galluzzo\n| producer       = {{ubl|Robert Galluzzo|Anthony Masi}}\n| writer         = Robert Galluzzo\n| narrator       = Paul Ehlers\n| starring       = {{ubl|[[Anthony Perkins]]|[[Diana Scarwid]]|[[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]}}[[Mick Garris]]\n| music          = Jermaine Stegall\n| cinematography = John Torrani\n| editing        = Jon Maus\n| studio         = [[Masimedia]]\n| distributor    = [[Shout!

But Universal wasn't interested in these ideas. John Murdy, the creative director of Universal's Halloween Horror Nights did allow Galluzzo to shoot an interview at the Bates Motel and Psycho house sets on the backlot. Pictures and footage from all the films had to be licensed from Universal which accounted for the majority of the documentary's budget.\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in January 2007. Director Robert Galluzzo shot interviews with ''Psycho'' cast and crew members over the next three years. Galluzzo personally financed the production as he described it as a \"labour of love project\". Different types of digital video cameras were used to film the interviews over the three-year-long production, thus giving the documentary an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of both fullscreen and widescreen. Galluzzo and editor Jon Maus used school equipment to edit the footage together first into a 12-minute promotional video and then the full documentary. Galluzzo stated in an interview with Retro Slashers.com: \" The shoot itself was just my dear friend John Torrani, who had a Panasonic DVX-100 camera and myself. He was crazy enough to follow me on this journey and for that, I\u2019m eternally grateful to him! Essentially, I made a ton of phone calls, sent out a ton of emails and did my best to contact as many ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' alumni as possible to arrange interviews. Most of them are based out of California, so I\u2019d work at my dayjob for 3 months straight, then take 2 weeks off to go shoot some interviews. And then come back and do it all over again. That\u2019s the main reason it\u2019s taken so long is because I had to go back to work and save up the money to continue shooting. This was always a labor of love, so I did anything I could to make it work and get just a tiny bit further along.\"\n\n==Promotion==\nIn April 2008, at the [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors|Fangoria horror convention]], a Psycho reunion panel was held to promote the documentary. Many cast members attended including [[Hilton A. Green]], [[Mick Garris]], [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]], [[Kurt Paul]], [[Juliette Cummins]], Katt Shea, Cynthia Garris, Chris Hendrie and more. It was also promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic Con 2010]].\n\n==Release==\nThe documentary premiered at the 2010 [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] on October 16, 2010, followed by a Q&A with [[Mick Garris]], Cynthia Garris and Katt Shea.\nThe documentary is set for a DVD release on October 19, 2010 over [[Shout! Factory]].<ref>[http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/06/the_psycho_movies_website_rela_1.html The Psycho Movies Website Relaunches!]</ref> Special features include a rare 41 minute panel discussion with Anthony Perkins, Extended Interviews, Deleted Scenes, Remembering ''Psycho II'' featurette, Shooting Psycho II featurette, The Bates Motel tour featurette, Catching up with Mother featurette, Psycho Reunion Panel, Psycho on the Web, [[Hyaena Gallery]] Presents: Serial Killer Inspired Art and Norman Bates in Print featurette. The documentary is also being released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on October 18, 2011. It was also released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in Germany on February 14, 2012. Releases in other countries is yet to be decided.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe documentary has received mostly positive reviews. Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com says \"Overall, I think this doc is a great way for Shout! Factory and Masi Media LLC to help us all celebrate the 50th birthday of Alfred Hitchcock's beloved ''Psycho''\". Jason Allentoff of The Psycho Movies.com says \"RobG's look at this film series is incredible. It's a shame Universal hasn't taken notice.\" Matt Fini of Dread Central.com says \" As far as ''Psycho'' is now concerned, we\u2019ve thankfully got this documentary so that we won\u2019t forget.\" Mike Gencarelli of Movie Mikes says \"If you add the amazing feature film to these special features you have the ultimate collection for all ''Psycho'' fans.\" William David Lee of DVD Town.com says \"The retrospective may not be as in-depth as some would like, there is enough to sate the appetites of the most die-hard \"Psycho\" followers.\" Horror Talk.com claims \"Director Galluzzo does his best with a lot of fine material and keeps things moving at a decent clip, but repeat viewings will reveal the limitations that keep this from being the ultimate experience that it should be.\"\n\nTyler Foster of DVD Talk.com says \"There are things to like, about both the feature and the extras, but I can only recommend a rental \u2013 spend your money on the new Blu-ray Disc of ''Psycho'' instead.\" Joe Shearer of Film Yap.com says \"If you\u2019re a fan of the ''Psycho'' franchise, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend this DVD. If you\u2019re a classicist looking for insights on Hitchcock, I\u2019d say you might come away from this disappointed.\" Some critics  were disappointed with the fact that the [[Robert Bloch]] novels were barely discussed in the documentary and that the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] were not mentioned. However originally in the deleted scenes section of the DVD there was supposed to be two short segments about the TV pilot and remake but for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. Some critics also criticized the low-budget production values of the film. Citing issues with the sound and [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the documentary. The documentary received a 7.0 out of 10 rating from IGN.<ref>http://dvd.ign.com/articles/112/1128607p1.html </ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1230161}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_psycho_legacy|The Psycho Legacy}}\n\n{{Psycho}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psycho Legacy, The}}\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:2010s documentary films]]\n[[Category:2010 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Psycho (franchise) films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video documentary films]]\n[[Category:Works about Alfred Hitchcock]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about horror]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psycho_Legacy"}

Some 1.7 million workers went out, especially in transport and heavy industry. The government was prepared and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services.  There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat. Though nine days in, the TUC leadership knew 'the government could hold out longer than the workers', it was perceived at the time as a 'brilliant failure'. According to a leading [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] researcher, Walter Milne-Bailey, 'There has never been a more amazing display of labour solidarity and the effect of such a demonstration must inevitably be deep and enduring. Workers have learnt a new sense of their oneness and their power.'<ref>W Milne-Bailey, ''A Nation on Strike'' (1926) Unpublished typescript, TUC Library, London Metropolitan University</ref> In the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won more seats than any other party in Parliament for the first time in its history.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:The Subsidised Mineowner.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Subsidised Mineowner\u2014Poor Beggar!'' from ''Trade Union Unity Magazine'' (1925)]]\n* The [[First World War]]: The heavy domestic use of coal in the war meant that rich seams were depleted.

The [[Miners Federation of Great Britain]] rejected the terms: \"Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day.\" The [[Trades Union Congress]] responded to the news by promising to support the miners in their dispute. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government]], under [[Stanley Baldwin]], decided to intervene by declaring that a nine-month subsidy would be provided to maintain the miners' wages and that a [[Royal Commission]], under the chairmanship of [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], would look into the problems of the mining industry and consider its impact on other industries, families and organisations dependent on coal supplies industry.\n\nThe [[Samuel Commission]] published a report on 10 March 1926 recommending that national agreements, the [[nationalisation]] of royalties and sweeping reorganisation and improvement should be considered for the mining industry.<ref>Robertson, D.

During the next two days, frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement between the government and the mining industry representatives. However, they failed, mainly because<ref>Keith Laybourn (1993). The General Strike of 1926. Manchester UP. p. 43</ref> of an eleventh-hour decision by printers of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to refuse to print an editorial (\"For King and Country\") condemning the general strike. They objected to the following passage: \"A general strike is not an industrial dispute. It is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people\".\n[[File:Genral Strike 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Troops on guard at a bus station; each bus had a police escort during the strike]]\nBaldwin was now concerned about the TUC and printers' action interfering with the freedom of the press.\n\nKing [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] tried to stabilise the situation and create balance saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>David Sinclair, ''Two Georges: The Making of the Modern Monarchy.'' London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1988. p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe TUC feared that an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to [[National Union of Railwaymen|railwaymen]], [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport workers]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Transport and General Workers' Union|dockers]], [[ironworker]]s and [[steelworker]]s, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.\n\nThe government had been preparing for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy by creating organisations such as the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]], and it did whatever it could to keep the country moving. It rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers. The armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services. It used the [[Emergency Powers Act 1920]] to maintain essential supplies.\n\nOn 4 May 1926, the number of strikers was about 1.5\u20131.75 million. There were strikers \"[[Land's End to John o' Groats|from John o' Groats to Land's End]]\". The reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming and surprised both the government and the TUC; the latter not being in control of the strike. On this first day, there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nation's transport being at a standstill.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=\u201cConstitutional Government is being attacked. Let all good citizens whose livelihood and labour have thus been put in peril bear with fortitude and patience the hardships with which they have been so suddenly confronted. Stand behind the Government, who are doing their part, confident that you will cooperate in the measures they have undertaken to preserve the liberties and privileges of the people of these islands. The laws of England are the people's birthright. The laws are in your keeping. You have made Parliament their guardian. The General Strike is a challenge to Parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin.\u201d|source=[[Stanley Baldwin]], 6 May 1926, ''[[British Gazette]]''}}\nOn 5 May 1926, both sides gave their views. Churchill (at that time [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) commented as editor of the government newspaper ''[[British Gazette]]'': \"I do not agree that the TUC have as much right as the Government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action. It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it\". Baldwin wrote, \"The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to [[anarchy]]\". The ''[[British Worker]]'', the TUC's newspaper, wrote: \"We are not making war on the people. We are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government\".\n\nIn the meantime, the government put in place a \"[[militia]]\" of [[special constable]]s called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: \"It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |title=Nottinghamshire NUM Area History |publisher=Nottinghamshireexminer.com |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714201312/http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was decided that [[fascists]] would not be allowed to enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as the government feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called \"Q Division\" under [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]] to combat the strikers.\n\nOn 6 May 1926, there was a change of atmosphere. The government newspaper, ''[[British Gazette]]'', suggested that means of transport began to improve with volunteers and [[strikebreakers]], stating on the front page that there were '200 buses on the streets'.<ref>'Why Walk to Work?' ''British Worker'' Issue 2 (6 May 1926), p.1</ref> They were, however, figures of propaganda, as there were in fact only 86 buses running.<ref>Symons, J. ''The General Strike'' (London: Cresset Press, 1957) pg. 158</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1926, the TUC met with Samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute. The Miners' Federation rejected the proposals. The ''British Worker'' was increasingly difficult to operate, as Churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the paper's newsprint so it reduced its size from eight pages to four.<ref>'The British Worker and Paper Supplies,' ''The Times'' (8 May 1926), pg.4</ref> In the meantime, the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work.\n\nOn 8 May 1926, there was a dramatic moment on the London Docks. Lorries were protected by the army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park. That showed that the government was in greater control of the situation. It was also a measure of Baldwin's rationalism, in place of Churchill's more reactionary stance. Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise. In Plymouth, tram services are restarted, with some vehicles attacked and windows smashed. However, also in Plymouth, a football match, attended by thousands, occurs between a team of policemen and strikers, with the strikers winning 2-0.<ref>[https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/gs/timeline/day_5/ General Strike Day 5: Saturday 8 May 1926], University of Warwick, The Library</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''[[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]]'' was derailed by strikers near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=Renshaw|title=Nine days in May: the general strike|year=1975|publisher=Taylor & Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJMOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=RA3-PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780413332608}}</ref> The ''British Worker'', alarmed at the fears of the General Council of the TUC that there was to be a mass drift back to work, claimed: \"The number of strikers has not diminished; it is increasing.

The government stated that it had \"no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike\". However, the TUC agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced, by their own economic needs, to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages and district wage agreements. The strikers felt that they had achieved nothing.\n\nThe effect on British coal mines was profound. By the late 1930s, employment in mining had fallen by more than a third from its pre-strike peak of 1.2 million miners, but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner, to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Mathias, ''The First Industrial Nation,'' pg. 449.</ref>\n\nThe split in the miners that resulted from [[George Alfred Spencer|Spencerism]] and the agreement of the Nottinghamshire miners to return to work, against the policy of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain divided the coal miners as a national bargaining force until the establishment of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n\nThe [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] banned [[sympathy strikes]] and mass [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], and created a system whereby trade union members had to 'opt-in' to paying the political levy to the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford AQA history A level and AS component 2.

There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat.

During the next two days, frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement between the government and the mining industry representatives. However, they failed, mainly because<ref>Keith Laybourn (1993). The General Strike of 1926. Manchester UP. p. 43</ref> of an eleventh-hour decision by printers of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to refuse to print an editorial (\"For King and Country\") condemning the general strike. They objected to the following passage: \"A general strike is not an industrial dispute. It is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people\".\n[[File:Genral Strike 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Troops on guard at a bus station; each bus had a police escort during the strike]]\nBaldwin was now concerned about the TUC and printers' action interfering with the freedom of the press.\n\nKing [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] tried to stabilise the situation and create balance saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>David Sinclair, ''Two Georges: The Making of the Modern Monarchy.'' London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1988. p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe TUC feared that an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to [[National Union of Railwaymen|railwaymen]], [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport workers]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Transport and General Workers' Union|dockers]], [[ironworker]]s and [[steelworker]]s, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.\n\nThe government had been preparing for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy by creating organisations such as the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]], and it did whatever it could to keep the country moving. It rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers. The armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services. It used the [[Emergency Powers Act 1920]] to maintain essential supplies.\n\nOn 4 May 1926, the number of strikers was about 1.5\u20131.75 million. There were strikers \"[[Land's End to John o' Groats|from John o' Groats to Land's End]]\". The reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming and surprised both the government and the TUC; the latter not being in control of the strike. On this first day, there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nation's transport being at a standstill.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=\u201cConstitutional Government is being attacked.

The General Strike is a challenge to Parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin.\u201d|source=[[Stanley Baldwin]], 6 May 1926, ''[[British Gazette]]''}}\nOn 5 May 1926, both sides gave their views. Churchill (at that time [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) commented as editor of the government newspaper ''[[British Gazette]]'': \"I do not agree that the TUC have as much right as the Government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action. It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it\". Baldwin wrote, \"The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to [[anarchy]]\". The ''[[British Worker]]'', the TUC's newspaper, wrote: \"We are not making war on the people. We are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government\".\n\nIn the meantime, the government put in place a \"[[militia]]\" of [[special constable]]s called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: \"It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |title=Nottinghamshire NUM Area History |publisher=Nottinghamshireexminer.com |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714201312/http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was decided that [[fascists]] would not be allowed to enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as the government feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called \"Q Division\" under [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]] to combat the strikers.\n\nOn 6 May 1926, there was a change of atmosphere. The government newspaper, ''[[British Gazette]]'', suggested that means of transport began to improve with volunteers and [[strikebreakers]], stating on the front page that there were '200 buses on the streets'.<ref>'Why Walk to Work?' ''British Worker'' Issue 2 (6 May 1926), p.1</ref> They were, however, figures of propaganda, as there were in fact only 86 buses running.<ref>Symons, J. ''The General Strike'' (London: Cresset Press, 1957) pg. 158</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1926, the TUC met with Samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute. The Miners' Federation rejected the proposals. The ''British Worker'' was increasingly difficult to operate, as Churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the paper's newsprint so it reduced its size from eight pages to four.<ref>'The British Worker and Paper Supplies,' ''The Times'' (8 May 1926), pg.4</ref> In the meantime, the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work.\n\nOn 8 May 1926, there was a dramatic moment on the London Docks. Lorries were protected by the army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park. That showed that the government was in greater control of the situation. It was also a measure of Baldwin's rationalism, in place of Churchill's more reactionary stance. Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise. In Plymouth, tram services are restarted, with some vehicles attacked and windows smashed. However, also in Plymouth, a football match, attended by thousands, occurs between a team of policemen and strikers, with the strikers winning 2-0.<ref>[https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/gs/timeline/day_5/ General Strike Day 5: Saturday 8 May 1926], University of Warwick, The Library</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''[[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]]'' was derailed by strikers near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=Renshaw|title=Nine days in May: the general strike|year=1975|publisher=Taylor & Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJMOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=RA3-PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780413332608}}</ref> The ''British Worker'', alarmed at the fears of the General Council of the TUC that there was to be a mass drift back to work, claimed: \"The number of strikers has not diminished; it is increasing. There are more workers out today than there have been at any moment since the strike began\".\n\nHowever, the [[National Union of Seamen#The National Sailors' and Firemen's Union, 1894-1926|National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]] applied for an injunction in the [[Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice|Chancery Division of the High Court]] to enjoin the General-Secretary of its [[Tower Hill]] branch from calling its members out on strike. Mr [[John Meir Astbury|Justice Astbury]] granted the injunction by ruling that no trade dispute could exist between the TUC and \"the government of the nation\"<ref>Lee S. J. 1996 Aspects of British Political History 1914\u20131995 p 90]</ref> and that except for the strike in the coal industry, the general strike was not protected by [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]]. In addition, he ruled that the strike in the plaintiff union had been called in contravention of its own rules.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/789636 \"The Legality of the General Strike in England,\" A.

The government stated that it had \"no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike\". However, the TUC agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced, by their own economic needs, to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages and district wage agreements. The strikers felt that they had achieved nothing.\n\nThe effect on British coal mines was profound. By the late 1930s, employment in mining had fallen by more than a third from its pre-strike peak of 1.2 million miners, but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner, to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Mathias, ''The First Industrial Nation,'' pg. 449.</ref>\n\nThe split in the miners that resulted from [[George Alfred Spencer|Spencerism]] and the agreement of the Nottinghamshire miners to return to work, against the policy of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain divided the coal miners as a national bargaining force until the establishment of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n\nThe [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] banned [[sympathy strikes]] and mass [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], and created a system whereby trade union members had to 'opt-in' to paying the political levy to the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford AQA history A level and AS component 2.

The TUC and the trade union movement remained intact and did not change their basic policies. Keith Laybourn says that historians mostly agree that \"In no significant way could the General Strike be considered a turning point or watershed in British industrial history.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn|title=The General Strike of 1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEu8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA103|year=1993|publisher=Manchester UP|page=103|isbn=9780719038655}}</ref>  It was the only general strike in British history, as union leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]], who had coordinated the strike, considered it a mistake.
