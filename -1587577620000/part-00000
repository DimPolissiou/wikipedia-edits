Walt subsequently moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], where he became a high school chemistry teacher. ''Breaking Bad'' begins on Walt's 50th birthday, when he is diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|Stage IIIA]] [[lung cancer]]. After this discovery, he resorts to manufacturing [[methamphetamine]] and drug dealing with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]) to ensure his family's financial security after his death. He is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias \"Heisenberg\", which becomes recognizable as the kingpin figure in the local drug trade. Series creator [[Vince Gilligan]] has described his goal with Walter White as \"turning [[Goodbye, Mr Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]]\" and deliberately made the character less sympathetic over the course of the series. Walt's evolution from mild-mannered school teacher and family man to a ruthless criminal mastermind and murderer is the show's central focus.\n\nAlthough AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode \"[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]\", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walt's backstory, physical appearance, and personality traits.\n\nBoth the character and Cranston's performance have received critical acclaim, with White frequently being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]], three of them being consecutive, becoming the second actor to do so, after [[Bill Cosby]] for ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tom|last=O'Neal|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/03/breaking-bad-bryan-cranston-emmy-tv-news-story.html | title='Breaking Bad' tragedy: Bryan Cranston can't make Emmy history | date=March 14, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California| url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005171030/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/03/breaking-bad-bryan-cranston-emmy-tv-news-story.html | archivedate=October 5, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Following his fourth win, Cranston tied [[Dennis Franz]] for the most wins in the category's history.

As the premise of ''Breaking Bad'' was based on a humorous idea that he and his fellow writer from ''[[The X-Files]]'', [[Thomas Schnauz]] had come with of driving around in an RV making [[methamphetamine]], Gilligan made Walter a chemistry teacher and who, until the start of the show, would have never violated the law.<ref name=\"Segal0706\"/>\n\nGilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in a [[Drive (The X-Files)|sixth season]] episode of the science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', where Gilligan worked as a writer. Cranston played an [[anti-Semite]] with a terminal illness who took [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick.

When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own backstory for the character. At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline. He had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\". Cranston also repeatedly identified elements in scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and would go so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriter(s). Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his father for how Walt carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders\". In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\"/>\n\nGilligan has said it has been difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walt more and more unsympathetic. Gilligan said: \"He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist.

Walt is impressed by the monetary returns from the meth operation, and Hank offers to take him as a ride-along to a DEA bust. The next day, Walt faints at the car wash and is taken to a hospital; there, he is told he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die in two years. During the ride-along, Hank busts a [[crystal meth]] lab, taking cook Emilio Koyama (John Koyama) into custody. Walt sees Emilio's partner fleeing the scene; it is one of his former students, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]). Looking to secure his family's well-being by producing and selling meth, Walt tracks Jesse down and [[blackmail]]s him into selling the meth that Walt will cook. Walt gives Jesse his life savings to buy an [[recreational vehicle|RV]] that they can use as a [[rolling meth lab]].\n\nAfter their first cook in the RV, Jesse brings a sample of the extremely pure meth to distributor [[Domingo \"Krazy-8\" Molina]] (Max Arciniega), and then brings Krazy-8 and the now-released Emilio to see the cook site. Emilio recognizes Walt as accompanying the DEA during the bust, and believes he is an informant. Krazy-8 forces Walt to show them how he cooked such pure meth or be killed. Walt pretends to start a cook but instead produces toxic [[phosphine]] gas which kills Emilio and incapacitates Krazy-8. Walt and Jesse secure Krazy-8 to a structural post in Jesse's basement with a [[U-lock]] around his neck, and Walt struggles with the decision on whether to kill him. After Krazy-8 promises not to retaliate, Walt starts to unlock the lock to let Krazy-8 go, but sees him reach for a broken piece of plate to stab Walt with as soon as he was freed. Walt panics and [[garrote]]s him to death with the lock. The experience shakes Walt, and he tells Jesse he will not cook meth anymore.\n\nWalt eventually tells his family about his cancer diagnosis, and they urge him to undergo expensive [[chemotherapy]]. He initially does not want to go through the treatment, fearing that his family will remember him as a burden and a helpless invalid, much as he remembers his own father. Later he relents and agrees to undergo treatment, but refuses Gretchen and Elliot's offer to pay for it, choosing to re-enter the drug trade with Jesse. He shaves his head to hide his chemotherapy-induced hair loss.\n\nDissatisfied with Jesse's slow pace of selling the meth, Walt pushes him to sell it in bulk to local drug lord Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]), who has taken over Krazy-8's former territory. Discovering that Tuco stole the meth and savagely beat Jesse, Walt visits Tuco's lair with another bag of crystals, claiming to be \"Heisenberg\" (a reference to the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Werner Karl Heisenberg]]<ref name=\"talk\">{{cite episode | title=[[Talking Bad]] (episode 1) | series=[[Breaking Bad]] | credits=[[Chris Hardwick]], [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Julie Bowen]] | network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref>).  After Tuco mocks Jesse, refuses to pay for the bag, and implies that Walt will suffer the same fate as Jesse, Walt blows up part of the lair; the bag contained [[fulminated mercury]], not meth.  Impressed by the boldness of \"Heisenberg\", Tuco reluctantly agrees to pay for his meth upon delivery in the future.\n\nWalt revels in his success and adopts the Heisenberg alias in his business dealings going forward.  In order to make larger batches of meth to take advantage of their new arrangement with Tuco, Walt and Jesse switch from using [[pseudoephedrine]] to [[methylamine]] as a precursor. This tints their meth blue, which becomes a signature of Walt's product.  The pair begin to fear for their lives when, after testing the purity of the meth they delivered by snorting some of it, Tuco senselessly beats to death one of his own men, No-Doze (Cesar Garcia).\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWalt's \"blue meth\" becomes incredibly popular, to the point that Hank takes notice and raids Tuco's operation. A paranoid Tuco evades the bust, [[carjacking|carjacks]] Jesse, and kidnaps Walt.  He brings them to an isolated house in the desert, planning to take them deep into Mexico where they would be forced to cook their blue meth for the cartel. After a failed attempt to poison Tuco, they manage to escape on foot. Hank, who had been searching for Jesse, spots his car at the house and kills Tuco in a gunfight. Walt is arrested when he takes off all his clothes in a grocery store. He explains his disappearance by claiming that he had gone into a [[psychogenic fugue|fugue state]] as a result of his cancer medication and simply wandered off.\n\nWalt finds out that his cancer is in remission, and plans to leave the meth business again after selling the final 38&nbsp;lb (17&nbsp;kg) of meth.  He hires unscrupulous criminal attorney [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to cover his involvement in the drug trade and [[money laundering|launder]] his drug money. Seeing they need a new distributor to sell the large quantity of product they have remaining, Saul arranges a meeting at a local restaurant with a mysterious meth kingpin. Jesse shows up for the meeting high on [[heroin]], and leaves when the kingpin does not show. Walt realizes that the restaurant owner, [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) was the man they were supposed to meet. Under questioning by Walt, Gus explains that he was observing the pair, and refuses to work with them because Jesse is a drug addict. However, a few days later he gives Walt a chance to prove himself by delivering all the meth to a truck stop within an hour. Walt breaks into Jesse's apartment where the meth is stored, and finds him passed out with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]] ([[Krysten Ritter]]).  Walt finds the meth and makes the delivery on time, but misses the birth of his daughter. Jane blackmails Walt into giving Jesse his share of their drug money, after Walt initially refused due to Jesse's drug use.\n\nAfter talking to a stranger at a bar about family \u2013 not knowing that the man is Jane's father [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Donald Margolis|Donald]] ([[John de Lancie]]) \u2013 Walt again breaks into Jesse's apartment to find the lovers passed out in a heroin stupor. Jane rolls onto her back, vomits, and begins to choke. Walt does nothing to help her, and watches her die. Walt has Saul's [[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), clear any connection Jesse has to Jane's death, and convinces Jesse to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].\n\nWalt undergoes an operation to remove the remaining cancerous growth. Walt's anesthesia-induced references to a \"second cell phone\" \u2013 the one he uses to deal drugs \u2013 makes Skyler suspicious, leading her to uncover many of his lies and leave with their children. Just after her departure, two passenger planes collide directly above Walt's house; the accident was caused by Donald, who works as an [[air traffic control]]ler and was so overcome with grief that he was not paying attention to his work. Walt watches the accident in horror, unaware that he is indirectly responsible for it.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWalt decides to get out of the meth business, refusing Gus' offer to produce meth in a state-of-the-art laboratory hidden under an industrial laundry for a million dollars a month. Now separated from Skyler and living in an apartment, Walt admits to her that he has been financing his treatment by cooking meth. Horrified, Skyler asks for a divorce in return for her silence, and demands that Walt have nothing to do with their children.\n\nAfter he discovers Jesse is cooking and selling his own version of the blue meth, Walt agrees to cook his meth for Gus. He is assisted by accomplished chemist [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Gale Boetticher|Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]) and the business seems to be running smoothly. Jesse continues to cook his own version of the blue meth, with Skinny Pete and Badger as his distributors, but this leads to Hank nearly catching Jesse and Walt while he was following a lead on an RV he believed was being used to cook blue meth. To avoid being discovered hiding in the RV, Walt and Jesse, aided by Saul, place a phone call to distract Hank, making him believe his wife Marie has suffered a car accident. Hank decides to leave the pursuit of the RV only to find out that Marie is fine, allowing Walt and Jesse to dispose of the RV. This enrages Hank enough to badly beat up Jesse at his house and send him to the hospital. Jesse threatens Walt by telling him he\u2019ll press charges on Hank; he also tells Walt that if he\u2019s caught, he would make a deal to give up Heisenberg. Fearing that any of this will derail Hank\u2019s career in law enforcement, Walt is forced to convince Gus to hire Jesse to replace Gale as his assistant. He also agrees to share 50% of his earnings with Jesse.\n\nGambling that Skyler will not turn him in to the police due to the harm it would cause to their son, Walt returns to his house. After a few attempts at bluffing him, Skyler comes to uneasily accept the situation and helps Walt launder his drug money, but refuses to have anything to do with him outside of business. The rift in their marriage worsens when Skyler sleeps with her boss, Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]). Walt tries to get back at her by making a pass at the principal at his school, who puts him on indefinite suspension.\n\nTuco's cousins [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Marco and Leonel Salamanca]] ([[Luis Moncada|Luis]] and [[Daniel Moncada]]) seek revenge against those responsible for his death, and find out Walt's identity from their uncle [[Hector Salamanca]] ([[Mark Margolis]]). Believing that Walt betrayed Tuco, they go to his house and prepare to kill him with a silver axe. Gus discovers this, and to protect his investment in Walt, he convinces them to instead target Hank, who actually killed Tuco. The cousins die in the attempt on Hank's life, while Hank survives, but is temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Skyler strong-arms Walt into paying for Hank's care, and creates a cover story about Walt [[card counting|counting cards]] at casinos to explain how he made his money.\n\nWalt angers Gus by killing two of Gus' dealers in an attempt to protect Jesse, who had been planning to kill them himself for their murder of a child gang member. Gus responds by putting a hit on Jesse and re-hiring Gale as Walt's assistant, with the intention of replacing Walt as soon as possible.  Walt plots to kill Gale to avoid becoming disposable, but Gus' henchman Victor lures Walt to the laundry facility, where Mike is waiting to kill him. Walt frantically calls Jesse and tells him that he is about to be killed and Jesse will have to take out Gale himself. Victor rushes to Gale's house but finds him shot dead.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nIn the aftermath of Gale's murder, Mike holds Walt at the lab to await Gus' arrival. Victor arrives with Jesse, and proceeds to start the cook process himself to show Gus that Walt and Jesse are not indispensable. Gus, however, kills Victor in front of Mike, Walt, and Jesse, in a gruesome show of force. The tension of working under tighter security creates a rift between Walt and Jesse, and Gus uses the opportunity to bring Jesse to his side by having Mike train him. Walt deduces that Gus plans to eventually kill him and replace him with Jesse. He gives Jesse homemade [[ricin]] with which to poison Gus, but Jesse never goes through with it. Walt shows up at Jesse's house and tries to convince him to betray Gus, but Jesse refuses and tells Walt they are finished.\n\nMeanwhile, Skyler buys the car wash where Walt used to work and uses it to launder his drug money.  Hank suspects that Gus is involved in the blue meth business.  With the DEA skeptical and unable to drive due to his condition, he enlists Walt's help in the investigation as a driver and tracker.  Walt manages to sabotage the investigation, but Gus blames him nonetheless.\n\nGus rids himself of the Mexican cartel's influence in the area with the help of Mike and Jesse. He then fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's entire family if he causes any more trouble. Walt tries to use one of Saul's connections to get him and his family relocated, but finds that Skyler has used most of his drug money to pay off Ted Beneke's IRS fines to avoid having their own lives investigated. After arranging for Saul to report that Hank was being targeted for assassination again, so that his family would be protected by the DEA, Walt resolves to kill Gus.\n\nWhen Brock, the son of Jesse's new girlfriend Andrea, falls desperately ill with ricin-like symptoms, Jesse attacks Walt, believing that he poisoned him.  Walt manages to convince Jesse that Gus is the one responsible.  After an attempt to kill Gus with a car bomb fails, Walt discovers from Saul that Gus has been visiting Tuco's uncle Hector in his nursing home, to taunt him about the cartel's defeat and the end of the Salamanca family. Walt makes a deal with Hector to draw Gus in by setting up a meeting with the DEA. When Gus comes to the nursing home to kill Hector for turning informant, Hector detonates a pipe bomb Walt made, killing both himself and Gus. Walt rescues Jesse, who had been kept as a prisoner in the lab, and together they destroy all the evidence and torch the lab.\n\nAfter Brock recovers, Jesse learns that the boy had likely been poisoned by accidentally eating [[Lily of the Valley]] berries, not ricin. Walt responds that killing Gus was still the right thing to do. Walt calls Skyler to tell her they are safe and that he has \"won\", as the camera pans to a potted Lily of the Valley plant next to Walt's pool, indicating that Walt had in fact poisoned Brock to goad Jesse into action.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike attempts to kill Walt in retaliation for Gus' death, but Jesse intervenes and convinces the two men to work together to eliminate their connection to the destroyed lab.  The three eventually start a new meth production system with the help of a corrupt [[pest control]] company, using residents' homes to cook meth while they are fumigated, using methylamine provided by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle ([[Laura Fraser]]), a representative for the conglomerate that owned Gus's franchise. When her supply is discovered to be tracked by the police, she leaks them information on a train carrying the chemical so they can plan a robbery. The robbery is successful, but Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]), one of the pest control workers, kills a young boy who had seen them. Horrified, Jesse and Mike resolve to leave the business.  A [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] drug lord named Declan offers to buy out the operation for $15 million in order to remove his competition. Walt convinces him to pay off Jesse and Mike and begin distributing Walt's meth instead.\n\nHank connects Mike to the blue meth, and begins pressing several of his associates, who are now in prison, to give information on the blue meth operation.  When Walt delivers Mike's share of Declan's payment, Mike refuses to reveal these prisoners' identities and insults Walt, blaming him for all the problems they've encountered; Walt shoots him dead in a fit of rage. Obtaining a list of the prisoners from Lydia, he enlists Todd's uncle Jack ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]), a criminal with ties to the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] prison gang, to kill the nine men simultaneously at multiple prisons to prevent the DEA from realizing that they were being targeted until it was too late.\n\nAfter a few months, Walt has earned more than $80 million from meth, and Skyler convinces him to stop. Walter leaves the meth business, and the kids return home. During a family barbecue, Hank finds a copy of [[Walt Whitman]]'s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' in the bathroom, the same copy given to Walt by Gale; upon reading Gale's handwritten inscription referring to Walt as \"the other W.W.\" Hank realizes that Walt is the drug lord he has been pursuing. Hank accuses Walt of being Heisenberg, which a stunned Walt neither confirms nor denies. Walt says that his cancer is back and he will likely be dead in six months, making an arrest pointless. Hank says they can talk if Walt gives up his children, but Walt refuses and tells Hank to \"tread lightly\". Walt eventually forces Hank to remain silent by crafting a fake confessional videotape in which he states that Hank is Heisenberg.\n\nWalt buries his money in seven barrels on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]], and convinces Jesse to go into a relocation program. While waiting to be picked up, Jesse figures out that Walt poisoned Brock. Hank approaches Jesse and offers to help bring down Walt. With Hank's help, Jesse lures Walt into a trap by claiming to have found his money. Walt makes arrangements with Jack and his men to kill Jesse, in exchange for promising to help teach Todd how to cook meth. When Walt realizes Jesse is with Hank, he tries to call off the deal to protect Hank, but is subdued by Hank and his DEA partner Steven Gomez ([[Steven Michael Quezada]]). Just then, Jack and his men arrive and fire on the group, killing Gomez and wounding Hank; Jack then executes Hank, despite Walt pleading for his brother-in-law's life. Jack's men take all but one barrel of Walt's money and abduct Jesse; as Jesse is taken away, Walt spitefully tells him that he watched Jane die.\n\nWalt tries to persuade Skyler and Walter Jr. to go on the run with him, but they refuse. He kidnaps Holly, but has a moment of conscience and leaves her to be found and returned. He calls Skyler, knowing that the police are listening in, and berates her for failing to follow his orders, as a way of clearing her of involvement in his crimes. Walt then goes into hiding and is sent to live in isolation in [[New Hampshire]].\n\nAfter several months alone, Walt goes to a local bar, where he calls Walter Jr. and tries to give him money. Walter Jr. angrily rejects the gesture, however, and hangs up. Feeling hopeless, Walt calls the DEA and gives himself up. As he waits for them, however, he sees Gretchen and Elliott on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' downplaying his contributions to Gray Matter and resolves to return to Albuquerque to put things right.\n\nWhen Walter arrives in Albuquerque \u2013 on his 52nd birthday \u2013 he confronts Gretchen and Elliott at their home and intimidates them into putting his remaining money into a trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and provides her the location of Hank and Steve's unmarked grave which he suggests she use to barter for a deal with the prosecutor, and finally admits to her that he entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his daughter, Holly, one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, surreptitiously poisoning her drink with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously activating a remote machine gun mounted in his car that injures Jack and kills all of his men except for Todd. Jesse proceeds to strangle Todd to death, while Walt finishes off Jack by shooting him in the head. Walt asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been wounded by a ricocheted bullet. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die as a result of the poisoned drink she consumed. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment Jesse had been using, then collapses dead on the floor just as the police arrive.\n\n===''El Camino''===\n{{see also|El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie}}\nCranston reprises his role in the movie '' [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'' in a flashback scene, taking place during the events of \"[[4 Days Out]]\" from the show's second season. Walt and Jesse are sitting down at a buffet breakfast talking about how they are going to move a batch of recently cooked meth. Walt asks Jesse what he would like to study if he went to college and encourages Jesse to find a life outside of cooking meth in the future. He suggests that Jesse should study business and marketing, remarking that Jesse is a natural at it and that he \"could practically teach the class\" himself using his vast knowledge. Afterwards, Walt tells Jesse: \"You're really lucky, you know that? You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special.\"\n\nIn the present, Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger see various news reports on the aftermath of Walt's massacre. In a news report Jesse listens to, Walt is confirmed to be dead with the same report mentioning an investigation of a Houston woman poisoned by Walt \u2013 implied to be Lydia \u2013 who is in critical condition and not expected to survive.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Walter White, as well as Bryan Cranston's performance, has received near-universal acclaim, from both critics and audiences. Walter White is considered to be one of the greatest and most iconic characters in television history.\n\n===Reviews===\n\nThe web magazine ''[[Grantland]]'' quotes Andy Greenwald as analyzing Walter White differently from some others, including Vince Gilligan. Greenwald states:<ref>{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenwald |url=http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/85210/breaking-bad-season-5-episode-11-recap-cigs-lies-and-videotape-in-confessions |title=Breaking Bad Season 5, Episode 11 Recap: Cigs, Lies, and Videotape in 'Confessions' |website=Grantland |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040416/http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/85210/breaking-bad-season-5-episode-11-recap-cigs-lies-and-videotape-in-confessions |archivedate=August 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Since watching [the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode, \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\"], I've been thinking a lot about Walter White, the 'shadow' on his recent [[CAT scan]], and the black cloud that has long since overtaken his heart. The closer we get to the end, the more Walt scrabbles around and lashes out like a rat when it's surrounded, the less I'm buying Vince Gilligan's whole 'Mr. Chips to Scarface' quote as an analogy for Walt's transformation. That's the route the character has taken these five seasons, sure, in terms of his changing context. But I think the most horrifying part of ''Breaking Bad'' may be that Walt, at his core, didn't really transform at all. It wasn't greed or generosity or cancer or fear that fueled this reign of death and destruction. It was resentment. Seething, burning resentment, the kind that forms not due to poor treatment but due to an innate knowledge that you, the aggrieved, are better than said treatment, better than everyone who has somehow gotten the better of you over the years. ... Every moment Walt spent in front of a classroom he was thinking about how beneath him it all was. He was a genius; he was meant to be a millionaire, not this castrated cross between stepping stone and doormat. When you got down to it, Walt desperately wanted to teach every one ... a lesson, and I don't mean in the style of Mr. Chips.</blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, Scott Meslow wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that Walt's capacity for villainy was present well before the series even began, and that cancer was only the catalyst: \"all the elements that have since turned him into a monster were already in place.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Meslow|title=The Big Secret of 'Breaking Bad': Walter White Was Always a Bad Guy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-big-secret-of-breaking-bad-walter-white-was-always-a-bad-guy/261833/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=August 31, 2012|accessdate=May 3, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515174141/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-big-secret-of-breaking-bad-walter-white-was-always-a-bad-guy/261833/|archivedate=May 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine writer Emma Rosenblum said Bryan Cranston \"pulls off the unassuming White with flawless subtlety: a waxy pallor, a slump of the shoulders, and a sense of doom that is palpable\".<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' writer Tim Goodman praised as courageous Vince Gilligan's decision to transform Walter White into an unsympathetic character: \"You don't take your main character and make him unlikable.

Walt subsequently moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], where he became a high school chemistry teacher. ''Breaking Bad'' begins on Walt's 50th birthday, when he is diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|Stage IIIA]] [[lung cancer]]. After this discovery, he resorts to manufacturing [[methamphetamine]] and drug dealing with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]) to ensure his family's financial security after his death. He is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias \"Heisenberg\", which becomes recognizable as the kingpin figure in the local drug trade. Series creator [[Vince Gilligan]] has described his goal with Walter White as \"turning [[Goodbye, Mr Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]]\" and deliberately made the character less sympathetic over the course of the series. Walt's evolution from mild-mannered school teacher and family man to a ruthless criminal mastermind and murderer is the show's central focus.\n\nAlthough AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode \"[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]\", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walt's backstory, physical appearance, and personality traits.\n\nBoth the character and Cranston's performance have received critical acclaim, with White frequently being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]], three of them being consecutive, becoming the second actor to do so, after [[Bill Cosby]] for ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tom|last=O'Neal|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/03/breaking-bad-bryan-cranston-emmy-tv-news-story.html | title='Breaking Bad' tragedy: Bryan Cranston can't make Emmy history | date=March 14, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California| url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005171030/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/03/breaking-bad-bryan-cranston-emmy-tv-news-story.html | archivedate=October 5, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Following his fourth win, Cranston tied [[Dennis Franz]] for the most wins in the category's history.

As the premise of ''Breaking Bad'' was based on a humorous idea that he and his fellow writer from ''[[The X-Files]]'', [[Thomas Schnauz]] had come with of driving around in an RV making [[methamphetamine]], Gilligan made Walter a chemistry teacher and who, until the start of the show, would have never violated the law.<ref name=\"Segal0706\"/>\n\nGilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in a [[Drive (The X-Files)|sixth season]] episode of the science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', where Gilligan worked as a writer. Cranston played an [[anti-Semite]] with a terminal illness who took [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick.

When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own backstory for the character. At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline. He had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\". Cranston also repeatedly identified elements in scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and would go so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriter(s). Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his father for how Walt carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders\". In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\"/>\n\nGilligan has said it has been difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walt more and more unsympathetic.

Walt is impressed by the monetary returns from the meth operation, and Hank offers to take him as a ride-along to a DEA bust. The next day, Walt faints at the car wash and is taken to a hospital; there, he is told he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die in two years. During the ride-along, Hank busts a [[crystal meth]] lab, taking cook Emilio Koyama (John Koyama) into custody. Walt sees Emilio's partner fleeing the scene; it is one of his former students, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]). Looking to secure his family's well-being by producing and selling meth, Walt tracks Jesse down and [[blackmail]]s him into selling the meth that Walt will cook. Walt gives Jesse his life savings to buy an [[recreational vehicle|RV]] that they can use as a [[rolling meth lab]].\n\nAfter their first cook in the RV, Jesse brings a sample of the extremely pure meth to distributor [[Domingo \"Krazy-8\" Molina]] (Max Arciniega), and then brings Krazy-8 and the now-released Emilio to see the cook site. Emilio recognizes Walt as accompanying the DEA during the bust, and believes he is an informant. Krazy-8 forces Walt to show them how he cooked such pure meth or be killed. Walt pretends to start a cook but instead produces toxic [[phosphine]] gas which kills Emilio and incapacitates Krazy-8. Walt and Jesse secure Krazy-8 to a structural post in Jesse's basement with a [[U-lock]] around his neck, and Walt struggles with the decision on whether to kill him. After Krazy-8 promises not to retaliate, Walt starts to unlock the lock to let Krazy-8 go, but sees him reach for a broken piece of plate to stab Walt with as soon as he was freed. Walt panics and [[garrote]]s him to death with the lock. The experience shakes Walt, and he tells Jesse he will not cook meth anymore.\n\nWalt eventually tells his family about his cancer diagnosis, and they urge him to undergo expensive [[chemotherapy]]. He initially does not want to go through the treatment, fearing that his family will remember him as a burden and a helpless invalid, much as he remembers his own father. Later he relents and agrees to undergo treatment, but refuses Gretchen and Elliot's offer to pay for it, choosing to re-enter the drug trade with Jesse. He shaves his head to hide his chemotherapy-induced hair loss.\n\nDissatisfied with Jesse's slow pace of selling the meth, Walt pushes him to sell it in bulk to local drug lord Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]), who has taken over Krazy-8's former territory. Discovering that Tuco stole the meth and savagely beat Jesse, Walt visits Tuco's lair with another bag of crystals, claiming to be \"Heisenberg\" (a reference to the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Werner Karl Heisenberg]]<ref name=\"talk\">{{cite episode | title=[[Talking Bad]] (episode 1) | series=[[Breaking Bad]] | credits=[[Chris Hardwick]], [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Julie Bowen]] | network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | airdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref>).  After Tuco mocks Jesse, refuses to pay for the bag, and implies that Walt will suffer the same fate as Jesse, Walt blows up part of the lair; the bag contained [[fulminated mercury]], not meth.  Impressed by the boldness of \"Heisenberg\", Tuco reluctantly agrees to pay for his meth upon delivery in the future.\n\nWalt revels in his success and adopts the Heisenberg alias in his business dealings going forward.  In order to make larger batches of meth to take advantage of their new arrangement with Tuco, Walt and Jesse switch from using [[pseudoephedrine]] to [[methylamine]] as a precursor. This tints their meth blue, which becomes a signature of Walt's product.  The pair begin to fear for their lives when, after testing the purity of the meth they delivered by snorting some of it, Tuco senselessly beats to death one of his own men, No-Doze (Cesar Garcia).\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWalt's \"blue meth\" becomes incredibly popular, to the point that Hank takes notice and raids Tuco's operation. A paranoid Tuco evades the bust, [[carjacking|carjacks]] Jesse, and kidnaps Walt.  He brings them to an isolated house in the desert, planning to take them deep into Mexico where they would be forced to cook their blue meth for the cartel. After a failed attempt to poison Tuco, they manage to escape on foot. Hank, who had been searching for Jesse, spots his car at the house and kills Tuco in a gunfight. Walt is arrested when he takes off all his clothes in a grocery store. He explains his disappearance by claiming that he had gone into a [[psychogenic fugue|fugue state]] as a result of his cancer medication and simply wandered off.\n\nWalt finds out that his cancer is in remission, and plans to leave the meth business again after selling the final 38&nbsp;lb (17&nbsp;kg) of meth.  He hires unscrupulous criminal attorney [[Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)|Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to cover his involvement in the drug trade and [[money laundering|launder]] his drug money. Seeing they need a new distributor to sell the large quantity of product they have remaining, Saul arranges a meeting at a local restaurant with a mysterious meth kingpin. Jesse shows up for the meeting high on [[heroin]], and leaves when the kingpin does not show. Walt realizes that the restaurant owner, [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) was the man they were supposed to meet. Under questioning by Walt, Gus explains that he was observing the pair, and refuses to work with them because Jesse is a drug addict. However, a few days later he gives Walt a chance to prove himself by delivering all the meth to a truck stop within an hour. Walt breaks into Jesse's apartment where the meth is stored, and finds him passed out with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]] ([[Krysten Ritter]]).  Walt finds the meth and makes the delivery on time, but misses the birth of his daughter. Jane blackmails Walt into giving Jesse his share of their drug money, after Walt initially refused due to Jesse's drug use.\n\nAfter talking to a stranger at a bar about family \u2013 not knowing that the man is Jane's father [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Donald Margolis|Donald]] ([[John de Lancie]]) \u2013 Walt again breaks into Jesse's apartment to find the lovers passed out in a heroin stupor. Jane rolls onto her back, vomits, and begins to choke. Walt does nothing to help her, and watches her die. Walt has Saul's [[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), clear any connection Jesse has to Jane's death, and convinces Jesse to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].\n\nWalt undergoes an operation to remove the remaining cancerous growth. Walt's anesthesia-induced references to a \"second cell phone\" \u2013 the one he uses to deal drugs \u2013 makes Skyler suspicious, leading her to uncover many of his lies and leave with their children. Just after her departure, two passenger planes collide directly above Walt's house; the accident was caused by Donald, who works as an [[air traffic control]]ler and was so overcome with grief that he was not paying attention to his work. Walt watches the accident in horror, unaware that he is indirectly responsible for it.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWalt decides to get out of the meth business, refusing Gus' offer to produce meth in a state-of-the-art laboratory hidden under an industrial laundry for a million dollars a month. Now separated from Skyler and living in an apartment, Walt admits to her that he has been financing his treatment by cooking meth. Horrified, Skyler asks for a divorce in return for her silence, and demands that Walt have nothing to do with their children.\n\nAfter he discovers Jesse is cooking and selling his own version of the blue meth, Walt agrees to cook his meth for Gus. He is assisted by accomplished chemist [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Gale Boetticher|Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]) and the business seems to be running smoothly. Jesse continues to cook his own version of the blue meth, with Skinny Pete and Badger as his distributors, but this leads to Hank nearly catching Jesse and Walt while he was following a lead on an RV he believed was being used to cook blue meth. To avoid being discovered hiding in the RV, Walt and Jesse, aided by Saul, place a phone call to distract Hank, making him believe his wife Marie has suffered a car accident. Hank decides to leave the pursuit of the RV only to find out that Marie is fine, allowing Walt and Jesse to dispose of the RV. This enrages Hank enough to badly beat up Jesse at his house and send him to the hospital. Jesse threatens Walt by telling him he\u2019ll press charges on Hank; he also tells Walt that if he\u2019s caught, he would make a deal to give up Heisenberg. Fearing that any of this will derail Hank\u2019s career in law enforcement, Walt is forced to convince Gus to hire Jesse to replace Gale as his assistant. He also agrees to share 50% of his earnings with Jesse.\n\nGambling that Skyler will not turn him in to the police due to the harm it would cause to their son, Walt returns to his house. After a few attempts at bluffing him, Skyler comes to uneasily accept the situation and helps Walt launder his drug money, but refuses to have anything to do with him outside of business. The rift in their marriage worsens when Skyler sleeps with her boss, Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]). Walt tries to get back at her by making a pass at the principal at his school, who puts him on indefinite suspension.\n\nTuco's cousins [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Marco and Leonel Salamanca]] ([[Luis Moncada|Luis]] and [[Daniel Moncada]]) seek revenge against those responsible for his death, and find out Walt's identity from their uncle [[Hector Salamanca]] ([[Mark Margolis]]). Believing that Walt betrayed Tuco, they go to his house and prepare to kill him with a silver axe. Gus discovers this, and to protect his investment in Walt, he convinces them to instead target Hank, who actually killed Tuco. The cousins die in the attempt on Hank's life, while Hank survives, but is temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Skyler strong-arms Walt into paying for Hank's care, and creates a cover story about Walt [[card counting|counting cards]] at casinos to explain how he made his money.\n\nWalt angers Gus by killing two of Gus' dealers in an attempt to protect Jesse, who had been planning to kill them himself for their murder of a child gang member. Gus responds by putting a hit on Jesse and re-hiring Gale as Walt's assistant, with the intention of replacing Walt as soon as possible.  Walt plots to kill Gale to avoid becoming disposable, but Gus' henchman Victor lures Walt to the laundry facility, where Mike is waiting to kill him. Walt frantically calls Jesse and tells him that he is about to be killed and Jesse will have to take out Gale himself. Victor rushes to Gale's house but finds him shot dead.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nIn the aftermath of Gale's murder, Mike holds Walt at the lab to await Gus' arrival. Victor arrives with Jesse, and proceeds to start the cook process himself to show Gus that Walt and Jesse are not indispensable. Gus, however, kills Victor in front of Mike, Walt, and Jesse, in a gruesome show of force. The tension of working under tighter security creates a rift between Walt and Jesse, and Gus uses the opportunity to bring Jesse to his side by having Mike train him. Walt deduces that Gus plans to eventually kill him and replace him with Jesse. He gives Jesse homemade [[ricin]] with which to poison Gus, but Jesse never goes through with it. Walt shows up at Jesse's house and tries to convince him to betray Gus, but Jesse refuses and tells Walt they are finished.\n\nMeanwhile, Skyler buys the car wash where Walt used to work and uses it to launder his drug money.  Hank suspects that Gus is involved in the blue meth business.  With the DEA skeptical and unable to drive due to his condition, he enlists Walt's help in the investigation as a driver and tracker.  Walt manages to sabotage the investigation, but Gus blames him nonetheless.\n\nGus rids himself of the Mexican cartel's influence in the area with the help of Mike and Jesse. He then fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's entire family if he causes any more trouble. Walt tries to use one of Saul's connections to get him and his family relocated, but finds that Skyler has used most of his drug money to pay off Ted Beneke's IRS fines to avoid having their own lives investigated. After arranging for Saul to report that Hank was being targeted for assassination again, so that his family would be protected by the DEA, Walt resolves to kill Gus.\n\nWhen Brock, the son of Jesse's new girlfriend Andrea, falls desperately ill with ricin-like symptoms, Jesse attacks Walt, believing that he poisoned him.  Walt manages to convince Jesse that Gus is the one responsible.  After an attempt to kill Gus with a car bomb fails, Walt discovers from Saul that Gus has been visiting Tuco's uncle Hector in his nursing home, to taunt him about the cartel's defeat and the end of the Salamanca family. Walt makes a deal with Hector to draw Gus in by setting up a meeting with the DEA. When Gus comes to the nursing home to kill Hector for turning informant, Hector detonates a pipe bomb Walt made, killing both himself and Gus. Walt rescues Jesse, who had been kept as a prisoner in the lab, and together they destroy all the evidence and torch the lab.\n\nAfter Brock recovers, Jesse learns that the boy had likely been poisoned by accidentally eating [[Lily of the Valley]] berries, not ricin. Walt responds that killing Gus was still the right thing to do. Walt calls Skyler to tell her they are safe and that he has \"won\", as the camera pans to a potted Lily of the Valley plant next to Walt's pool, indicating that Walt had in fact poisoned Brock to goad Jesse into action.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike attempts to kill Walt in retaliation for Gus' death, but Jesse intervenes and convinces the two men to work together to eliminate their connection to the destroyed lab.  The three eventually start a new meth production system with the help of a corrupt [[pest control]] company, using residents' homes to cook meth while they are fumigated, using methylamine provided by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle ([[Laura Fraser]]), a representative for the conglomerate that owned Gus's franchise. When her supply is discovered to be tracked by the police, she leaks them information on a train carrying the chemical so they can plan a robbery. The robbery is successful, but Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]), one of the pest control workers, kills a young boy who had seen them. Horrified, Jesse and Mike resolve to leave the business.  A [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] drug lord named Declan offers to buy out the operation for $15 million in order to remove his competition. Walt convinces him to pay off Jesse and Mike and begin distributing Walt's meth instead.\n\nHank connects Mike to the blue meth, and begins pressing several of his associates, who are now in prison, to give information on the blue meth operation.  When Walt delivers Mike's share of Declan's payment, Mike refuses to reveal these prisoners' identities and insults Walt, blaming him for all the problems they've encountered; Walt shoots him dead in a fit of rage. Obtaining a list of the prisoners from Lydia, he enlists Todd's uncle Jack ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]), a criminal with ties to the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] prison gang, to kill the nine men simultaneously at multiple prisons to prevent the DEA from realizing that they were being targeted until it was too late.\n\nAfter a few months, Walt has earned more than $80 million from meth, and Skyler convinces him to stop. Walter leaves the meth business, and the kids return home. During a family barbecue, Hank finds a copy of [[Walt Whitman]]'s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' in the bathroom, the same copy given to Walt by Gale; upon reading Gale's handwritten inscription referring to Walt as \"the other W.W.\" Hank realizes that Walt is the drug lord he has been pursuing. Hank accuses Walt of being Heisenberg, which a stunned Walt neither confirms nor denies. Walt says that his cancer is back and he will likely be dead in six months, making an arrest pointless. Hank says they can talk if Walt gives up his children, but Walt refuses and tells Hank to \"tread lightly\". Walt eventually forces Hank to remain silent by crafting a fake confessional videotape in which he states that Hank is Heisenberg.\n\nWalt buries his money in seven barrels on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]], and convinces Jesse to go into a relocation program. While waiting to be picked up, Jesse figures out that Walt poisoned Brock. Hank approaches Jesse and offers to help bring down Walt. With Hank's help, Jesse lures Walt into a trap by claiming to have found his money. Walt makes arrangements with Jack and his men to kill Jesse, in exchange for promising to help teach Todd how to cook meth. When Walt realizes Jesse is with Hank, he tries to call off the deal to protect Hank, but is subdued by Hank and his DEA partner Steven Gomez ([[Steven Michael Quezada]]). Just then, Jack and his men arrive and fire on the group, killing Gomez and wounding Hank; Jack then executes Hank, despite Walt pleading for his brother-in-law's life. Jack's men take all but one barrel of Walt's money and abduct Jesse; as Jesse is taken away, Walt spitefully tells him that he watched Jane die.\n\nWalt tries to persuade Skyler and Walter Jr. to go on the run with him, but they refuse. He kidnaps Holly, but has a moment of conscience and leaves her to be found and returned. He calls Skyler, knowing that the police are listening in, and berates her for failing to follow his orders, as a way of clearing her of involvement in his crimes. Walt then goes into hiding and is sent to live in isolation in [[New Hampshire]].\n\nAfter several months alone, Walt goes to a local bar, where he calls Walter Jr. and tries to give him money. Walter Jr. angrily rejects the gesture, however, and hangs up. Feeling hopeless, Walt calls the DEA and gives himself up. As he waits for them, however, he sees Gretchen and Elliott on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' downplaying his contributions to Gray Matter and resolves to return to Albuquerque to put things right.\n\nWhen Walter arrives in Albuquerque \u2013 on his 52nd birthday \u2013 he confronts Gretchen and Elliott at their home and intimidates them into putting his remaining money into a trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and provides her the location of Hank and Steve's unmarked grave which he suggests she use to barter for a deal with the prosecutor, and finally admits to her that he entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his daughter, Holly, one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, surreptitiously poisoning her drink with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously activating a remote machine gun mounted in his car that injures Jack and kills all of his men except for Todd. Jesse proceeds to strangle Todd to death, while Walt finishes off Jack by shooting him in the head. Walt asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been wounded by a ricocheted bullet. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die as a result of the poisoned drink she consumed. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment Jesse had been using, then collapses dead on the floor just as the police arrive.\n\n===''El Camino''===\n{{see also|El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie}}\nCranston reprises his role in the movie '' [[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'' in a flashback scene, taking place during the events of \"[[4 Days Out]]\" from the show's second season. Walt and Jesse are sitting down at a buffet breakfast talking about how they are going to move a batch of recently cooked meth. Walt asks Jesse what he would like to study if he went to college and encourages Jesse to find a life outside of cooking meth in the future. He suggests that Jesse should study business and marketing, remarking that Jesse is a natural at it and that he \"could practically teach the class\" himself using his vast knowledge. Afterwards, Walt tells Jesse: \"You're really lucky, you know that? You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special.\"\n\nIn the present, Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger see various news reports on the aftermath of Walt's massacre. In a news report Jesse listens to, Walt is confirmed to be dead with the same report mentioning an investigation of a Houston woman poisoned by Walt \u2013 implied to be Lydia \u2013 who is in critical condition and not expected to survive.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Walter White, as well as Bryan Cranston's performance, has received near-universal acclaim, from both critics and audiences. Walter White is considered to be one of the greatest and most iconic characters in television history.\n\n===Reviews===\n\nThe web magazine ''[[Grantland]]'' quotes Andy Greenwald as analyzing Walter White differently from some others, including Vince Gilligan. Greenwald states:<ref>{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenwald |url=http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/85210/breaking-bad-season-5-episode-11-recap-cigs-lies-and-videotape-in-confessions |title=Breaking Bad Season 5, Episode 11 Recap: Cigs, Lies, and Videotape in 'Confessions' |website=Grantland |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040416/http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/85210/breaking-bad-season-5-episode-11-recap-cigs-lies-and-videotape-in-confessions |archivedate=August 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Since watching [the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode, \"[[Confessions (Breaking Bad)|Confessions]]\"], I've been thinking a lot about Walter White, the 'shadow' on his recent [[CAT scan]], and the black cloud that has long since overtaken his heart. The closer we get to the end, the more Walt scrabbles around and lashes out like a rat when it's surrounded, the less I'm buying Vince Gilligan's whole 'Mr. Chips to Scarface' quote as an analogy for Walt's transformation. That's the route the character has taken these five seasons, sure, in terms of his changing context. But I think the most horrifying part of ''Breaking Bad'' may be that Walt, at his core, didn't really transform at all. It wasn't greed or generosity or cancer or fear that fueled this reign of death and destruction. It was resentment. Seething, burning resentment, the kind that forms not due to poor treatment but due to an innate knowledge that you, the aggrieved, are better than said treatment, better than everyone who has somehow gotten the better of you over the years. ... Every moment Walt spent in front of a classroom he was thinking about how beneath him it all was. He was a genius; he was meant to be a millionaire, not this castrated cross between stepping stone and doormat. When you got down to it, Walt desperately wanted to teach every one ... a lesson, and I don't mean in the style of Mr. Chips.</blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, Scott Meslow wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that Walt's capacity for villainy was present well before the series even began, and that cancer was only the catalyst: \"all the elements that have since turned him into a monster were already in place.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Meslow|title=The Big Secret of 'Breaking Bad': Walter White Was Always a Bad Guy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-big-secret-of-breaking-bad-walter-white-was-always-a-bad-guy/261833/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=August 31, 2012|accessdate=May 3, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515174141/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-big-secret-of-breaking-bad-walter-white-was-always-a-bad-guy/261833/|archivedate=May 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine writer Emma Rosenblum said Bryan Cranston \"pulls off the unassuming White with flawless subtlety: a waxy pallor, a slump of the shoulders, and a sense of doom that is palpable\".<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' writer Tim Goodman praised as courageous Vince Gilligan's decision to transform Walter White into an unsympathetic character: \"You don't take your main character and make him unlikable.
