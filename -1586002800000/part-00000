It also highlights the influence Divine Mercy played in the life in the young Wojty\u0142a. [[George Weigel]] explains that this devotion culminated years later in his second [[Encyclical]] entitled ''[[Dives in Misericordia]]'' (or ''Rich in Mercy'').<ref>{{cite website |title= Dives in Misericoria|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia.html}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Weigel are John Allen, a Vatican Journalist, and [[Andrzej Duda]], the President of [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite website |title=The Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy_The Face of Mercy |url=https://www.sisterfaustina.com/faceofmercy.html?viewfullsite=1}}</ref> They both tell of their unique perspectives on Divine Mercy, putting it in even more significant historical context.\n\n===Theology===\nLead by [[Scott Hahn]], [[Marc Ouellet|Cardinal Marc Ouellet]], Fr. Michael Gaitley, [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Cardinal Se\u00e1n O'Malley]], and Fr. Seraphim Michalenko, the film uncovers the depth of the message St. Faustina received from Jesus. The \"Face of Mercy\" is the face of Jesus himself, because Jesus is [[Charity (virtue)|Love]] incarnate. Furthermore, Weigel articulates the message of John Paul II's ''Dives in Misericordia'' saying, \"In Christ we meet the Merciful face of the Father and the Truth about our Humanity.\"<ref>[https://watch.formed.org/the-face-of-mercy-narrated-by-jim-caviezel/videos/the-face-of-mercy-narrated-by-jim-caviezel \"''The Face of Mercy''\"] on ''Formed''</ref> Thus, Divine Mercy, the Face of Mercy, the face of Jesus, is the proper remedy for the atrocities of the 20th and 21st Centuries. This is clearly what John Paul the Great believed, for, when he became [[Pope]], he instituted [[Divine Mercy Sunday]]. Furthermore, the first saint he canonized in the [[21st Century]] was St. Faustina!<ref>{{cite website |title=St. Faustina in Film |url=https://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/st.-faustina-in-film}}</ref>\n\n===Testimonials===\nThere are a plethora of testimonials in this documentary. \"These moving testimonies will remind us all that Divine Mercy is not just a devotion of the past or some abstract theology \u2013 it is alive, it is present, and it will transform the world.\"<ref name=FOMfilm /> They include, but aren't limited to those of:\n* Maureen Digan, who had [[Lymphedema]], which is a fatal cancer which causes swelling in the limbs.

She prayed the [[Divine Mercy Chaplet]] continuously (40 times each day) for weeks when the [[genocide]] was occurring. She was miraculously never found by [[Hutu]] soldiers. In her book, ''Left to Tell'', she describes how she realized that she too had to have mercy, especially on those who killed her family members;<ref>{{cite website |title=Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust |url=https://www.amazon.com/Left-Tell-Discovering-Rwandan-Holocaust/dp/1401908977}}</ref>\n* Eric Mahl, a former [[NFL]] [[linebacker]] who gave up his career to teach the homeless about Divine Mercy and the Love of Christ;\n* A [[Nun]] who was influenced by the letters of St. Faustina and Divine Mercy;\n* Fr.

[[George Weigel]] explains that this devotion culminated years later in his second [[Encyclical]] entitled ''[[Dives in Misericordia]]'' (or ''Rich in Mercy'').<ref>{{cite website |title= Dives in Misericoria|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia.html}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Weigel are John Allen, a Vatican Journalist, and [[Andrzej Duda]], the President of [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite website |title=The Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy_The Face of Mercy |url=https://www.sisterfaustina.com/faceofmercy.html?viewfullsite=1}}</ref> They both tell of their unique perspectives on Divine Mercy, putting it in even more significant historical context.\n\n===Theology===\nLead by [[Scott Hahn]], [[Marc Ouellet|Cardinal Marc Ouellet]], Fr. Michael Gaitley, [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Cardinal Se\u00e1n O'Malley]], and Fr. Seraphim Michalenko, the film uncovers the depth of the message St. Faustina received from Jesus. The \"Face of Mercy\" is the face of Jesus himself, because Jesus is [[Charity (virtue)|Love]] incarnate. Furthermore, Weigel articulates the message of John Paul II's ''Dives in Misericordia'' saying, \"In Christ we meet the Merciful face of the Father and the Truth about our Humanity.\"<ref>[https://watch.formed.org/the-face-of-mercy-narrated-by-jim-caviezel/videos/the-face-of-mercy-narrated-by-jim-caviezel \"''The Face of Mercy''\"] on ''Formed''</ref> Thus, Divine Mercy, the Face of Mercy, the face of Jesus, is the proper remedy for the atrocities of the 20th and 21st Centuries. This is clearly what John Paul the Great believed, for, when he became [[Pope]], he instituted [[Divine Mercy Sunday]]. Furthermore, the first saint he canonized in the [[21st Century]] was St. Faustina!<ref>{{cite website |title=St. Faustina in Film |url=https://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/st.-faustina-in-film}}</ref>\n\n===Testimonials===\nThere are a plethora of testimonials in this documentary. \"These moving testimonies will remind us all that Divine Mercy is not just a devotion of the past or some abstract theology \u2013 it is alive, it is present, and it will transform the world.\"<ref name=FOMfilm /> They include, but aren't limited to those of:\n* Maureen Digan, who had [[Lymphedema]], which is a fatal cancer which causes swelling in the limbs.

She prayed the [[Divine Mercy Chaplet]] continuously (40 times each day) for weeks when the [[genocide]] was occurring. She was miraculously never found by [[Hutu]] soldiers. In her book, ''Left to Tell'', she describes how she realized that she too had to have mercy, especially on those who killed her family members;<ref>{{cite website |title=Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust |url=https://www.amazon.com/Left-Tell-Discovering-Rwandan-Holocaust/dp/1401908977}}</ref>\n* Eric Mahl, a former [[NFL]] [[linebacker]] who gave up his career to teach the homeless about Divine Mercy and the Love of Christ;\n* A [[Nun]] who was influenced by the letters of St. Faustina and Divine Mercy;\n* Fr.

The element or compound passes through the membrane filter and diffusive gel and is assimilated by the binding gel in a rate-controlled manner. Post-deployment analysis of the binding gel can be used to determine the bulk solution [[concentration]] of the element or compound via a simple equation.\n[[File:DGT theory.png|thumb|right|300 px|According to DGT theory, the concentration of an analyte, [C],  tends toward 0 (\u00b5g/L, ng/L, etc.) as the analyte approaches the binding layer, passing through the diffusive boundary layer (DBL, \u1e9f) and the DGT device's diffusive gel (thickness of \u0394g). No reverse diffusion of the analyte back into the solution is assumed to occur.]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe DGT technique was developed in 1994 by Hao Zhang and William Davison at the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]] of [[Lancaster University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The technique was first used to detect [[Metals|metal]] [[cations]] in [[Ocean|marine]] environments using [[Chelex 100]] as the binding agent. Further characterisation of DGT, including the results of field deployments in the [[Menai Strait]] and the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], was published in 1995.<ref>{{cite

houses a binding [[gel]], [[Diffusion|diffusive]] gel and [[Membrane technology|membrane filter]]. The element or compound passes through the membrane filter and diffusive gel and is assimilated by the binding gel in a rate-controlled manner. Post-deployment analysis of the binding gel can be used to determine the bulk solution [[concentration]] of the element or compound via a simple equation.\n[[File:DGT theory.png|thumb|right|300 px|According to DGT theory, the concentration of an analyte, [C],  tends toward 0 (\u00b5g/L, ng/L, etc.) as the analyte approaches the binding layer, passing through the diffusive boundary layer (DBL, \u1e9f) and the DGT device's diffusive gel (thickness of \u0394g). No reverse diffusion of the analyte back into the solution is assumed to occur.]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe DGT technique was developed in 1994 by Hao Zhang and William Davison at the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]] of [[Lancaster University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The technique was first used to detect [[Metals|metal]] [[cations]] in [[Ocean|marine]] environments using [[Chelex 100]] as the binding agent.

He was involved in a [[British political scandals|political scandal]] involving budget leaks.\n\n==Early career and trade union activities==\nThomas was born in [[Newport, Monmouthshire]], the son of a young unmarried mother. He was raised by his grandmother and began work at twelve years of age, soon starting a career as a railway worker. He became an official of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]] and in 1913 helped to organise its merger with two smaller trade unions on the railways to form the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (now part of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]]). Thomas was elected NUR general secretary in 1916,<ref name=odnb1>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=54|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=342\u20133|isbn=0-19-861404-7|first=Philip|last=Williamson|chapter=Thomas, James Henry|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref> a post he held until 1931.\n\nThomas was general secretary during the successful national rail strike of 1919 that was jointly called by the NUR and [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]] against proposed wage reductions. In 1921 Thomas played a leading role in the [[Black Friday (1921)|Black Friday]] crisis, in which rail and [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport unions]] failed to come to the aid of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|mineworkers]], who were facing wage reductions. Before the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]] the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] asked Thomas to negotiate with [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Conservative Government 1924\u20131929|Conservative Government]], but the talks were unsuccessful and the strike went ahead.\n\n==Political career==\n<!--[[File:JH Thomas cigarette card.jpg|thumb|right|Cigarette card from 1926 depicting Thomas]]-->Thomas began his political career as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] local [[councillor]] for [[Swindon]]. He was elected to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1910 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], replacing [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]]. He was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in the incoming [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of 1924 under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. In the second Labour government of 1929 Thomas was made [[Lord Privy Seal]] with special responsibility for employment. He became [[Secretary of State for the Dominions]] in 1930 and retained that position in Ramsay MacDonald's [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] (1931\u20131935). As a result of joining the National Government he was expelled from the Labour Party and the NUR. For the first few months of the National Government in 1931 he also served as Colonial Secretary once more. One of the problems he had to cope with was the Australian cricket [[bodyline]] affair, which he said was one of the most difficult he faced.\n\nThomas served as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] once more from 1935 until May 1936, when he was forced to resign from politics. It was revealed that he had been entertained by [[London Stock Exchange|stock exchange]] speculators and had dropped heavy hints as to tax changes planned in the budget. For example, while playing golf, he shouted \"[[Tee|Tee up!]]\", which was taken as a suggestion that the duties on tea were to rise.\n\n==Personal life==\nThomas was made a Freeman of Newport in 1924. In May 2011 a casket given to him to celebrate the occasion was purchased at auction for [[Newport Museum]].<ref>[http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9133219.Historic_freedom_casket_returns_to_Newport/ Historic casket returns to Newport]</ref>\n\nDespite his humble origins he had a reputation for mixing well with all levels of society. Among the Labour ministers he was a favourite with [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]<ref name=odnb1/> It was from laughing at a bawdy joke Thomas told the king that the latter split a post-operative wound from lung abscess surgery, delaying his recovery to near the 1929 General Election.<ref name=odnb21>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=21|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=875|isbn=0-19-861371-7|chapter=George V|first=H.

He was involved in a [[British political scandals|political scandal]] involving budget leaks.\n\n==Early career and trade union activities==\nThomas was born in [[Newport, Monmouthshire]], the son of a young unmarried mother. He was raised by his grandmother and began work at twelve years of age, soon starting a career as a railway worker. He became an official of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]] and in 1913 helped to organise its merger with two smaller trade unions on the railways to form the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (now part of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]]). Thomas was elected NUR general secretary in 1916,<ref name=odnb1>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=54|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=342\u20133|isbn=0-19-861404-7|first=Philip|last=Williamson|chapter=Thomas, James Henry|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref> a post he held until 1931.\n\nThomas was general secretary during the successful national rail strike of 1919 that was jointly called by the NUR and [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]] against proposed wage reductions. In 1921 Thomas played a leading role in the [[Black Friday (1921)|Black Friday]] crisis, in which rail and [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport unions]] failed to come to the aid of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|mineworkers]], who were facing wage reductions. Before the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]] the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] asked Thomas to negotiate with [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Conservative Government 1924\u20131929|Conservative Government]], but the talks were unsuccessful and the strike went ahead.\n\n==Political career==\n<!--[[File:JH Thomas cigarette card.jpg|thumb|right|Cigarette card from 1926 depicting Thomas]]-->Thomas began his political career as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] local [[councillor]] for [[Swindon]]. He was elected to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1910 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Derby]], replacing [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]]. He was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in the incoming [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of 1924 under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. In the second Labour government of 1929 Thomas was made [[Lord Privy Seal]] with special responsibility for employment. He became [[Secretary of State for the Dominions]] in 1930 and retained that position in Ramsay MacDonald's [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] (1931\u20131935). As a result of joining the National Government he was expelled from the Labour Party and the NUR. For the first few months of the National Government in 1931 he also served as Colonial Secretary once more. One of the problems he had to cope with was the Australian cricket [[bodyline]] affair, which he said was one of the most difficult he faced.\n\nThomas served as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] once more from 1935 until May 1936, when he was forced to resign from politics. It was revealed that he had been entertained by [[London Stock Exchange|stock exchange]] speculators and had dropped heavy hints as to tax changes planned in the budget. For example, while playing golf, he shouted \"[[Tee|Tee up!]]\", which was taken as a suggestion that the duties on tea were to rise.\n\n==Personal life==\nThomas was made a Freeman of Newport in 1924. In May 2011 a casket given to him to celebrate the occasion was purchased at auction for [[Newport Museum]].<ref>[http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9133219.Historic_freedom_casket_returns_to_Newport/ Historic casket returns to Newport]</ref>\n\nDespite his humble origins he had a reputation for mixing well with all levels of society.

They lived in makeshift huts called ''gunyahs'', hunted native animals such as kangaroos, fished in the Nepean River, and gathered local fruits and vegetables such as yams. They lived under an elaborate system of Law which had its origins in the [[Dreamtime]]. Most of the Mulgoa were killed by [[smallpox]] or ''galgala'' shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Early British explorers such as [[Watkin Tench]] described them as friendly, saying, \"they bade us adieu, in unabated friendship and good humour\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | title=The Dharug Story | author=Christopher Tobin | publisher=Mananura Aboriginal Centre | accessdate=18 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223218/http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe recorded history of Penrith began on 26 June 1789. Eighteen months after the landing of the [[First Fleet]], an exploring party led by [[Watkin Tench|Captain Watkin Tench]] set out to further discoveries made by Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] earlier in the month. In the daylight hours of 27 June, Tench and his party discovered the broad expanse of the [[Nepean River]]. Tench\u2019s party became the first Europeans to see the site of what is now the City of Penrith. Tench later wrote \u2018we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the  [[Thames]] at [[Putney]] and apparently of great depth\u2019. Phillip later named the river after [[Evan Nepean]], the under-secretary of state in the Home Office, who had been largely responsible for the organisation of the First Fleet. From this point, European settlement began in earnest, firstly on the Hawkesbury River, and later southward up the Nepean.\n\n===European settlement===\nGovernor [[Phillip Gidley King]] began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]]'s {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area. The first government building in the district was the military depot built (at the present Penrith police station) by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], in mid-1815 near the new Road ([[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]) on unassigned Crown land, set well back from the river. It represented the formalisation of law and order in the district. Its placement seems to have been a practical decision by Cox, placing it on flood-free Crown land on the new road to Parramatta, just east of Woodriff\u2019s Rodley Farm. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] paid Cox \u00a3200 for \u2018erecting a Depot for Provisions, Guard House, erecting necessary Enclosures for cattle and Garden Ground, Frame for a Well \u2026 on the new  near Emu Ford\u2019.  At this time, Emu Ford was one of the few locality names that would indicate the depot\u2019s position.\n\nIn 1816 Cox mentioned the lockup at \u2018Penryhn\u2019, among a list of expenses. There appears little doubt that he was referring to the depot that was later referred to as Penrith. The name for the new depot, Penrhyn, may have simply been misinterpreted by others.  Penrhyn was possibly named after the First Fleet ship that carried women convicts, the ''Lady Penrhyn''. There is no historical evidence to prove Macquarie's hand in naming the depot, especially considering he often endowed and recorded benefactors with that favour. Furthermore,  Macquarie would have ensured that a plan of the town would have been drawn up.  No documentary evidence has shed any light on Macquarie\u2019s  reasoning for the placement of this depot and its connection with his vision for a township at Castlereagh.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Penrith: The Makings of a City|last=Stacker|first=Lorraine|publisher=Halstead Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-920831-76-9|location=Penrith City Library|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that the origin of the name, Penrith is steeped in mystery. Penrith was possibly named after [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumbria by someone who knew the old town and who noted geographical similarities. By 1819, the name Penrith was in use with its first reference in the ''Sydney Gazette'' on 8 December 1821 appointing John Proctor as keeper of the new gaol and court house.\n\nThe lockup at Penrith placed government law and order in the centre of the Evan district. This group of buildings became the point of contact for local administration for anything ranging from issuing publican\u2019s licences, holding inquests and church services. Although a magistrate had been appointed to Castlereagh in 1811, the Penrith lockup increased in importance with its promotion to a court house in 1817. A bench of magistrates was appointed: [[Sir John Jamison]], the Reverend Henry Fulton, John McHenry and a military officer from the regiment stationed there. In 1814, [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]] constructed a [[Great Western Highway|road]] across the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] which passed through Woodriff's land at Penrith. Initial settlement in the area was unplanned but substantial enough for a courthouse to be established in 1817.<ref name=\"profile\">{{cite web|url=http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|title=Local suburb profile \u2013 Penrith|publisher=Penrith City Council|accessdate=18 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614014522/http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe post office was established in 1828, the Anglican church, St Stephens, was opened and consecrated 16 July 1839<ref name=\"NINETY YEARS OLD\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16549948 |title=Ninety Years Old |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 July 1929 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> followed by the Catholic Church, St Nicholas of Myra, in 1850.

In 1824, Sir John erected the colony's finest [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion, [[Regentville]] House, near Penrith, on a ridge overlooking the Nepean River. Sir John established an impressive agricultural estate at Regentville and became a Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. His grave can be seen in St Stephen's graveyard.

They lived in makeshift huts called ''gunyahs'', hunted native animals such as kangaroos, fished in the Nepean River, and gathered local fruits and vegetables such as yams. They lived under an elaborate system of Law which had its origins in the [[Dreamtime]]. Most of the Mulgoa were killed by [[smallpox]] or ''galgala'' shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Early British explorers such as [[Watkin Tench]] described them as friendly, saying, \"they bade us adieu, in unabated friendship and good humour\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | title=The Dharug Story | author=Christopher Tobin | publisher=Mananura Aboriginal Centre | accessdate=18 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223218/http://www.mananura.com/aboriginal-history-dharugtx.html | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe recorded history of Penrith began on 26 June 1789. Eighteen months after the landing of the [[First Fleet]], an exploring party led by [[Watkin Tench|Captain Watkin Tench]] set out to further discoveries made by Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] earlier in the month. In the daylight hours of 27 June, Tench and his party discovered the broad expanse of the [[Nepean River]]. Tench\u2019s party became the first Europeans to see the site of what is now the City of Penrith. Tench later wrote \u2018we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the  [[Thames]] at [[Putney]] and apparently of great depth\u2019. Phillip later named the river after [[Evan Nepean]], the under-secretary of state in the Home Office, who had been largely responsible for the organisation of the First Fleet. From this point, European settlement began in earnest, firstly on the Hawkesbury River, and later southward up the Nepean.\n\n===European settlement===\nGovernor [[Phillip Gidley King]] began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]]'s {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area. The first government building in the district was the military depot built (at the present Penrith police station) by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], in mid-1815 near the new Road ([[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]) on unassigned Crown land, set well back from the river. It represented the formalisation of law and order in the district. Its placement seems to have been a practical decision by Cox, placing it on flood-free Crown land on the new road to Parramatta, just east of Woodriff\u2019s Rodley Farm. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] paid Cox \u00a3200 for \u2018erecting a Depot for Provisions, Guard House, erecting necessary Enclosures for cattle and Garden Ground, Frame for a Well \u2026 on the new  near Emu Ford\u2019.  At this time, Emu Ford was one of the few locality names that would indicate the depot\u2019s position.\n\nIn 1816 Cox mentioned the lockup at \u2018Penryhn\u2019, among a list of expenses. There appears little doubt that he was referring to the depot that was later referred to as Penrith. The name for the new depot, Penrhyn, may have simply been misinterpreted by others.  Penrhyn was possibly named after the First Fleet ship that carried women convicts, the ''Lady Penrhyn''. There is no historical evidence to prove Macquarie's hand in naming the depot, especially considering he often endowed and recorded benefactors with that favour. Furthermore,  Macquarie would have ensured that a plan of the town would have been drawn up.  No documentary evidence has shed any light on Macquarie\u2019s  reasoning for the placement of this depot and its connection with his vision for a township at Castlereagh.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Penrith: The Makings of a City|last=Stacker|first=Lorraine|publisher=Halstead Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-920831-76-9|location=Penrith City Library|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that the origin of the name, Penrith is steeped in mystery. Penrith was possibly named after [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumbria by someone who knew the old town and who noted geographical similarities. By 1819, the name Penrith was in use with its first reference in the ''Sydney Gazette'' on 8 December 1821 appointing John Proctor as keeper of the new gaol and court house.\n\nThe lockup at Penrith placed government law and order in the centre of the Evan district. This group of buildings became the point of contact for local administration for anything ranging from issuing publican\u2019s licences, holding inquests and church services. Although a magistrate had been appointed to Castlereagh in 1811, the Penrith lockup increased in importance with its promotion to a court house in 1817. A bench of magistrates was appointed: [[Sir John Jamison]], the Reverend Henry Fulton, John McHenry and a military officer from the regiment stationed there. In 1814, [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]] constructed a [[Great Western Highway|road]] across the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] which passed through Woodriff's land at Penrith. Initial settlement in the area was unplanned but substantial enough for a courthouse to be established in 1817.<ref name=\"profile\">{{cite web|url=http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|title=Local suburb profile \u2013 Penrith|publisher=Penrith City Council|accessdate=18 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614014522/http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=436|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe post office was established in 1828, the Anglican church, St Stephens, was opened and consecrated 16 July 1839<ref name=\"NINETY YEARS OLD\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16549948 |title=Ninety Years Old |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 July 1929 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> followed by the Catholic Church, St Nicholas of Myra, in 1850.

In 1824, Sir John erected the colony's finest [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion, [[Regentville]] House, near Penrith, on a ridge overlooking the Nepean River. Sir John established an impressive agricultural estate at Regentville and became a Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. His grave can be seen in St Stephen's graveyard. Regentville House burned down in 1868 but most of its stonework was salvaged and used for building projects in and around Penrith.\n\nThe first bridge, financed by local business [[James Tobias Ryan|James Tobias (Toby) Ryan]]<ref name=\"Ryan ADB\">{{cite AuDB |id2=ryan-james-tobias-toby-4529 |title=Ryan, James Tobias (Toby) (1818\u20131899) |first=B G |last=Andrews |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> was opened over the Nepean in 1856 and was washed away the following year in a flood.
