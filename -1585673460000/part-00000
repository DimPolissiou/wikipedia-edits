Later that same year in August, the Minneapolis and Northwestern Railroad Company bought land for a railroad through the area (now the BNSF rail in downtown Albertville). After 30 years of contributions to the area, including Albert Zachman, who donated land for the current historic church by Central Park (also recognized as Lions Park) J.P. Eull and Theodore Aydt proposed a petition to incorporate the township as Saint Michael Station with a population of 190. The first election held, to construct a village hall, happened in 1903. It passed on a vote of 20-18 with a cost of $531.95 ($4,035.03 today). In the next few years, the town started to raise funds for a Catholic Church, completed in 1902, was named the Church of St. Albert, in honor of Albert Zachman's contributions to the town. In 1909, Father Duhr proposed to change the name to Albertville in 1909, again in honor of Albert Zachman. The town approved, but was not official until September 1919, making the name change official.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ci.albertville.mn.us/about-albertville/|title=About The City Of Albertville \u2013 City of Albertville MN|website=www.ci.albertville.mn.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|4.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>  Albertville is generally considered the halfway point between Minneapolis and Saint Cloud.\n\nThe city contains the Church of St Albert, constructed in 1902.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|Interstate 94]]/[[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US Highway 52]] serves as a main route in the city.

Later that same year in August, the Minneapolis and Northwestern Railroad Company bought land for a railroad through the area (now the BNSF rail in downtown Albertville). After 30 years of contributions to the area, including Albert Zachman, who donated land for the current historic church by Central Park (also recognized as Lions Park) J.P. Eull and Theodore Aydt proposed a petition to incorporate the township as Saint Michael Station with a population of 190. The first election held, to construct a village hall, happened in 1903. It passed on a vote of 20-18 with a cost of $531.95 ($4,035.03 today). In the next few years, the town started to raise funds for a Catholic Church, completed in 1902, was named the Church of St. Albert, in honor of Albert Zachman's contributions to the town. In 1909, Father Duhr proposed to change the name to Albertville in 1909, again in honor of Albert Zachman. The town approved, but was not official until September 1919, making the name change official.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ci.albertville.mn.us/about-albertville/|title=About The City Of Albertville \u2013 City of Albertville MN|website=www.ci.albertville.mn.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|4.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>  Albertville is generally considered the halfway point between Minneapolis and Saint Cloud.\n\nThe city contains the Church of St Albert, constructed in 1902.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|Interstate 94]]/[[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US Highway 52]] serves as a main route in the city.

The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]] was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], Brazil and the [[West Indies]] to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of [[Portuguese architecture]] can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island.

The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]]. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [[Ikoyi]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the [[Carter Bridge]], which starts from Iddo; the [[Eko Bridge]] (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the [[Third Mainland Bridge]], which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n=====Lagos Island=====\n\n{{Main|Lagos Island}}\n[[File:2010 Lagos Nigeria 5284107494.jpg|thumb|upright|Lagos Marina]]\nLagos Island contains a [[central business district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://limge.org/editorials.html|title=The lagos pressure group on the environment|publisher=Limge Online|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510195227/http://limge.org/editorials.html|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This district is characterized by high-rise buildings.

Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's [[Tinubu Square]] is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South [[protectorate]] to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n=====Ikoyi=====\n\n{{Main|Ikoyi}}\n[[Ikoyi]] is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a [[land fill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edo-nation.net/eko.htm |title=Journal of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers: ''An empirical study of the Lagos state rent edict of 1997'' |author=Oni, A.

Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a [[middle class]] neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [[upper middle class]] to the [[upper class]]. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n=====Victoria Island=====\n\n{{Main|Victoria Island (Nigeria)}}\n[[File:OandoHeadOffice.jpg|thumb|Oando Head Office in Victoria Island]]\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island.<ref name=\"Conference\" /> It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]].\n\nOne of the most important streets in Victoria Island Lagos is Saka Tinubu Street because it is where telecommunication business is done majorly, there is a plaza called GSM PLAZA where buying and selling of mobile phones and its accessories and other related businesses are carried out.\n\nIt was founded in 2001, a group of young men came together to form a small business outlets with each one having landline phone on the table and people made calls on pay as you use basis, but there was a new tune between 2002-2003 when gsm business commences in a bigger picture in Nigeria, today, it is a well known place.\n\n=====Iddo=====\n\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [[Iddo Island|Iddo]]. Iddo is also [[Lagos Terminus railway station|a railroad terminus]] and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |title=Giant Cities Of Tiny Islands |publisher= |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66gvsx099?url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Mainland====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Surulere]]. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include [[Surulere]], [[Apapa]], and [[Lagos Mainland]]. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Amuwo Odofin]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and [[Ikeja]] (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).\n\nMajor Areas on the mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n===Climate===\nLagos experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total {{convert|315.5|mm}}, while the driest month is January with precipitation total {{convert|13.2|mm}}.\n\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging {{cvt|28.3|-|32.9|C|F}}.

The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]]. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [[Ikoyi]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the [[Carter Bridge]], which starts from Iddo; the [[Eko Bridge]] (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the [[Third Mainland Bridge]], which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n=====Lagos Island=====\n\n{{Main|Lagos Island}}\n[[File:2010 Lagos Nigeria 5284107494.jpg|thumb|upright|Lagos Marina]]\nLagos Island contains a [[central business district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://limge.org/editorials.html|title=The lagos pressure group on the environment|publisher=Limge Online|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510195227/http://limge.org/editorials.html|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This district is characterized by high-rise buildings.

Originally a [[middle class]] neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [[upper middle class]] to the [[upper class]]. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n=====Victoria Island=====\n\n{{Main|Victoria Island (Nigeria)}}\n[[File:OandoHeadOffice.jpg|thumb|Oando Head Office in Victoria Island]]\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island.<ref name=\"Conference\" /> It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]].\n\nOne of the most important streets in Victoria Island Lagos is Saka Tinubu Street because it is where telecommunication business is done majorly, there is a plaza called GSM PLAZA where buying and selling of mobile phones and its accessories and other related businesses are carried out.\n\nIt was founded in 2001, a group of young men came together to form a small business outlets with each one having landline phone on the table and people made calls on pay as you use basis, but there was a new tune between 2002-2003 when gsm business commences in a bigger picture in Nigeria, today, it is a well known place.\n\n=====Iddo=====\n\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [[Iddo Island|Iddo]].

The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Surulere]]. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include [[Surulere]], [[Apapa]], and [[Lagos Mainland]]. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Amuwo Odofin]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and [[Ikeja]] (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).\n\nMajor Areas on the mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n===Climate===\nLagos experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season.

The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (most notably Lagos Island LGA, [[Lagos Mainland|Lagos Mainland LGA]] and [[Eti-Osa|Eti-Osa LGA]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Admin.

In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\n\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a [[megacity]] status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional {{convert|1,535.4|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}, comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining [[Ogun State]].

The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\n\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\n\nA second airport, [[Lekki-Epe International Airport]] is proposed.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main category|People from Lagos}}\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n*[[Israel Adesanya]], UFC Middle weight champion\n*[[Nelson Agholor]], Professional [[American football]] player, [[Super Bowl 52]] Champion with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 2018\n*[[Rilwan Akiolu]], Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos \n*[[Akinwunmi Ambode]], former Governor of Lagos state\n*[[Abike Dabiri]], Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\n*[[Agbani Darego]], Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\n*[[Buchi Emecheta]], novelist\n*[[Babatunde Fashola]], Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\n*[[Bode George]], Politician\n*[[Israel Idonije]], Professional [[American football]] player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\n*[[Hakeem Olajuwon]], professional basketball player\n*[[Yemi Osinbajo]], politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria \n*[[Babajide Sanwo-Olu]], Governor of Lagos State\n*[[Bola Tinubu]], Former Governor of Lagos State\n*[[Funsho Williams]], politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Africa#Nigeria|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Nigeria}}\n\nLagos is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref name=SC>{{cite web |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Lagos,%20Nigeria |publisher=SisterCities International |title=Lagos, Nigeria |location=Washington DC, USA |accessdate=2015-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171311/http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Lagos,%20Nigeria |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gary, Indiana]], United States, since 1991<ref name=SC/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/19703233/ |date=25 November 1991 |title=The Kokomo Tribune from Kokomo, Indiana \u00b7 Page 21 |journal=The Kokomo Tribune |location=Kokomo, Indiana |page=21 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-03-28 |via=Newspapers.com (Lindon, UT, USA)}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States, since 1974<ref name=SC/>\n*{{flagicon|ROM}} [[Bucharest]], Romania<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/cu-infratit-bucurestiult-1_50bdf86b7c42d5a663d0ec3e/index.html |title=Cu cine este \u00eenfr\u0103\u021bit Bucure\u0219tiul? |work=[[Adev\u0103rul]] |date=21 February 2011 |language=Romanian}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of largest cities]]\n*[[List of Governors of Lagos State]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Nigeria|Africa|Geography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n149. ^https://web.archive.org/web/20170623050548/http://www.faan.gov.ng/mmia/\n\n150. ^https://mypostalcode.com.ng/\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Alastair Leithead|Leithead, Alastair]] (August 2017).

[[Abdullah ibn Ziyad]], a sahabi of Muhammad, had a vision in his dream, in which the call for prayers was revealed to him by God. He later related this to his companions. Meanwhile, this news reached Muhammad, and confirmed it. Because of his stunning voice Muhammad chose a freed [[Habesha people|Habeshan]] slave by the name of [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] to make the call for prayers. Muhammad preferred the call better than the use of [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] (as used by the [[Christians]]) and [[shofar|horns]] (as by the [[Jews]]).<ref name=\"Sunan Abu Dawood\"/><ref name=\"Sunan al-Tirmidhi\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&pg=PA200 |accessdate= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 9789839154177|page=200|date=May 1994 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Adhan in Shalqar mosque.webm|thumb|265px|Sunni Adhan in [[:ru:\u041c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0443\u043b\u044b|Matey Qoqanuly mosque]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]] ''(Salat al-Jumu'ah)'', there is one adhan but some Sunni Muslims increase it to two adhans; the first is to call the people to the mosque, the second is said before the Imam begins the ''[[khutbah]]'' ([[sermon]]). Just before the prayers start, someone amongst the praying people recites the ''iqama'' as in all prayers. The basis for this is that at the time of the [[Caliph]] Uthman he ordered two adhans to be made, the first of which was to be made in the marketplace to inform the people that the Friday prayer was soon to begin, and the second adhan would be the regular one held in the mosque. Not all Sunnis prefer two adhans as the need for warning the people of the impending time for prayer is no longer essential now that the times for prayers are well known.\n\n===Shia view===\n[[Shia Islam|Shia]] sources state Muhammad, according to God's command, ordered the adhan as a means of calling Muslims to prayer. Shia Islam teaches that no one else contributed, or had any authority to contribute, towards the composition of the adhan.<ref name=\"Sunan Abu Dawood\" /><ref name=\"Sunan al-Tirmidhi\" /><ref name=\"Quran 1\"/>\n\nShia sources also narrate that [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] was, in fact, the first person to recite the Adhan publicly out loud in front of the Muslim congregation.\n\nThe fundamental phrase ''l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h'' is the foundation stone of Islam along with the belief in it. It declares that \"there is no god but the God\". This is the confession of ''[[Tawhid]]'' or the \"doctrine of Oneness [of God]\".\n\nThe phrase ''Mu\u1e25ammadun ras\u016blu -ll\u0101h'' fulfills the requirement that there should be someone to guide in the name of God, which states Muhammad is God's Messenger. This is the acceptance of prophethood or ''Nabuwat'' of Muhammad.\n[[File:Kalema at Bab al Nasr, Fatimid Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|photo of ''kalima'' at [[Bab al-Futuh|Bab al-Nasr]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo with phrase '''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h''' ]]\n[[File:Kalema-tut-shahadat.jpg|thumb|The [[qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|Mustansir]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of, in [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] of Cairo showing [[shahada|Kalimat ash-shah\u0101dah]] with the phrase ''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h'']]\nMuhammad declared [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] [[Succession to Muhammad|as his successor]], at [[Wadi Rabigh|Ghadir Khumm]], which was required for the continuation of his guidance. According to the [[hadith of the pond of Khumm]], Muhammad stated that \"Of whomsoever I am the [[mawla]], Ali is his mawla\". Hence, it is recommended to recite the phrase ''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012b -ll\u0101h'' means \"Ali is His (i.e. God's) Authority (''[[Wali]]'').\n\nIn one of the [[Qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] (1035\u20131094) of Fatemi era masjid of Qahira ([[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]) engraved his name and ''[[shahada|kalimat ash-shah\u0101dah]]'' as ''l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 -ll\u0101h, mu\u1e25ammadun ras\u016blu -ll\u0101h, \u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064c\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650}}).\n\nAdhan reminds Muslims of these three Islamic teaching ''Tawhid'', ''Nabuwat'' and ''[[Imamate]]'' before each prayer. These three emphasise devotion to God, Muhammad and [[Imam]], which are considered to be so linked together that they can not be viewed separately; one leads to other and finally to God.\n\nThe phrase is optional to some Shia as justified above.

[[Abdullah ibn Ziyad]], a sahabi of Muhammad, had a vision in his dream, in which the call for prayers was revealed to him by God. He later related this to his companions. Meanwhile, this news reached Muhammad, and confirmed it. Because of his stunning voice Muhammad chose a freed [[Habesha people|Habeshan]] slave by the name of [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] to make the call for prayers. Muhammad preferred the call better than the use of [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] (as used by the [[Christians]]) and [[shofar|horns]] (as by the [[Jews]]).<ref name=\"Sunan Abu Dawood\"/><ref name=\"Sunan al-Tirmidhi\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&pg=PA200 |accessdate= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 9789839154177|page=200|date=May 1994 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Adhan in Shalqar mosque.webm|thumb|265px|Sunni Adhan in [[:ru:\u041c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0443\u043b\u044b|Matey Qoqanuly mosque]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]] ''(Salat al-Jumu'ah)'', there is one adhan but some Sunni Muslims increase it to two adhans; the first is to call the people to the mosque, the second is said before the Imam begins the ''[[khutbah]]'' ([[sermon]]). Just before the prayers start, someone amongst the praying people recites the ''iqama'' as in all prayers. The basis for this is that at the time of the [[Caliph]] Uthman he ordered two adhans to be made, the first of which was to be made in the marketplace to inform the people that the Friday prayer was soon to begin, and the second adhan would be the regular one held in the mosque. Not all Sunnis prefer two adhans as the need for warning the people of the impending time for prayer is no longer essential now that the times for prayers are well known.\n\n===Shia view===\n[[Shia Islam|Shia]] sources state Muhammad, according to God's command, ordered the adhan as a means of calling Muslims to prayer. Shia Islam teaches that no one else contributed, or had any authority to contribute, towards the composition of the adhan.<ref name=\"Sunan Abu Dawood\" /><ref name=\"Sunan al-Tirmidhi\" /><ref name=\"Quran 1\"/>\n\nShia sources also narrate that [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] was, in fact, the first person to recite the Adhan publicly out loud in front of the Muslim congregation.\n\nThe fundamental phrase ''l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h'' is the foundation stone of Islam along with the belief in it. It declares that \"there is no god but the God\". This is the confession of ''[[Tawhid]]'' or the \"doctrine of Oneness [of God]\".\n\nThe phrase ''Mu\u1e25ammadun ras\u016blu -ll\u0101h'' fulfills the requirement that there should be someone to guide in the name of God, which states Muhammad is God's Messenger. This is the acceptance of prophethood or ''Nabuwat'' of Muhammad.\n[[File:Kalema at Bab al Nasr, Fatimid Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|photo of ''kalima'' at [[Bab al-Futuh|Bab al-Nasr]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo with phrase '''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h''' ]]\n[[File:Kalema-tut-shahadat.jpg|thumb|The [[qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|Mustansir]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of, in [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] of Cairo showing [[shahada|Kalimat ash-shah\u0101dah]] with the phrase ''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h'']]\nMuhammad declared [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] [[Succession to Muhammad|as his successor]], at [[Wadi Rabigh|Ghadir Khumm]], which was required for the continuation of his guidance. According to the [[hadith of the pond of Khumm]], Muhammad stated that \"Of whomsoever I am the [[mawla]], Ali is his mawla\". Hence, it is recommended to recite the phrase ''\u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012b -ll\u0101h'' means \"Ali is His (i.e. God's) Authority (''[[Wali]]'').\n\nIn one of the [[Qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] (1035\u20131094) of Fatemi era masjid of Qahira ([[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]) engraved his name and ''[[shahada|kalimat ash-shah\u0101dah]]'' as ''l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 -ll\u0101h, mu\u1e25ammadun ras\u016blu -ll\u0101h, \u02bfal\u012byun wal\u012byu -ll\u0101h'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064c\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650}}).\n\nAdhan reminds Muslims of these three Islamic teaching ''Tawhid'', ''Nabuwat'' and ''[[Imamate]]'' before each prayer. These three emphasise devotion to God, Muhammad and [[Imam]], which are considered to be so linked together that they can not be viewed separately; one leads to other and finally to God.\n\nThe phrase is optional to some Shia as justified above. They feel that Ali's ''Walayah'' (\"Divine Authority\") is self-evident, a testification and need not be declared.
