The first collection of the species was made on April 22, 2005, south of [[Padang Sidempuan]] in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[North Sumatra]].<ref name=jamban />\n\nThe formal description of ''N. jamban'' was published in 2006 in the botanical journal ''[[Blumea (journal)|Blumea]]''.{{Ref_label|A|note a|none}} The herbarium specimen ''Lee, Hernawati, Akhriadi NP 433'' was designated as the [[holotype]]. It is deposited at the [[Andalas University|Herbarium of Andalas University]] (ANDA).<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Description==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is a climbing plant. The stem, which is usually less than 5&nbsp;mm thick, grows to 4 m in length and is cylindrical-angular in cross section. [[plant stem|Internode]]s are up to 5&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\nLeaves are [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] and [[wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous]] in texture. The [[Leaf#Divisions of the lamina (blade)|lamina]] may be narrowly [[wikt:obovate|obovate]] to elliptic or slightly [[wikt:spathulate|spathulate]], and grows to 11&nbsp;cm in length and 3.3&nbsp;cm in width. One or two longitudinal veins are present on either side of the [[midrib]] together with numerous [[wikt:pinnate|pinnate]] veins. [[Tendril]]s are up to 24&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\n[[File:N. jamban17.jpg|thumb|left|A young plant with lower pitchers]]\n\nRosette and lower pitchers are cylindrical to narrowly [[wikt:infundibular|infundibular]] in the lower\nthird, becoming widely infundibular above. They are relatively small, rarely exceeding 5.8&nbsp;cm in height and 4.4&nbsp;cm in width. Fringed wings (\u22642&nbsp;mm wide) are usually present in terrestrial pitchers. The pitcher mouth is almost horizontal. The inner surface of the pitchers is [[gland]]ular throughout. The flattened [[peristome]] may be up to 8&nbsp;mm wide and is lined with a series of teeth (\u22640.5&nbsp;mm long) on its inner margin. The lid or [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] is narrowly [[wikt:obovate|obovate]], and up to 3.8&nbsp;cm long and 1.3&nbsp;cm wide. The undersurface of the lid bears scattered small red glands that are concentrated around the [[midrib]]. Around 20 to 30 very large crater-like glands (\u22640.5&nbsp;mm wide) are present in the [[wikt:apical|apical]] quarter. These glands are so large that they are visible as swellings on the upper surface of the lid. The [[Spur (biology)|spur]] (\u22644&nbsp;mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. It is generally unbranched but may be forked.<ref name=jamban />\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Nepenthesjamban3.jpg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = N. jamban1.jpg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = An intermediate pitcher (left) and an upper pitcher (right)\n}}\n\nUpper pitchers are circular in cross section and widely infundibular in their upper half. They are much larger than lower pitchers, reaching 12&nbsp;cm in height and 5.2&nbsp;cm in width. The pitcher mouth is horizontal and [[wikt:orbicular|orbicular]]. As in lower pitchers, the inner surface of the pitchers is wholly glandular. Wings are reduced to ribs that run down the front of the pitcher. In aerial pitchers, the flattened peristome is up 6&nbsp;mm wide and bears more prominent teeth (\u22641&nbsp;mm long). The spur is usually simple and grows to 3.5&nbsp;mm in length. Compared to lower pitchers, the lid in upper pitchers is similar in shape but longer, reaching 4.8&nbsp;cm in length and 0.9&nbsp;cm in width. It is held over the pitcher mouth at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' has a [[raceme|racemose]] [[inflorescence]]. In male plants, the inflorescence may be up to 18&nbsp;cm long. The female inflorescence has not been described. The [[rachis]] is up to 11.5&nbsp;cm long, while the [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] is up to 6.5&nbsp;cm long. [[Pedicel (botany)|Pedicels]] are up to 1.4&nbsp;cm long and bear a single flower. [[Sepal]]s are elliptical and around 3.5&nbsp;mm long. Mature fruits are up to 3&nbsp;cm long and 6&nbsp;mm wide. [[Seed]]s are [[wikt:filiform|filiform]] and around 2&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\nMost parts of the plant are [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]]. Developing pitchers, tendrils, and inflorescences are densely covered with short brownish-grey hairs.<ref name=jamban />\n\nThe stem is characteristically purplish red. The leaves and inflorescence are light green to pale green. Lower pitchers range in colour from yellowish orange to bright red throughout. Upper pitchers are generally bright yellow with a yellow to orange peristome, and may be occasionally speckled on their inner surfaces.<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Ecology==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Barisan Mountains]] that line the western side of [[Sumatra]]. It is known only from the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]], south of [[Padang Sidempuan]] in [[North Sumatra]].<ref name=jamban /> The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1800\u20132100&nbsp;m [[above sea level]].<ref name=McPherson>McPherson, S.R. 2009.

''[[Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java]]''. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.</ref>\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' grows in upper montane [[mossy forest]] amongst summit [[Scrubland|scrub vegetation]]. Unlike the closely related ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]'', it only occurs terrestrially.<ref name=jamban />\n\nIn the wild, ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' occurs sympatrically with ''[[Nepenthes bongso|N.&nbsp;bongso]]'', ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N.&nbsp;dubia]]'', ''[[Nepenthes gymnamphora|N.&nbsp;gymnamphora]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]''.<ref name=jamban /> A [[natural hybrid]] with ''N.&nbsp;lingulata'' has been recorded.<ref name=JavaSumatra />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | footer    = ''Nepenthes jamban'' growing among ridgetop vegetation (left and left middle) and sympatric lower pitchers (right middle) and upper pitchers (right) of ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]'' in upper [[montane forest]]\n | image1    = N. jamban7.jpg\n | width1    = 180 \n | image2    = N. jamban15.jpg\n | width2    = 180 \n | image3    = N. jamban and N. lingulata2.jpg\n | width3    = 180 \n | image4    = N. jamban and N. lingulata.jpg\n | width4    = 180 \n}}\n\n==Carnivory==\nThe upper pitchers of ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' have been noted for trapping many large prey items, such as [[wasp]]s and [[crickets]], and relatively few small animals. The traps of this species also support large populations of [[Nepenthes infauna|pitcher infauna]], particularly [[mosquito]] [[larva]]e.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' produces thick, [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] pitcher liquid similar to that found in related species such as ''[[Nepenthes inermis|N.&nbsp;inermis]]''. The pitchers of ''N.&nbsp;inermis'' function not only as [[Carnivorous plant#Pitfall traps|pitfall traps]] but also as [[Carnivorous plant#Flypaper traps|flypaper traps]], with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.<ref name=Clarke>Clarke, C.M. 2001. ''[[Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia]]''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref> A similar trapping method may be employed by ''N.&nbsp;jamban''.\n\n[[File:N. jamban8.jpg|thumb|left|Unlike ''N. jacquelineae'', ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' has only one-flowered pedicels]] Nepenthes like ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N.&nbsp;dubia]]'' also use this method with [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] pitcher fluid. Most Sumatran nepenthes just like N. jamban have very viscous pitcher fluid,just like [[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]] do. It is so viscous  that if the pitcher is held upside-down, the fluid will pour out, forming an unbroken stream several metres in length.\n\n==Related species==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' belongs to a group of related Sumatran species that includes ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N. dubia]]'', ''[[Nepenthes inermis|N. inermis]]'', ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes tenuis|N. tenuis]]''. It shares with these species features such as [[wikt:infundibulate|infundibulate]] pitchers which are wholly glandular on their inner surfaces, [[bract]]eate inflorescences, and [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] leaves. All of these ''Nepenthes'' produce very viscous pitcher fluid.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is thought to be most closely related to ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]''. Both [[taxon|taxa]] have a narrow lid and massive nectar glands, a trait unique to these two species. However, the glands of ''N. jacquelineae'' may be even larger (\u22641.5&nbsp;mm wide).<ref name=Clarke /> In addition, the two species can be easily distinguished on the basis of [[peristome]] morphology and floral characteristics. ''N. jamban'' is not as robust as ''N. jacquelineae'' and lacks the greatly expanded peristome that is so characteristic of that species. Furthermore, ''N. jamban'' differs in having longer and one-flowered partial peduncles, and a narrower lid.<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Natural hybrids==\n[[File:Nepenthes jamban \u00d7 Nepenthes lingulata.jpg|thumb|A lower pitcher of ''N. jamban'' \u00d7 ''N. lingulata'']]\nA [[natural hybrid]] involving ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]'' has been recorded.<ref name=JavaSumatra /> In 2009, Adrian Y.

The first collection of the species was made on April 22, 2005, south of [[Padang Sidempuan]] in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[North Sumatra]].<ref name=jamban />\n\nThe formal description of ''N. jamban'' was published in 2006 in the botanical journal ''[[Blumea (journal)|Blumea]]''.{{Ref_label|A|note a|none}} The herbarium specimen ''Lee, Hernawati, Akhriadi NP 433'' was designated as the [[holotype]]. It is deposited at the [[Andalas University|Herbarium of Andalas University]] (ANDA).<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Description==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is a climbing plant. The stem, which is usually less than 5&nbsp;mm thick, grows to 4 m in length and is cylindrical-angular in cross section. [[plant stem|Internode]]s are up to 5&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\nLeaves are [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] and [[wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous]] in texture. The [[Leaf#Divisions of the lamina (blade)|lamina]] may be narrowly [[wikt:obovate|obovate]] to elliptic or slightly [[wikt:spathulate|spathulate]], and grows to 11&nbsp;cm in length and 3.3&nbsp;cm in width. One or two longitudinal veins are present on either side of the [[midrib]] together with numerous [[wikt:pinnate|pinnate]] veins. [[Tendril]]s are up to 24&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\n[[File:N. jamban17.jpg|thumb|left|A young plant with lower pitchers]]\n\nRosette and lower pitchers are cylindrical to narrowly [[wikt:infundibular|infundibular]] in the lower\nthird, becoming widely infundibular above. They are relatively small, rarely exceeding 5.8&nbsp;cm in height and 4.4&nbsp;cm in width. Fringed wings (\u22642&nbsp;mm wide) are usually present in terrestrial pitchers. The pitcher mouth is almost horizontal. The inner surface of the pitchers is [[gland]]ular throughout. The flattened [[peristome]] may be up to 8&nbsp;mm wide and is lined with a series of teeth (\u22640.5&nbsp;mm long) on its inner margin. The lid or [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] is narrowly [[wikt:obovate|obovate]], and up to 3.8&nbsp;cm long and 1.3&nbsp;cm wide. The undersurface of the lid bears scattered small red glands that are concentrated around the [[midrib]]. Around 20 to 30 very large crater-like glands (\u22640.5&nbsp;mm wide) are present in the [[wikt:apical|apical]] quarter. These glands are so large that they are visible as swellings on the upper surface of the lid. The [[Spur (biology)|spur]] (\u22644&nbsp;mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. It is generally unbranched but may be forked.<ref name=jamban />\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Nepenthesjamban3.jpg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = N. jamban1.jpg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = An intermediate pitcher (left) and an upper pitcher (right)\n}}\n\nUpper pitchers are circular in cross section and widely infundibular in their upper half. They are much larger than lower pitchers, reaching 12&nbsp;cm in height and 5.2&nbsp;cm in width. The pitcher mouth is horizontal and [[wikt:orbicular|orbicular]]. As in lower pitchers, the inner surface of the pitchers is wholly glandular. Wings are reduced to ribs that run down the front of the pitcher. In aerial pitchers, the flattened peristome is up 6&nbsp;mm wide and bears more prominent teeth (\u22641&nbsp;mm long). The spur is usually simple and grows to 3.5&nbsp;mm in length. Compared to lower pitchers, the lid in upper pitchers is similar in shape but longer, reaching 4.8&nbsp;cm in length and 0.9&nbsp;cm in width. It is held over the pitcher mouth at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' has a [[raceme|racemose]] [[inflorescence]]. In male plants, the inflorescence may be up to 18&nbsp;cm long. The female inflorescence has not been described. The [[rachis]] is up to 11.5&nbsp;cm long, while the [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] is up to 6.5&nbsp;cm long. [[Pedicel (botany)|Pedicels]] are up to 1.4&nbsp;cm long and bear a single flower. [[Sepal]]s are elliptical and around 3.5&nbsp;mm long. Mature fruits are up to 3&nbsp;cm long and 6&nbsp;mm wide. [[Seed]]s are [[wikt:filiform|filiform]] and around 2&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=jamban />\n\nMost parts of the plant are [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]]. Developing pitchers, tendrils, and inflorescences are densely covered with short brownish-grey hairs.<ref name=jamban />\n\nThe stem is characteristically purplish red. The leaves and inflorescence are light green to pale green. Lower pitchers range in colour from yellowish orange to bright red throughout. Upper pitchers are generally bright yellow with a yellow to orange peristome, and may be occasionally speckled on their inner surfaces.<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Ecology==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Barisan Mountains]] that line the western side of [[Sumatra]]. It is known only from the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]], south of [[Padang Sidempuan]] in [[North Sumatra]].<ref name=jamban /> The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1800\u20132100&nbsp;m [[above sea level]].<ref name=McPherson>McPherson, S.R. 2009.

Unlike the closely related ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]'', it only occurs terrestrially.<ref name=jamban />\n\nIn the wild, ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' occurs sympatrically with ''[[Nepenthes bongso|N.&nbsp;bongso]]'', ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N.&nbsp;dubia]]'', ''[[Nepenthes gymnamphora|N.&nbsp;gymnamphora]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]''.<ref name=jamban /> A [[natural hybrid]] with ''N.&nbsp;lingulata'' has been recorded.<ref name=JavaSumatra />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | footer    = ''Nepenthes jamban'' growing among ridgetop vegetation (left and left middle) and sympatric lower pitchers (right middle) and upper pitchers (right) of ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]'' in upper [[montane forest]]\n | image1    = N. jamban7.jpg\n | width1    = 180 \n | image2    = N. jamban15.jpg\n | width2    = 180 \n | image3    = N. jamban and N. lingulata2.jpg\n | width3    = 180 \n | image4    = N. jamban and N. lingulata.jpg\n | width4    = 180 \n}}\n\n==Carnivory==\nThe upper pitchers of ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' have been noted for trapping many large prey items, such as [[wasp]]s and [[crickets]], and relatively few small animals. The traps of this species also support large populations of [[Nepenthes infauna|pitcher infauna]], particularly [[mosquito]] [[larva]]e.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' produces thick, [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] pitcher liquid similar to that found in related species such as ''[[Nepenthes inermis|N.&nbsp;inermis]]''. The pitchers of ''N.&nbsp;inermis'' function not only as [[Carnivorous plant#Pitfall traps|pitfall traps]] but also as [[Carnivorous plant#Flypaper traps|flypaper traps]], with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.<ref name=Clarke>Clarke, C.M. 2001. ''[[Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia]]''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref> A similar trapping method may be employed by ''N.&nbsp;jamban''.\n\n[[File:N. jamban8.jpg|thumb|left|Unlike ''N. jacquelineae'', ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' has only one-flowered pedicels]] Nepenthes like ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N.&nbsp;dubia]]'' also use this method with [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] pitcher fluid.\n\n==Related species==\n''Nepenthes jamban'' belongs to a group of related Sumatran species that includes ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N. dubia]]'', ''[[Nepenthes inermis|N. inermis]]'', ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes tenuis|N. tenuis]]''. It shares with these species features such as [[wikt:infundibulate|infundibulate]] pitchers which are wholly glandular on their inner surfaces, [[bract]]eate inflorescences, and [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] leaves. All of these ''Nepenthes'' produce very viscous pitcher fluid.<ref name=jamban />\n\n''Nepenthes jamban'' is thought to be most closely related to ''[[Nepenthes jacquelineae|N. jacquelineae]]''. Both [[taxon|taxa]] have a narrow lid and massive nectar glands, a trait unique to these two species. However, the glands of ''N. jacquelineae'' may be even larger (\u22641.5&nbsp;mm wide).<ref name=Clarke /> In addition, the two species can be easily distinguished on the basis of [[peristome]] morphology and floral characteristics. ''N. jamban'' is not as robust as ''N. jacquelineae'' and lacks the greatly expanded peristome that is so characteristic of that species. Furthermore, ''N. jamban'' differs in having longer and one-flowered partial peduncles, and a narrower lid.<ref name=jamban />\n\n==Natural hybrids==\n[[File:Nepenthes jamban \u00d7 Nepenthes lingulata.jpg|thumb|A lower pitcher of ''N. jamban'' \u00d7 ''N. lingulata'']]\nA [[natural hybrid]] involving ''N.&nbsp;jamban'' and ''[[Nepenthes lingulata|N.&nbsp;lingulata]]'' has been recorded.<ref name=JavaSumatra /> In 2009, Adrian Y.
