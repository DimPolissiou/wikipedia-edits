The second self-released album was titled ''[[Experiments In Alchemy]]'' and released in 1998. ''Experiments'' saw more heavy metal numbers, as opposed to the more ballady feel on many of ''Massage's'' songs. That same year, ''DFD'' signed with Outerloop Records and released ''[[The Embryo's in Bloom]]''. The studio quality of the album is noticeably better than its predecessors, and the band was very pleased with the resulted sound.<ref>{{cite web|author=R.

Ensminger and Combs were credited as performing on the album, though not as band members. The spot of lead guitar was temporarily filled by Jason Stevens for the ''Committed'' tour, during which bassist and original member Stephen Mears left the band to join the Navy. Mears was replaced by Brian White, and after the tour, Stevens was replaced by [[Margret Heater]] member Jasan Stepp as lead guitarist.

Their sound has often been compared to the [[Northern California]] genre-defying act, [[Mr. Bungle]]. The band members themselves have cited their collective influences as being [[Mike Patton]] (Mr. Bungle, [[Faith No More]]), [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]] and [[Frank Zappa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/community/chat/2001-04-25-dogfashiondisco.htm|title=USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}</ref>\n\n===Early Years (1995\u20132000)===\nDog Fashion Disco, or ''DFD'' as many fans refer to them as, was formed in 1995 by Todd Smith, Greg Combs, and John Ensminger, who all went to high school together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/thevault/interviews/dogfashiondisco.shtml |title=Dog Fashion Disco |publisher=Theprp.com |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> Originally their name was ''Hug The Retard'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beowolfproductions.com/DogFashionDiscoInterview.html |title=DOG FASHION DISCO Interview |publisher=Beowolfproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> but this was changed name to Dog Fashion Disco before releasing any material, as they felt the name Hug The Retard was too offensive and might cost them fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juggle.com/dog-fashion-disco|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20130126234530/http://www.juggle.com/dog-fashion-disco|url-status=dead|title=Dog Fashion Disco Background, Music Facts, and Group Influences \u2013 Juggle.com}}</ref> Their first two releases were self-released and low budget products. The first \u2013 ''[[Erotic Massage (album)|Erotic Massage]]'' \u2013 was funded by a loan taken out by drummer John Ensminger, which his father had to co-sign on and \"took nearly a year of local shows to pay off the part of the loan that was used for studio time, printing and pressing\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.razortowrist.com/forum/index.php?topic=60.new#new |title=Dad Hearts You |publisher=Razortowrist.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and was released independently by the band in 1997. The second self-released album was titled ''[[Experiments In Alchemy]]'' and released in 1998. ''Experiments'' saw more heavy metal numbers, as opposed to the more ballady feel on many of ''Massage's'' songs. That same year, ''DFD'' signed with Outerloop Records and released ''[[The Embryo's in Bloom]]''. The studio quality of the album is noticeably better than its predecessors, and the band was very pleased with the resulted sound.<ref>{{cite web|author=R.

Ensminger and Combs were credited as performing on the album, though not as band members. The spot of lead guitar was temporarily filled by Jason Stevens for the ''Committed'' tour, during which bassist and original member Stephen Mears left the band to join the Navy. Mears was replaced by Brian White, and after the tour, Stevens was replaced by [[Margret Heater]] member Jasan Stepp as lead guitarist. This lineup recorded the ''Day of the Dead EP'' and the live album ''The City Is Alive Tonight'', released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, and is the band lineup in ''DFDVD''.\n\n===Rotten Records, Adultery and Hiatus (2005\u20132007)===\n[[Image:Jasandfd fletchers.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist Jasan Stepp performing with DFD at Fletchers Bar in Baltimore, Maryland.]][[Image:Dfdfarewell.JPG|thumb|right|The members of Dog Fashion Disco hugging after performing their final song.]]\nAfter a short period of off-time in the first half of 2005 (in which [[The Alter Boys]] sole album was made and released), Oliver quit the band. Shortly after, ''DFD's'' contract with Artemis was ended, and ''DFD'' were signed to Rotten Records. On April 4, 2006, they released their sixth studio album, ''[[Adultery (Dog Fashion Disco album)|Adultery]]'', which featured the return of original drummer John Ensminger.

Many of the shows took place in smaller venues (with subsequently smaller audiences) than their tours while signed to Spitfire and Artemis, and, according to Jasan Stepp, resulted in low morale among the band.\n\nOn December 5, 2006, Todd Smith Dog posted a blog entry on Dog Fashion Disco's official [[MySpace]] stating that the band had decided to call it quits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=390698&blogId=201693050 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711070122/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=390698&blogId=201693050 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |accessdate=2015-09-07 }}</ref> They performed their farewell show at the Sonar Lounge in Baltimore, Maryland on January 13, 2007 to a capacity crowd, with fans coming from as far away as the [[United Kingdom]]. The band played a marathon 25+ song set, ending with the crowd-favorite \"Albino Rhino\" from the 1998 ''Experiments in Alchemy'' album (this was a common concert-closer), and played the song \"Sweet Insanity\" from their newest album, ''Adultery'', for an encore song. Other past band members including Sennan Quigley and Mike \"Ollie\" Oliver attended to show support for their former musical family.  The show was opened by the band [[Oddzar]]. The event was recorded and then released on the DVD ''[[DFDVD II]]'' by Rotten Records on October 28, 2008.\n\n==Post\u2013disbandment bands==\n\n===Polkadot Cadaver===\n{{Main|Polkadot Cadaver}}\nOn April 17, 2007, a bulletin was posted on the Dog Fashion Disco MySpace page, announcing a new project, [[Polkadot Cadaver]], which is stylistically similar to Dog Fashion Disco.

It was formed during [[World War II]] by [[Charles Henderson (character)|Charles Henderson]]; a British spy who had used children during an operation in France. It is populated by around 350 adolescents and children, who live on the campus when not on a mission to help the police. No-one in the world knows where CHERUB campus is situated except its employees, members and certain police and high level members of the British government.\n\nCHERUB began with a small number of boys which swelled in size as the government realised its worth. After several years of operation it took in a trial group of girls, which proved successful. Since then CHERUB campus has grown a significant amount, improving many of its facilities. The dojo was built on behalf of a successful operation that took place in Japan and the new mission preparation building was built by the chairman of the first 6 novels, Dr. McAfferty, better known as Mac. After retiring at the end of ''Man Vs Beast'', he is replaced by Zara Asker, who holds the role for ten years until stepping down to be replace by husband Ewart Asker shortly before ''New Guard''.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\nAfter years of speculation, Muchamore said in the [[Henderson's Boys]] novel ''Eagle Day'' that CHERUB stood for Charles Henderson Espionage Research Unit B; this was later confirmed in ''Secret Army'' by Eileen McAfferty in a telegram.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of CHERUB characters}}\n*[[James Adams (character)|James Adams]] is the main protagonist of the series. He is a strong, stocky boy ranging from just under twelve to eighteen years old through the course of the series. Although usually friendly, he does occasionally have anger management issues. During the series he has had two on-campus girlfriends, [[Kerry Chang]] and [[Dana Smith (character)|Dana Smith]], as well as various girlfriends on missions. He gets on well with his half-sister [[Lauren Adams]].\n*[[Lauren Adams]] is James' sister. She is headstrong and does well in missions, however she does create various schemes to pay people back for actions, which result in her receiving punishments. She has a boyfriend called [[Greg Rathbone|Rat]].\n*[[Kyle Blueman]] is another CHERUB agent who is friends with James. He was recruited when he was eight years old. He is homosexual, something that James has trouble coming to terms with. He is kind, but will also conduct revenge schemes, including one in which he exposes politician Tan Abdullah as conducting illegal activities in [[Shadow Wave]], the twelfth book of the series.\n*[[Kerry Chang]] is a James' main love interest throughout the series. She befriends James in the first novel and helps him get through basic training. She is also a Hong-Kong born karate champion\n*[[Bruce Norris (character)|Bruce Norris]] is a CHERUB agent who is friends with James. Bruce is a small but very strong kid; he is a campus karate champion.\n*[[Greg \"Rat\" Rathbone]] is about a year younger than James. He is Lauren Adams boyfriend.

It was formed during [[World War II]] by [[Charles Henderson (character)|Charles Henderson]]; a British spy who had used children during an operation in France. It is populated by around 350 adolescents and children, who live on the campus when not on a mission to help the police. No-one in the world knows where CHERUB campus is situated except its employees, members and certain police and high level members of the British government.\n\nCHERUB began with a small number of boys which swelled in size as the government realised its worth. After several years of operation it took in a trial group of girls, which proved successful. Since then CHERUB campus has grown a significant amount, improving many of its facilities. The dojo was built on behalf of a successful operation that took place in Japan and the new mission preparation building was built by the chairman of the first 6 novels, Dr. McAfferty, better known as Mac. After retiring at the end of ''Man Vs Beast'', he is replaced by Zara Asker, who holds the role for ten years until stepping down to be replace by husband Ewart Asker shortly before ''New Guard''.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\nAfter years of speculation, Muchamore said in the [[Henderson's Boys]] novel ''Eagle Day'' that CHERUB stood for Charles Henderson Espionage Research Unit B; this was later confirmed in ''Secret Army'' by Eileen McAfferty in a telegram.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of CHERUB characters}}\n*[[James Adams (character)|James Adams]] is the main protagonist of the series.

Other [[multi-frequency]] systems are used for internal signaling within the telephone network.\n\n==Multifrequency signaling==\nPrior to the development of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as [[pulse dialing]] (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the [[local loop]] between the telephone exchange and the [[calling party]]'s telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the [[rotary dial]] as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was possible only on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special [[subscriber trunk dialing]] equipment. Operators used an earlier type of [[multi-frequency]] signaling.\n\n'''Multi-frequency signaling''' ('''MF''') is a group of signaling methods that use a mixture of two [[pure tone]] (pure [[sine wave]]) sounds. Various MF signaling [[Communications protocol|protocols]] were devised by the [[Bell System]] and [[CCITT]]. The earliest of these were for [[in-band]] signaling between switching centers, where [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]] used a 16-[[Numerical digit|digit]] [[keypad]] to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance [[telephone call]]s, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.\n\nThe DTMF system uses a set of eight audio frequencies transmitted in pairs to represent 16 signals, represented by the ten digits, the letters A to D, and the symbols ''#'' and ''*''. As the signals are audible tones in the voice frequency range, they can be transmitted through electrical repeaters and amplifiers, and over radio and microwave links, thus eliminating the need for intermediate operators on long-distance circuits.\n\nAT&T described the product as \"a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path.\"<ref>AT&T, ''Compatibility Bulletin No. 105''</ref> In order to prevent consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ from all of the pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, [[R2 signalling|R2]], CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by [[Signalling System No 7|SS7]] digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark ''Touch-Tone''. The term was first used by AT&T in commerce on July 5, 1960, and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first [[push-button telephone]] was made available to the public.

In the end, the lettered keys were dropped from most phones, and it was many years before the two symbol keys became widely used for [[vertical service code]]s such as *67 in the United States of America and Canada to suppress [[caller ID]].\n\nPublic [[payphone]]s that accept credit cards use these additional codes to send the information from the [[magnetic strip]].\n\nThe [[Autovon|AUTOVON]] telephone system of the [[United States Armed Forces]] used these signals to assert certain privilege and priority levels when placing telephone calls.<ref>[http://www.tech-faq.com/abcd.shtml \"What are the ABCD tones?\" \u2014 Tech FAQ]</ref>  Precedence is still a feature of military telephone networks, but using number combinations.

For example, key ''A'' is used in some networks for cycling through a list of carriers.

The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.\n\nDTMF tones are used in some [[caller ID]] systems to transfer the caller ID information, but in the United States the [[Bell 202 modem|Bell 202]] modulated [[frequency-shift keying]] (FSK) signaling is used to transfer the data.\n\n==Keypad==\n[[File:MultiTone1.png|thumb|right|Combination of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz sine waves, representing DTMF \"1\"]]\nThe DTMF [[telephone keypad]] is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low  frequency component and each column represents the high frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the ''1'' key produces a superimposition of a 697 [[hertz|Hz]] low tone and a 1209 Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact. The tones are decoded by the switching center to determine the keys pressed by the user.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ DTMF keypad frequencies (with sound clips)\n|-\n!align=center|\n!align=center| 1209&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1336&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1477&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1633&nbsp;Hz\n|-\n!align=center| 697&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf1.ogg|1]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf2.ogg|2]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf3.ogg|3]]\n|align=center| [[Media:DtmfA.ogg|A]]\n|-\n!align=center| 770&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf4.ogg|4]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf5.ogg|5]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf6.ogg|6]]\n|align=center| [[Media:DtmfB.ogg|B]]\n|-\n!align=center| 852&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf7.ogg|7]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf8.ogg|8]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf9.ogg|9]]\n|align=center| [[Media:DtmfC.ogg|C]]\n|-\n!align=center| 941&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[Media:DtmfStar.ogg|*]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf0.ogg|0]]\n|align=center| [[Media:Dtmf-.ogg|#]]\n|align=center| [[Media:DtmfD.ogg|D]]\n|}\n\n==Decoding==\n[[File:1&1 NetXXL powered by FRITZ! - CMD CM8870CSI on mainboard-1833.jpg|thumb|Two CMD CM8870CSI DTMF Receivers]]\nDTMF was originally decoded by tuned [[Filter_bank|filter banks]]. By the end of the 20th century, [[digital signal processing]] became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the [[Goertzel algorithm]]. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (''twist'').<ref>W.

The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.\n\nDTMF tones are used in some [[caller ID]] systems to transfer the caller ID information, but in the United States the [[Bell 202 modem|Bell 202]] modulated [[frequency-shift keying]] (FSK) signaling is used to transfer the data.\n\n==Keypad==\n[[File:MultiTone1.png|thumb|right|Combination of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz sine waves, representing DTMF \"1\"]]\nThe DTMF [[telephone keypad]] is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low  frequency component and each column represents the high frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the ''1'' key produces a superimposition of a 697 [[hertz|Hz]] low tone and a 1209 Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact.

By the end of the 20th century, [[digital signal processing]] became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the [[Goertzel algorithm]]. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (''twist'').<ref>W. D. Reeves, ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook\u2014Analog'', IEEE (1992), p.27</ref>\n\n==Other multiple frequency signals==\nNational telephone systems define other tones, outside the DTMF specification, that indicate the status of lines, equipment, or the result of calls, and for control of equipment for troubleshooting or service purposes. Such [[call-progress tone]]s are often also composed of multiple frequencies and are standardized in each country. The Bell System defined them in the [[Precise Tone Plan]].<ref>AT&T, ''Notes on Distance Dialing'', 1968</ref> Bell's [[Multi-frequency signaling]] and AT&T's [[2600 hertz]] were exploited by [[blue box]] devices.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Selective calling]]\n* [[Special information tone]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-F.902/en ITU's recommendations for implementing DTMF services]\n* {{Citation\n | last=Schenker\n | first=L\n | title=Pushbutton Calling with a Two-Group Voice-Frequency Code\n | journal=The Bell System Technical Journal\n | volume=39\n | issue=1\n | year=1960\n | pages=235\u2013255\n | issn=0005-8580\n | url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol39-1960/articles/bstj39-1-235.pdf |ref=none\n | doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb03929.x\n }}.\n* {{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/bstj39-4-995|last1=Deininger|first1=R.L.|title=Human Factors Engineering Studies of the Design and Use of Pushbutton Telephone Sets|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=July 4, 1960|volume=39|issue=4|pages=995\u20131012|doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb04447.x}}\n* Frank Durda, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110925184759/http://nemesis.lonestar.org/reference/telecom/signaling/dtmf.html Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (Touch-Tone\u00ae) Reference], 2006.\n* [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.24/en ITU-T Recommendation Q.24 - Multifrequency push-button signal reception]\n\n{{Telsigs}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Western Electric}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency Signaling}}\n[[Category:Telephony signals]]\n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n", "name_user": "Artoria2e5", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther multiple frequency signals", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling"}

On June 3, 1971, it moved to the basement of the [[Iglesia Ni Cristo Central Office]] in Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. Shortly afterwards, it acquired a new frequency, 1460 kHz. On May 10, 1975, DZEM once again moved at the third floor of the Iglesia ni Cristo Development Center Building at [[Carlos Palanca]] St., [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]]. After a month, it also altered its frequency to 1360&nbsp;kHz. Then on November 1978, as a result of band adjustments, DZEM had again changed its frequency to 1422&nbsp;kHz due to the switch of the Philippine AM dial from the NARBA-mandated 10&nbsp;kHz spacing to the 9&nbsp;kHz rule implemented by the [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975]]. On May 9, 1985, the station found a new home \u2013 the third floor of Maligaya Building 2 at 887 [[Epifanio delos Santos Avenue|EDSA]], Quezon City. It acquired the frequency of 954&nbsp;kHz on April 27, 1987, which it still uses today.

The station's [[studio]] is located at Barn Studio Building, [[New Era University]] Campus, #9 Central Avenue, [[Quezon City]], and its [[transmitter]] is located at Barangay Paliwas, [[Obando, Bulacan]]. DZEM operates 20 hours daily from 4:00 AM to 12:00 MN. on 954&nbsp;kHz AM Band, while it operates 24 hours daily via internet streaming (except during an International Evangelical Mission On-air and Online, where it broadcasts 24 hours on all platforms).\n\n==History==\nDZEM began its broadcast in February 10, 1969, and continues its 24/7 broadcasts of religious and secular programs all week long, from Mondays to Sundays.\n\nDZEM is also known as the most widely traveled radio station in [[Metro Manila]] as it began broadcasting in Barrio Ugong del Monte, Quezon City on 1520&nbsp;kHz with a power of 10,000 watts. On June 3, 1971, it moved to the basement of the [[Iglesia Ni Cristo Central Office]] in Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. Shortly afterwards, it acquired a new frequency, 1460 kHz. On May 10, 1975, DZEM once again moved at the third floor of the Iglesia ni Cristo Development Center Building at [[Carlos Palanca]] St., [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]]. After a month, it also altered its frequency to 1360&nbsp;kHz. Then on November 1978, as a result of band adjustments, DZEM had again changed its frequency to 1422&nbsp;kHz due to the switch of the Philippine AM dial from the NARBA-mandated 10&nbsp;kHz spacing to the 9&nbsp;kHz rule implemented by the [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975]]. On May 9, 1985, the station found a new home \u2013 the third floor of Maligaya Building 2 at 887 [[Epifanio delos Santos Avenue|EDSA]], Quezon City. It acquired the frequency of 954&nbsp;kHz on April 27, 1987, which it still uses today.

One of Brecht's most-important [[Marxist aesthetics|aesthetic]] innovations prioritised ''[[Refunctioning|function]]'' over the sterile [[Dichotomy|dichotomical opposition]] between ''form'' and ''content''.<ref name=\"willett281\">Willett (1964) 281.</ref> Epic theatre and its many forms is a response to [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of \"[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]\", or \"total artwork\", which intends each piece of art is composed of each other art form.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Leitmotiv and Drama|last=Brown|first=Hilda Meldrum|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref> Since epic theatre is so focused on the specific relationship between form and content, these two ideas contradict each other, despite the fact that Brecht was heavily influenced by Wagner. Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work \"[[A Short Organum for the Theatre]]\".<ref name=\"Organum\">Brecht (1949, 276).</ref>  Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it.\n\nNear the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term \"dialectical theatre\" to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term \"epic theatre\" had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to [[Manfred Wekwerth]], one of Brecht's directors at the [[Berliner Ensemble]] at the time, the term refers to the \"'[[Dialectics#Marxist dialectics|dialecticising]]' of events\" that this approach to theatre-making produces.<ref name=\"willett282\">Quoted by Willett (1964) 282.</ref>\n\nEpic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] approach and later \"[[Realism (theatre)|psychological realism]]\" developed by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of [[melodrama]]; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of [[Stanislavski's system]] and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht's own social and political focus was distinct, too, from [[surrealism]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of [[Antonin Artaud]], who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced 'shock' in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension.\n\n==Techniques==\n===''Verfremdungseffekt''===\nWhile not invented by Brecht, the ''[[Distancing effect|Verfremdungseffekt]]'', known in English as the \"estrangement effect\" or the \"alienation effect\", was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of epic theatre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schall|first1=Ekkehard|title=The Craft of Theatre: Seminars and Discussions in Brechtian Theatre|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781474243308|page=205}}</ref>  \n\nSome of the ways the ''Verfremdungseffekt'' can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and \"break the [[fourth wall]]\" by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality.\n\nAs with the principle of [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]] involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls \"[[non-Aristotelian drama]]\", the epic approach to play production utilizes a [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interruptions]]. While the French playwright [[Jean Genet]] articulates a very different [[world view]] in his dramas from that found in Brecht's, in a letter to the [[Theatre director|director]] [[Roger Blin]] on the most appropriate approach to staging his ''[[The Screens]]'' in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production:\n\n{{quote|Each scene, and each section within a scene, must be perfected and played as rigorously and with as much discipline as if it were a short play, complete in itself. Without any smudges. And without there being the slightest suggestion that another scene, or section within a scene, is to follow those that have gone before.<ref>Genet (1966, 25).</ref>}}\n\n===Historicisation===\nHistoricisation is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' and ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'', both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library}}</ref> \n\nBrecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a [[music hall]] turn that is able to stand on its own.\nCommon production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic [[scenic design]] offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] to [[Distancing effect|distance]] his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers,  putting music and song in his plays.\n\nActing in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have \"become\" the characters. This is called Gestus, when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character (\"breaking the fourth wall\") and play multiple roles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library}}</ref> Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another.
