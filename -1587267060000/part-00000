Other original investors of Ramada Inns included Isbell's brother-in-law Bill Helsing; Max Sherman, a produce operator from Chicago dubbed \"The Tomato King\"; Chicago attorneys Ezra Ressman and Mort Levin; and Frank Lichtenstein and Robert Rosow of [[San Antonio, Texas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEarly in 1952, Marion W. Isbell received a phone call from his brother-in-law, Bill Helsing. Bill informed him of a hotel deal in Flagstaff, AZ that he was going to invest in and wanted to know if Marion would be interested in joining him. This first investment resulted in a rapid return of capital.\n\nRamada opened its first hotel, a 60-room facility, on [[U.S. Route 66]] at [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] in 1954 and set up its headquarters in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where the chain built the Sahara Hotel on North 1st Street downtown in 1956 (which later became the Ramada Inn Downtown) and a 300-room Ramada Inn in the 3800 block of East Van Buren in 1958 that would become the chain's flagship property and headquarters. Like his contemporary, [[Holiday Inn]] hotel-chain founder [[Kemmons Wilson]], Isbell devised the idea of building and operating a chain of roadside motor hotels when, while on a cross-country trip with his wife Ingrid and their three children, he noted the substandard quality of roadside motor courts along US highways at the time. He saw the possibility in the developing market for a chain of roadside motor hotels conveniently located along major highways which would provide lodgings with hotel-like quality at near-motel rates plus amenities such as [[TV]], [[air conditioning]], swimming pools, and on-premises restaurants.\n\nFrom its start in the 1950s until around 1976, Ramada's logo featured a friendly bald innkeeper, dubbed \"Uncle Ben\". He sported an apron (later a suit and tie) and held a top hat in one hand; in the other hand was a red trumpeted banner that read \"Ramada Inn Roadside Hotels\". From 1976 to 1982, the chain's logo was a simple rounded rectangle that read \"Ramada Inn\" in the original design's gothic Western-style lettering. of the original design. From 1982 to 2004, Ramada changed to a revised, rounded rectangular design with more \"modern\" lettering.\n\nAt one point the chain was owned by ''Ramada Inns, Inc.'', a holding company set up by Isbell to oversee Ramada's various divisions including hotel operations, franchising, real estate, and equipment purchasing. Under Isbell's leadership, Ramada grew into one of the nation's largest lodging chains during the 1960s and 1970s with 100 Ramada Inns in operation by 1964, which grew to 250 in 1970 and nearly 650 by 1976.  By the late 1970s, Ramada ranked as the second-largest hotel chain in the U.S. behind industry leader Holiday Inn. Also during the 1970s, Ramada expanded into worldwide operation by opening new hotels in various European nations and on other continents.\n\nMarion W. Isbell served as president and CEO of Ramada until 1970, when he resigned the presidency and turned it over to his son, William M. Isbell. The senior Isbell continued as the chain's CEO until his retirement in 1972, then Chairman of the Board until 1979. William M. Isbell would serve as Ramada's president and CEO until 1981.\n\nRamada developed a chain of in-hotel restaurants similar to the [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants, operating them under various names including Uncle Ben's Kitchen, Ramada Pancake Cottage, and Chez Bon, as well as other names used by individual franchises. The company-owned Ramada restaurants became defunct in 1990, though the franchised hotels still include on-premises restaurants.\n\n===Split of hotel and casino operations===\nIn an attempt to revive the company's lagging business in 1989, ''Ramada Inns, Inc.'' decided to split its hotel/restaurant businesses and its gaming businesses. The Ramada hotels and restaurants were sold for $540 million to [[New World Development|New World Development Company]] and the gaming business which included the [[Tropicana Las Vegas]], [[Tropicana Atlantic City]], and [[Tropicana Express Hotel and Casino|Ramada Express]] in [[Laughlin, Nevada]], were spun off to a new company called [[Aztar|Aztar Corporation]]. In the original deal for the gaming business, Ramada shareholders were to get $7 in cash per share plus half a share of the new Aztar Corporation.  However, this changed quickly to a new deal where shareholders would receive $1 per share plus one share of Aztar Corporation.  In the late 1990s, Ramada was sold to [[Cendant|Cendant Corporation]] of [[New York, New York|New York City]].\n\nIn February 2018, Interstate Europe Hotels & Resorts took over the management of Ramada Encore hotel, Bournemouth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/520376/interstate-to-manage-ramada-encore-bournemouth|title=Interstate to Manage Ramada Encore Bournemouth|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==Hotel tiers==\nThe chain offers different hotel \"tiers\" based on price and services offered.<ref>[http://www.ramada.com/Ramada/control/president_letter?intcmp=about_us_page_presidents_letter Ramada: President's letter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Ramada Limited\u2014budget-oriented properties, typically with no on-site restaurant, though a pool and deluxe continental breakfast are standard.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown. Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Muk\u00e9 and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000\u201317,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000\u20133,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam Northern Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}} The gendarmes in the Congo-Rhodesia border region would go into Rhodesian communities to barter for food and sometimes raid and steal supplies. Since most of the local Rhodesian residents were Lunda, many of the Lunda Katangese avoided the ANC security operations by simply disguising themselves in the indigenous communities.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nTshombe's Katangese government had enjoyed close relations with the administrators of Portuguese Angola, particularly since both were opposed to communism. Nevertheless, the Portuguese were initially overwhelmed by the large number of gendarmes and mercenaries that arrived under Schramme. As the Congolese government had given backing to the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], a nationalist anti-colonial rebel group, the Portuguese concluded that the gendarmes could serve as a counterweight to nationalist agitation and accommodated them in [[Luena, Angola|Luso]]. As more gendarmes gathered in Angola in late 1963, additional camps were established at Cazambo, Cazage, Lutai, and Lunguebungo. Mindful of the international ramifications of harbouring an armed group, the Portuguese portrayed the gendarmes and mercenaries as \"refugees\".{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} While most of the standard personnel lived in squalor and lacked basic necessities, the officers were kept in hotel rooms paid for by Tshombe. A new command structure was established for the Gendarmerie in Angola under Major Ferdinand Tshipola with Antoine Mwambu as chief of staff. Four groups operated autonomously under their own mercenary commanders. Schramme completely rejected Tshipola's authority.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} \n\nBy 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} \n\nAround April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} By 1965 the rebellions had been largely quelled largely due to the success of the former gendarmes and mercenaries.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}} The use of mercenaries bothered President Kasa-Vubu, which created divisions with the commander of the ANC, [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who appreciated their effectiveness. Kasa-Vubu also developed a rivalry with Tshombe, and in October 1965 dismissed him from the premiership. Political deadlock ensued as Parliament refused to approve Kasa-Vubu's new appointee to the premiership, and in November Mobutu launched a coup and assumed the presidency.<ref>{{cite news| title = Congo : Ringing the Changes| newspaper = Arab Observer| date = 6 December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yl08AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The mercenaries retained significant political distance from Mobutu's new regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, all the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Though the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Organisation of African Unity]] Secretary General [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by mercenary [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967. Called \"Operation Luciver\", ex-gendarmes  crossed from Angola to Katanga and occupied Kisenge and Mutshatsha before being defeated by the ANC.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Gendarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201349}} In March the army seized Manono.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}\n\nThe Gendarmerie then shifted their focus to Kabalo, where they chiefly intended to secure the railway.{{sfn|Higgins|1980|p=417}} The town was garrisoned by two companies of an Ethiopian battalion serving with ONUC.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} On 7 April a Katangese plane carrying 30 mercenaries landed to secure the airstrip in the town but they were promptly arrested by the ONUC troops.{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} Katangese forces moving by land attacked ONUC soldiers and fought with BALUBAKAT partisans.

Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. At the same time the United Nations attempted to suppress foreign support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers.

After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while mercenary Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury.

On 8 February 1963, General Muk\u00e9 and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000\u201317,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000\u20133,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam Northern Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}} The gendarmes in the Congo-Rhodesia border region would go into Rhodesian communities to barter for food and sometimes raid and steal supplies. Since most of the local Rhodesian residents were Lunda, many of the Lunda Katangese avoided the ANC security operations by simply disguising themselves in the indigenous communities.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nTshombe's Katangese government had enjoyed close relations with the administrators of Portuguese Angola, particularly since both were opposed to communism. Nevertheless, the Portuguese were initially overwhelmed by the large number of gendarmes and mercenaries that arrived under Schramme. As the Congolese government had given backing to the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], a nationalist anti-colonial rebel group, the Portuguese concluded that the gendarmes could serve as a counterweight to nationalist agitation and accommodated them in [[Luena, Angola|Luso]]. As more gendarmes gathered in Angola in late 1963, additional camps were established at Cazambo, Cazage, Lutai, and Lunguebungo. Mindful of the international ramifications of harbouring an armed group, the Portuguese portrayed the gendarmes and mercenaries as \"refugees\".{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} While most of the standard personnel lived in squalor and lacked basic necessities, the officers were kept in hotel rooms paid for by Tshombe. A new command structure was established for the Gendarmerie in Angola under Major Ferdinand Tshipola with Antoine Mwambu as chief of staff. Four groups operated autonomously under their own mercenary commanders. Schramme completely rejected Tshipola's authority.{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} \n\nBy 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} \n\nAround April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} By 1965 the rebellions had been largely quelled largely due to the success of the former gendarmes and mercenaries.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}} The use of mercenaries bothered President Kasa-Vubu, which created divisions with the commander of the ANC, [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who appreciated their effectiveness. Kasa-Vubu also developed a rivalry with Tshombe, and in October 1965 dismissed him from the premiership. Political deadlock ensued as Parliament refused to approve Kasa-Vubu's new appointee to the premiership, and in November Mobutu launched a coup and assumed the presidency.<ref>{{cite news| title = Congo : Ringing the Changes| newspaper = Arab Observer| date = 6 December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yl08AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The mercenaries retained significant political distance from Mobutu's new regime.

A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes.

At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Organisation of African Unity]] Secretary General [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo.

Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. However, this is not really considered a competitive honour as it is essentially a friendly game and there is a history of both teams being accredited a win when the result is a draw.<ref name=rsssfShield/> The Football League created its own [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knockout]] competition in 1960, the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].

Regional competitions are organised by County Football Associations. In the years when league football was unavailable or only available to northern and midlands clubs, the county competitions coexisted with the FA Cup as the main tournaments for clubs. Nowadays, county cups are contested by lower or regional division teams and those that still participate generally field youth or reserve sides.

Among FIFA and UEFA competitions, these are the [[UEFA Champions League]], the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], the [[UEFA Europa League]], the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].

[[Super Cup]]s here consist of the honours that have or had only two participating clubs per season. These are the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], the [[UEFA Super Cup]], the [[FA Community Shield]] and its precursor the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]]. The [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] is also listed as a super cup because it only had two clubs competing per season.\n\n''Last updated on 1 March 2020, following the [[2019\u201320 EFL Cup]].''\n==FIFA and UEFA==\n{{further|List of UEFA club competition winners}}\n[[File:2005 trophy cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[UEFA Champions League]] trophy.

Clubs in ''italics'' are [[Double (association football)|Double]] winners: they have won two or more of these trophies in the same season (excluding super cups). Trophies that were shared between two clubs are counted as honours for both teams. Clubs tied in total honours are listed chronologically by most recent honour won. See the other tables for breakdowns of each competition won.\n\nCups here are competitions with a [[Tournament#Knockout|knockout]] format. Among FIFA and UEFA competitions, these are the [[UEFA Champions League]], the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], the [[UEFA Europa League]], the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. Among top-qualifying competitions overseen by The FA, these are the top division, the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], the [[Full Members Cup]], the [[Football League Super Cup]] and the [[Football League Centenary Trophy]]. [[Super Cup]]s here consist of the honours that have or had only two participating clubs per season. These are the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], the [[UEFA Super Cup]], the [[FA Community Shield]] and its precursor the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]]. The [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] is also listed as a super cup because it only had two clubs competing per season.\n\n''Last updated on 1 March 2020, following the [[2019\u201320 EFL Cup]].''\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable mw-datatable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Combined Totals of English Men's Clubs\n! colspan=\"1\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"F.A., E.F.L. and P.L.
