''Babylon 5'' was an early example of a television series featuring story arcs which spanned episodes or whole seasons. Whereas contemporary television shows tended to confine conflicts to individual episodes, maintaining the overall status quo, each season of ''Babylon 5'' contains plot elements which permanently change the series universe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-babylon-5-5876320|title=Everything You Need To Know About Babylon 5|last=Shankel|first=Jason|date=January 18, 2012|website=io9|language=en-US|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> ''Babylon 5'' utilized multiple episodes to address the repercussions of some plot events or character decisions, and episode plots would at times reference or be influenced by events from prior episodes or seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/44949-babylon-5-streaming-amazon-prime|title=The Most Important Sci-Fi Show of the '90s Hits Amazon Prime in June|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=February 16, 2019|quote=in the Nineties it was still exceedingly rare for a TV show to have episodes directly lead into each other.

But, Babylon 5 changed all that.}}</ref>\n\nMany races of sentient creatures are seen frequenting the station, with most episodes drawing from a core of around a dozen species. Major plotlines included ''Babylon 5'''s embroilment in a millennia-long cyclical conflict between ancient, powerful races, inter-race wars and their aftermaths, and intrigue or upheaval within particular races, including the human characters who fight to resist Earth's descent into [[totalitarianism]]. Many episodes focus on the effect of wider events on individual characters, with episodes containing themes such as personal change, loss, subjugation, corruption, defiance, and redemption.\n\n==Setting==\n''Babylon 5'', set primarily between the years 2257 and 2262, depicts a future where Earth has a unifying [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)#Early development|Earth government]] and has gained the technology for [[faster-than-light]] travel. Colonies within the solar system, and beyond, make up the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], which has established contact with other [[Spacefaring#Spacefaring in popular culture|spacefaring]] species. Ten years before the series is set, Earth itself was nearly defeated in a war with the spiritual [[Minbari]], only to escape destruction when the Minbari unexpectedly surrendered at the brink of victory; since then, Earth has established peaceful relationships with them.\n\nAmong the other species are the imperialist [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]]; the [[Narn]], who only recently gained independence from the Centauri empire; and the mysterious, powerful [[Vorlon]]s. Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] also have diplomatic contact with the major races, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]]. An ancient and secretive race, the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], unknown to humans but documented in many other races' religious texts, malevolently influence events to bring chaos and war among the known species.\n\nThe [[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|''Babylon 5'' space station]] is located in the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system, at the [[Trojan (celestial body)|fifth Lagrangian point]] between the fictional planet Epsilon III and its moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/universe/station-1.html|title=Babylon 5 Universe: The Station|author=Straczynski, J.

Each season shares its title with an episode that is central to that season's plot.\n\n=== Season 1: Signs and Portents (1994) ===\nSinclair, the commander of ''Babylon 5'', is a hero of the Minbari war, troubled by his inability to remember events of the war\u2019s last day. Though supported by Minbari ambassador Delenn, who is secretly a member of the Minbari ruling Grey Council, other Minbari remain distrustful of him. The Narn have recently succeeded in regaining their independence from Centauri, and Centauri ambassador Mollari finds a new ally in the enigmatic Mr. Morden to strike back at the Narn. Xenophobic groups on Earth challenge humanity's contact with aliens, and President Santiago, who has favored such contact, is assassinated.\n\n=== Season 2: The Coming of Shadows (1994\u20131995) ===\nSinclair is transferred to be ambassador to Minbar, and Sheridan is assigned command of the station. He and Delenn believe Santiago's death is part of a conspiracy as now-president Clark takes steps to isolate Earth and install a totalitarian government. The aging Centauri Emperor dies, and against his wishes, Mollari and his ally Lord Refa replace him with his unstable nephew Cartagia. Aided by Morden's allies, the Shadows, the Centauri initiate a full-scale attack on the Narn homeworld, re-conquering it. Vorlon ambassador Kosh requests Sheridan's help to fight the Shadows.\n\n=== Season 3: Point of No Return (1995\u20131996) ===\nSheridan and Delenn establish a \"conspiracy of light\" to fight the influence of the Shadows. When Clark declares martial law, Sheridan declares ''Babylon 5'''s independence from Earth government. Mollari realizes his deal with Morden has become dangerous but is unable to end it. Sinclair travels back in time to become Valen, the legendary Minbari religious leader. In retaliation for involving the Vorlons in the war, Kosh is killed by the Shadows. Despite Kosh's warnings, Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum, the Shadow homeworld, and crashes a spacecraft filled with explosives on it, seemingly dying in the explosion.\n\n=== Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat (1996\u20131997) ===\nSheridan is rescued from Z'ha'dum by the mysterious Lorien. With the Shadows in retreat, the Vorlons further their efforts to destroy any species touched by the Shadows. Mollari overthrows Cartagia with the aid of Narn ambassador G\u2019Kar. Sheridan discovers the Vorlons and Shadows have used the younger races in a [[proxy war]], and convinces both sides to stop the war and leave the younger races in peace. Sheridan leads Minbar, Centauri, and Narn to form a new Interstellar Alliance. With their help, Sheridan is able to free Earth from control of President Clark and install a new, more peaceful regime.\n\n=== Season 5: The Wheel of Fire (1998) ===\nA group of rogue human telepaths take sanctuary on the station, seeking Sheridan\u2019s aid to escape the control of Psi Corps, the autocratic Earth agency that oversees telepaths. Remnants of the Shadows' allies attempt to break up the Alliance by setting the various races against each other, and manipulate events on Centauri to install Mollari as Emperor but under their control. Mollari withdraws Centauri from the Alliance. Twenty years later, Sheridan has a last reunion with his friends before leaving to join Lorien and the older races \"beyond the rim\". No longer needed, ''Babylon 5'' is decommissioned and scuttled.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nHaving worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of \"[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week\", a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name=\"GEnie-1992\">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document -->|url=http://www.midwinter.com/b5/GEnie/jms92-04|title=Babylon 5 (GEnie) posts by JMS for April, 1992|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Warner Bros. had remained skeptical about the show even after greenlighting the pilot. According to Straczynski, Warner Bros. had three main concerns: that American attention spans were too short for a series-long narrative to work, that it would be difficult to sell the show into [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] as the syndicate networks would air the episodes out of order, and that no other science-fiction television show outside of ''Star Trek'' had gone more than three seasons before it was cancelled.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.newsarama.com/44664-jms-revisits-babylon-5-on-show-s-25th-anniversary.html | title = JMS Revisits BABYLON 5 On Show's 25th Anniversary | first  = Jonathan | last = Encarnacion | date=  April 8, 2019 | accessdate = April 12, 2019 | work = [[Newsarama]] }}</ref> Straczynski had proved out that the syndication fear was incorrect, since syndicate stations told him they show their shows in episode order to track broadcasts for royalties; however, he could not assure Warner Bros. about the attention span or premature cancellation concerns, but still set out to show Warner Bros. they were wrong.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/>\n\n=== Writing ===\nStraczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of ''Babylon 5'', including all 44 episodes in the third and fourth seasons<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 |title=Writers/Directors list (JMS entry) |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/making/write-direct.html#JMichaelStraczynski |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref>, a feat never before accomplished in American television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jmsnews.com/messages/message?id=13039|title=Re: ATTN: JMS I heard that with you writing the entire season, you will be the 1st in tv history?|last=Straczynski|first=J.

This also made it a challenge for the actors, as to understand motivations without being told what those were driving towards; Straczynski said \"I didn\u2019t want to tell them too much, because that risks having them play the result, rather than the process.\"<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/> He recalled that Peter Jurasik had asked him about the scene from \"[[Midnight on the Firing Line]]\" where Londo and G'Kar are choking themselves to death, as to determine the context of the scene, and Straczynsky had to be coy with this.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/>\n\nDuring production of the fourth season, the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]], which Warner Bros. opted to use for ''Babylon 5'', was shut down, leaving the planned fifth season in doubt. Unwilling to short-change fans of the show,  Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season that would allow him to conclude his overall arc should a fifth season not be greenlit, which ultimately became the direction the fourth season took. Straczynski identified three primary [[narrative thread]]s which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth\u2013Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/Messages/Message?id=10251|title=Year 4/5|last=Straczynski|first=J.

The conflict between the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which [[weapons of mass destruction]] are employed to subjugate and enslave a planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prague Spring#Invasion|invasion of Prague]], the intent was to recreate these moments when \"the world held its breath\" and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jmsnews.com/messages/message?id=16470|title=Coming of Shadows *SPOILERS*|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Seasons 2 and 4 followed, but with the decision to halt production due to a drop in sales, precipitated by rumors of a pending DVD release, only the first twelve episodes of Season 2 and the first six episodes of Season 4 were ultimately released.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babylon 5: The Gathering / In The Beginning|author=Germano, Derek M|year=2001|url=http://www.thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm|publisher=thecinemalaser.com|accessdate=January 11, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230075959/http://thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm|archivedate=December 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|''Laserdiscs (Image Entertainment)''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Volume / Title''' || Release Date\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.01 The Gathering || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.02 Midnight On Firing Line / Soul Hunter || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.03 Born to the Purple / Infection || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.04 Parliament of Dreams / Mind War || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.05 The War Prayer / The Sky Full of Stars || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.06 Deathwalker / Believers || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.07 Survivors / By Any Means Necessary || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.08 Signs & Portents / TKO || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.09 Grail / Eyes || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.10 Legacies / Voice in the Wilderness #1 || {{dts|1999-04-20}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.11 Voice in Wilderness #2 / Babylon Squared || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.12 The Quality of Mercy / Chrysalis || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.00 Points of Departure / Revelations || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.01 The Geometry of Shadows / A Distant Star || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.02 The Long Dark / Spider in the Web || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Due to a numbering issue, no Vol. 2.03 exists.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.04 A Race Through Dark Places / Soul Mates || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.05 The Coming of Shadows / Gropos || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.06 All Alone in the Night / Acts of Sacrifice || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 2 episodes 13 through 22 were never released on laserdisc.''\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 3 was never released on laserdisc.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 4.01 Hour of the Wolf / Whatever Happened To Mr Garibaldi?

The telefilms were later individually released in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|region 2]] in April 2002, though some markets received the original version of ''The Gathering'' in identical packaging.\n\nDVD boxed sets of the individual seasons, each containing six discs, began being released in October 2002. Each included a printed booklet containing episode summaries, with each disc containing audio options for German, French, and English, plus [[wikt:Special:Search/subtitle|subtitles]] in a wider range of languages, including Arabic and Dutch. Video was digitally remastered from original broadcast masters and displayed in [[anamorphic widescreen]] with remastered and remixed [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] sound. Disc 1 of each set contained an introduction to the season by [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski]], while disc 6 included [[featurettes]] containing interviews with various production staff, as well as information on the [[fictional universe]], and a [[gag reel]]. Three episodes in each season also contained commentary from either Straczynski, members of the main cast, and/or the episode director.\n\nSince its initial release, a number of repackaged DVD boxed sets have been produced for various [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|regional markets]]. With slightly altered [[cover art]], they included no additional content, but the discs were more securely stored in slimline cases, rather than the early \"book\" format, with hard plastic pages used during the original release of the first three seasons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Initial DVD release'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Episode box sets''' || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]]\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete First Season || Nov 5, 2002 || Oct 28, 2002 || Nov 27, 2002\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Second Season || April 29, 2003 || May 26, 2003 || Jul 9, 2003\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Third Season || Aug 12, 2003 || Nov 10, 2003 || Dec 19, 2003\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em\" align=\"left\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season || Jan 6, 2004 || April 19, 2004 || Aug 19, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fifth Season || April 13, 2004 || Jan 2005 || Dec 16, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Universe (inc. all movies and Crusade episodes)|| N/A || October 24, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Movie releases and box sets'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering / In the Beginning || Dec 4, 2001 || N/A || Nov 21, 2001\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: In the Beginning || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Movie Collection || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || Mar 2, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: Movie Box Set || N/A || Feb 21, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers || March 14, 2006 || Oct 24, 2005 || Nov 16, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Lost Tales || July 31, 2007 || Sep 3, 2007 || Jan 2, 2008\n|}\n\n=== Mastering problems ===\nWhile the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3 aspect ratio]] to the [[widescreen]] formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions.

''Babylon 5'' was an early example of a television series featuring story arcs which spanned episodes or whole seasons. Whereas contemporary television shows tended to confine conflicts to individual episodes, maintaining the overall status quo, each season of ''Babylon 5'' contains plot elements which permanently change the series universe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-babylon-5-5876320|title=Everything You Need To Know About Babylon 5|last=Shankel|first=Jason|date=January 18, 2012|website=io9|language=en-US|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> ''Babylon 5'' utilized multiple episodes to address the repercussions of some plot events or character decisions, and episode plots would at times reference or be influenced by events from prior episodes or seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/44949-babylon-5-streaming-amazon-prime|title=The Most Important Sci-Fi Show of the '90s Hits Amazon Prime in June|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=February 16, 2019|quote=in the Nineties it was still exceedingly rare for a TV show to have episodes directly lead into each other. Two-part episodes were a big deal, and season long story arcs (with the obvious exception of daytime soap operas) were unheard of. But, Babylon 5 changed all that.}}</ref>\n\nMany races of sentient creatures are seen frequenting the station, with most episodes drawing from a core of around a dozen species. Major plotlines included ''Babylon 5'''s embroilment in a millennia-long cyclical conflict between ancient, powerful races, inter-race wars and their aftermaths, and intrigue or upheaval within particular races, including the human characters who fight to resist Earth's descent into [[totalitarianism]]. Many episodes focus on the effect of wider events on individual characters, with episodes containing themes such as personal change, loss, subjugation, corruption, defiance, and redemption.\n\n==Setting==\n''Babylon 5'', set primarily between the years 2257 and 2262, depicts a future where Earth has a unifying [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)#Early development|Earth government]] and has gained the technology for [[faster-than-light]] travel. Colonies within the solar system, and beyond, make up the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], which has established contact with other [[Spacefaring#Spacefaring in popular culture|spacefaring]] species.

Each season shares its title with an episode that is central to that season's plot.\n\n=== Season 1: Signs and Portents (1994) ===\nSinclair, the commander of ''Babylon 5'', is a hero of the Minbari war, troubled by his inability to remember events of the war\u2019s last day. Though supported by Minbari ambassador Delenn, who is secretly a member of the Minbari ruling Grey Council, other Minbari remain distrustful of him. The Narn have recently succeeded in regaining their independence from Centauri, and Centauri ambassador Mollari finds a new ally in the enigmatic Mr. Morden to strike back at the Narn. Xenophobic groups on Earth challenge humanity's contact with aliens, and President Santiago, who has favored such contact, is assassinated.\n\n=== Season 2: The Coming of Shadows (1994\u20131995) ===\nSinclair is transferred to be ambassador to Minbar, and Sheridan is assigned command of the station. He and Delenn believe Santiago's death is part of a conspiracy as now-president Clark takes steps to isolate Earth and install a totalitarian government. The aging Centauri Emperor dies, and against his wishes, Mollari and his ally Lord Refa replace him with his unstable nephew Cartagia. Aided by Morden's allies, the Shadows, the Centauri initiate a full-scale attack on the Narn homeworld, re-conquering it. Vorlon ambassador Kosh requests Sheridan's help to fight the Shadows.\n\n=== Season 3: Point of No Return (1995\u20131996) ===\nSheridan and Delenn establish a \"conspiracy of light\" to fight the influence of the Shadows. When Clark declares martial law, Sheridan declares ''Babylon 5'''s independence from Earth government. Mollari realizes his deal with Morden has become dangerous but is unable to end it. Sinclair travels back in time to become Valen, the legendary Minbari religious leader. In retaliation for involving the Vorlons in the war, Kosh is killed by the Shadows. Despite Kosh's warnings, Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum, the Shadow homeworld, and crashes a spacecraft filled with explosives on it, seemingly dying in the explosion.\n\n=== Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat (1996\u20131997) ===\nSheridan is rescued from Z'ha'dum by the mysterious Lorien. With the Shadows in retreat, the Vorlons further their efforts to destroy any species touched by the Shadows. Mollari overthrows Cartagia with the aid of Narn ambassador G\u2019Kar. Sheridan discovers the Vorlons and Shadows have used the younger races in a [[proxy war]], and convinces both sides to stop the war and leave the younger races in peace. Sheridan leads Minbar, Centauri, and Narn to form a new Interstellar Alliance. With their help, Sheridan is able to free Earth from control of President Clark and install a new, more peaceful regime.\n\n=== Season 5: The Wheel of Fire (1998) ===\nA group of rogue human telepaths take sanctuary on the station, seeking Sheridan\u2019s aid to escape the control of Psi Corps, the autocratic Earth agency that oversees telepaths. Remnants of the Shadows' allies attempt to break up the Alliance by setting the various races against each other, and manipulate events on Centauri to install Mollari as Emperor but under their control. Mollari withdraws Centauri from the Alliance. Twenty years later, Sheridan has a last reunion with his friends before leaving to join Lorien and the older races \"beyond the rim\". No longer needed, ''Babylon 5'' is decommissioned and scuttled.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nHaving worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of \"[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week\", a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name=\"GEnie-1992\">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document -->|url=http://www.midwinter.com/b5/GEnie/jms92-04|title=Babylon 5 (GEnie) posts by JMS for April, 1992|last=Straczynski|first=J.

According to Straczynski, Warner Bros. had three main concerns: that American attention spans were too short for a series-long narrative to work, that it would be difficult to sell the show into [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] as the syndicate networks would air the episodes out of order, and that no other science-fiction television show outside of ''Star Trek'' had gone more than three seasons before it was cancelled.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.newsarama.com/44664-jms-revisits-babylon-5-on-show-s-25th-anniversary.html | title = JMS Revisits BABYLON 5 On Show's 25th Anniversary | first  = Jonathan | last = Encarnacion | date=  April 8, 2019 | accessdate = April 12, 2019 | work = [[Newsarama]] }}</ref> Straczynski had proved out that the syndication fear was incorrect, since syndicate stations told him they show their shows in episode order to track broadcasts for royalties; however, he could not assure Warner Bros. about the attention span or premature cancellation concerns, but still set out to show Warner Bros. they were wrong.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/>\n\n=== Writing ===\nStraczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of ''Babylon 5'', including all 44 episodes in the third and fourth seasons<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 |title=Writers/Directors list (JMS entry) |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/making/write-direct.html#JMichaelStraczynski |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref>, a feat never before accomplished in American television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jmsnews.com/messages/message?id=13039|title=Re: ATTN: JMS I heard that with you writing the entire season, you will be the 1st in tv history?|last=Straczynski|first=J.

This also made it a challenge for the actors, as to understand motivations without being told what those were driving towards; Straczynski said \"I didn\u2019t want to tell them too much, because that risks having them play the result, rather than the process.\"<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/> He recalled that Peter Jurasik had asked him about the scene from \"[[Midnight on the Firing Line]]\" where Londo and G'Kar are choking themselves to death, as to determine the context of the scene, and Straczynsky had to be coy with this.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/>\n\nDuring production of the fourth season, the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]], which Warner Bros. opted to use for ''Babylon 5'', was shut down, leaving the planned fifth season in doubt. Unwilling to short-change fans of the show,  Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season that would allow him to conclude his overall arc should a fifth season not be greenlit, which ultimately became the direction the fourth season took. Straczynski identified three primary [[narrative thread]]s which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth\u2013Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/Messages/Message?id=10251|title=Year 4/5|last=Straczynski|first=J.

As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as \"surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors\", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]]'s purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt \"Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker.\"<ref name=\"Bruice2\"/>\n\nNormally there were three changes of costume for the primary actors; one for on set, one for the stunt double and one on standby in case of \"coffee spills\". For human civilians, garments were generally purchased [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-rack]] and altered in various ways, such as removing lapels from jackets and shirts while rearranging [[Hook-and-eye closure|closures]], to suggest future fashions. For some of the main female characters a more [[Haute couture|couture]] approach was taken, as in the suits worn by [[Talia Winters]] which Bruice described as being designed and fitted to within \"an inch of their life\". Costumes for the destitute residents of downbelow would be distressed through a combination of bleaching, sanding, dipping in dye baths and having stage blood added.<ref name=\"Bruice1\"/>\n\nLike many of the crew on the show, members of the costume department made onscreen [[Cameo appearance|cameos]]. During the season 4 episode \"[[Atonement (Babylon 5)|Atonement]]\", the tailors and costume supervisor appeared as the Minbari women fitting [[Zack Allan]] for his new uniform as the recently promoted head of security. His complaints, and the subsequent stabbing of him with a needle by costume supervisor Kim Holly, was a light-hearted reference to the previous security uniforms, a design carried over from the pilot movie which were difficult to work with and wear due to the combination of leather and wool.<ref name=\"Kim1\"/>\n\n=== Prosthetic makeup and animatronics ===\nWhile the original pilot film featured some [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] which were puppets and [[animatronics]], the decision was made early on in the show's production to portray most alien species as [[humanoid]] in appearance.

One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the [[SMPTE timecode]]. The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio.\n\nA total of 24 episode and three television film soundtracks were released under Franke's record label, Sonic Images Records, between 1995 and 2001. These contain the musical scores in the same chronological order as they played in the corresponding episodes, or television films. Three compilation albums were also produced, containing extensively re-orchestrated and remixed musical passages taken from throughout the series to create more elaborate suites.

Garibaldi is a relapsing-remitting alcoholic, who practices complete [[abstinence]] throughout most of the series until the [[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|middle of season five]], only recovering at the end of the season. [[Zack Allan]], his eventual replacement as chief of security, was given a second chance by Garibaldi after overcoming his own addiction to an unspecified drug. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Stephen Franklin]] develops an addiction to injectable [[stimulant]] drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab, and takes a leave of absence from his position to recover. Executive Officer [[Susan Ivanova]] mentions that her father became an alcoholic after her mother's suicide. Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] tells Garibaldi that her father was an alcoholic, and that she is a recovering alcoholic herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveS05E19TheWheelOfFire|title=Babylon Five S 05 E 19 The Wheel Of Fire / Recap|last=|first=|date=|website=TV Tropes|access-date=February 19, 2019|quote=...children of alcoholics usually wind up one of two ways, either they try to help everybody else because they couldn't help themselves, or they become alcoholics.

Straczynski has stated that there was no intent to wholly represent any particular period of history or preceding work of fiction, but has acknowledged their influence on the series, insamuch as it uses similar well established storytelling structures, such as the [[Hero's journey|Hero's Journey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/find/Usenet/jms95-03-usenet/142.html|title=Usenet post by JMS|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Straczynski links the incident which sparked the Earth-Minbari war, in which actions are misinterpreted during a tense situation, to a sequence in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', in which a standoff between two armies turns violent when innocent actions are misinterpreted as hostile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/031.html|title=Guide Page: \"The Coming of Shadows\"|last=|first=|date=July 13, 2004|website=The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5|access-date=February 8, 2019|quote=The G'Kar-Emperor thread was similar to the King Arthur legend: Arthur's and Mordred's armies are poised for battle but make one last attempt to negotiate, but a soldier raises his sword to kill a snake and everyone attacks.

Gemellus, co-heir of the previous emperor Tiberius and therefore rival of Caligula, has a persistent cough.

Several episodes have titles which refer to the Christian faith, such as \"[[Passing Through Gethsemane]]\", \"[[A Voice in the Wilderness (Babylon 5)|A Voice in the Wilderness]],\" and \"[[And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place]],\" the latter being a line from the [[Gospel music|gospel song]] \"There's no Hiding Place Down Here.\"  The monks led by [[Brother Theo]] who, in the episode \"[[Convictions (Babylon 5)|Convictions]],\" take up residence on Babylon 5, belong to the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican Order]], a Roman Catholic mendicant  Order.\n\n== Use of the Internet ==\n{{Main|Babylon 5's use of the Internet}}\nThe show employed Internet marketing to create a buzz among online readers far in advance of the airing of the pilot episode,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jmsnews.com/messages/message?id=20359|title=Passage through jumpgates|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Many retrospectives, while criticising virtually every individual aspect of the production, have praised the series as a whole for its narrative cohesion and contribution to serialized television.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2014/05/15/why-babylon-5-is-the-best-and-worst-television-science-fiction-show-ever-made/|title=Why Babylon 5 is the Best - and Worst - Television Science Fiction Show Ever Made|last=Kelly|first=Tod|date=May 15, 2014|website=Ordinary Times|language=en-US|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eugenia.queru.com/2011/02/03/a-second-look-at-babylon-5/|title=A second look at Babylon 5|date=February 4, 2011|website=Eugenia's Rants and Thoughts|language=en-US|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvewlsh.com/news/if-you-go-to-zhadum-you-will-die-or-rewatching-babylon-5-remembering-harlan-ellison/|title=If You Go to Z'Ha'Dum, You Will Die; or, Rewatching Babylon 5, Remembering Harlan Ellison|last=Walsh|first=Dave|date=August 2, 2018|website=Dave Walsh, Writer, Dude|language=en-US|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Giesbrecht |first1=Jennifer |title=Babylon 5 Is the Greatest, Most Terrible SF Series |url=https://www.tor.com/2019/06/13/babylon-5-is-the-greatest-most-terrible-sf-series/ |accessdate=15 June 2019 |work=[[Tor.com]] |date=13 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics|DC]] began publishing [[Babylon 5 novels, short stories and comic books#Comic books|''Babylon 5'' comics]] in 1994, with stories (initially written by Straczynski) that closely tied in with events depicted in the show, with events in the comics eventually being referenced onscreen in the actual television series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guide to DC's Babylon 5 comic|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/comic/index.html|publisher=The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref> The [[Media franchise#Development to other forms|franchise]] continued to expand into short stories, RPGs, and novels, with the [[Technomage#In books|Technomage trilogy]] of books being the last to be published in 2001, shortly after the spin-off television series, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', was cancelled.

A number of short stories and novels were also produced between 1995 and 2001. Additional books were published by the gaming companies Chameleon Eclectic and [[Mongoose Publishing]], to support their desk-top strategy and [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] games.\n\nThree tv films were released by [[TNT (American TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT) in 1998, after funding a fifth season of ''Babylon 5'', following the demise of the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] the previous year. In addition to ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'', ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'', and ''[[Babylon 5: The River of Souls|The River of Souls]]'', they released a re-edited special edition of the original 1993 tv film, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]''. In 1999, a fifth tv film was also produced, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]'', which acted as a pilot movie for the spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which TNT cancelled after 13 episodes had been filmed.\n\n[[Dell Publishing]] started publication of a series of ''Babylon 5'' novels in 1995, which were ostensibly considered canon within the TV series' continuity, nominally supervised by Straczynski, with later novels in the line being more directly based upon Straczynski's own notes and story outlines. In 1997, [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] obtained the publication license from Warner Bros., and proceeded to release a number of original trilogies directly scenarized by Straczynski, as well as novelizations of three of the TNT telefilms (''In the Beginning, Thirdspace'', and ''A Call to Arms''). All of the Del Rey novels are considered completely canonical within the filmic ''Babylon 5'' universe.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] purchased the rights to rerun the ''Babylon 5'' series, and premiered a new telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|The Legend of the Rangers]]'' in 2002, which failed to be picked up as a series. In 2007, the first in a planned anthology of straight-to-DVD short stories entitled, ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|The Lost Tales]]'', was released by [[Warner Home Video]], but no others were produced, due to funding issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/messages/message?id=3681|title=from jms: update|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Beginning with the original telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]'', these were [[PAL]] tapes, showing video in the same [[Aspect ratio (image)#Current video standards|4:3 aspect ratio]] as the initial television broadcasts. By the release of Season 2, tapes included [[closed captioning]] of dialogue and [[Dolby Surround]] sound. [[Columbia House]] began distributing [[NTSC]] tapes, via mail order in 1997, followed by repackaged collector's editions and three-tape [[box sets|boxed sets]] in 1999, by which time the original pilot telefilm had been replaced by the re-edited TNT special edition. Additional movie and complete season boxed-sets were also released by Warner Bros. until 2000.\n\n[[Image Entertainment]] released ''Babylon 5'' [[laserdiscs]] between December 1998 and September 1999. Produced on double-sided 12-inch [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] discs, each contained two episodes displayed in the 4:3 broadcast aspect-ratio, with Dolby Surround audio and closed captioning for the dialogue. Starting with two TNT telefilms, ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'' and the re-edited special edition of ''The Gathering'', Seasons 1 and 5 were released simultaneously over a six-month period. Seasons 2 and 4 followed, but with the decision to halt production due to a drop in sales, precipitated by rumors of a pending DVD release, only the first twelve episodes of Season 2 and the first six episodes of Season 4 were ultimately released.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babylon 5: The Gathering / In The Beginning|author=Germano, Derek M|year=2001|url=http://www.thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm|publisher=thecinemalaser.com|accessdate=January 11, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230075959/http://thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm|archivedate=December 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|''Laserdiscs (Image Entertainment)''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Volume / Title''' || Release Date\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.01 The Gathering || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.02 Midnight On Firing Line / Soul Hunter || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.03 Born to the Purple / Infection || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.04 Parliament of Dreams / Mind War || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.05 The War Prayer / The Sky Full of Stars || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.06 Deathwalker / Believers || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.07 Survivors / By Any Means Necessary || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.08 Signs & Portents / TKO || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.09 Grail / Eyes || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.10 Legacies / Voice in the Wilderness #1 || {{dts|1999-04-20}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.11 Voice in Wilderness #2 / Babylon Squared || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.12 The Quality of Mercy / Chrysalis || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.00 Points of Departure / Revelations || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.01 The Geometry of Shadows / A Distant Star || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.02 The Long Dark / Spider in the Web || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Due to a numbering issue, no Vol. 2.03 exists.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.04 A Race Through Dark Places / Soul Mates || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.05 The Coming of Shadows / Gropos || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.06 All Alone in the Night / Acts of Sacrifice || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 2 episodes 13 through 22 were never released on laserdisc.''\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 3 was never released on laserdisc.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 4.01 Hour of the Wolf / Whatever Happened To Mr Garibaldi?

The telefilms were later individually released in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|region 2]] in April 2002, though some markets received the original version of ''The Gathering'' in identical packaging.\n\nDVD boxed sets of the individual seasons, each containing six discs, began being released in October 2002. Each included a printed booklet containing episode summaries, with each disc containing audio options for German, French, and English, plus [[wikt:Special:Search/subtitle|subtitles]] in a wider range of languages, including Arabic and Dutch. Video was digitally remastered from original broadcast masters and displayed in [[anamorphic widescreen]] with remastered and remixed [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] sound. Disc 1 of each set contained an introduction to the season by [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski]], while disc 6 included [[featurettes]] containing interviews with various production staff, as well as information on the [[fictional universe]], and a [[gag reel]]. Three episodes in each season also contained commentary from either Straczynski, members of the main cast, and/or the episode director.\n\nSince its initial release, a number of repackaged DVD boxed sets have been produced for various [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|regional markets]]. With slightly altered [[cover art]], they included no additional content, but the discs were more securely stored in slimline cases, rather than the early \"book\" format, with hard plastic pages used during the original release of the first three seasons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Initial DVD release'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Episode box sets''' || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]]\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete First Season || Nov 5, 2002 || Oct 28, 2002 || Nov 27, 2002\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Second Season || April 29, 2003 || May 26, 2003 || Jul 9, 2003\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Third Season || Aug 12, 2003 || Nov 10, 2003 || Dec 19, 2003\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em\" align=\"left\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season || Jan 6, 2004 || April 19, 2004 || Aug 19, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fifth Season || April 13, 2004 || Jan 2005 || Dec 16, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Universe (inc. all movies and Crusade episodes)|| N/A || October 24, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Movie releases and box sets'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering / In the Beginning || Dec 4, 2001 || N/A || Nov 21, 2001\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: In the Beginning || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Movie Collection || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || Mar 2, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: Movie Box Set || N/A || Feb 21, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers || March 14, 2006 || Oct 24, 2005 || Nov 16, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Lost Tales || July 31, 2007 || Sep 3, 2007 || Jan 2, 2008\n|}\n\n=== Mastering problems ===\nWhile the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3 aspect ratio]] to the [[widescreen]] formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions.

The screenplay is written by Damon and Krasinski based on a story by [[Dave Eggers]]. ''Promised Land'' follows two petroleum landmen who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy [[drilling rights]] from the local residents.\n\nDamon was originally attached to direct the film, but he was replaced by Van Sant. Filming took place mainly in [[Pittsburgh]] from early to mid-2012. During filming and afterward, the film's highlighting of the resource extraction process [[hydraulic fracturing]], known as \"fracking,\" emerged as a topic of debate.\n\nThe film had a limited release in the United States on {{nowrap|December 28}}, 2012 and followed with a nationwide expansion on {{nowrap|January 4}}, 2013. The film had its international premiere and received Special Mention Award at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, although the [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2012#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2012]], and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $8 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Butler ([[Matt Damon]]) has caught the eyes of top management at his employer, Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that specializes in obtaining natural gas trapped underground through a process known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Butler has an excellent track record for quickly and cheaply persuading land owners to sign mineral rights leases that grant drilling rights over to his employer. Butler and his partner Sue Thomason ([[Frances McDormand]]) arrive in an economically struggling Pennsylvania farming town whose citizens are proud of having family farms passed from one generation to the next.\n\nComing from a town and a life very similar to that of the people he is now determined to win over on behalf of Global, Butler tells the story of how his own town died after the local [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] assembly plant closed. The idea of a town surviving solely on family farms being passed down through generations as a viable economy is one that he can no longer accept. He claims to be offering the town its last chance. Butler spends some pleasant after-hours time with Alice ([[Rosemarie DeWitt]]), a teacher he meets in a bar.\n\nThe community seems willing to accept Global's offer, until an elderly, local high school science teacher, Frank Yates ([[Hal Holbrook]]), who happened to be a successful engineer in his working life, raises the question of the safety of fracking during a town meeting. It's decided that the people will vote in a few weeks whether or not to take the offer. After hearing about the vote, Dustin Noble ([[John Krasinski]]), an unknown environmental advocate, starts a grassroots campaign against Global, motivated by a tale of his family losing its Nebraska dairy farm after the herd died as a result of Global's industry-standard fracking process.\n\nButler begins to meet a great deal of resistance in town. Noble seems to be winning over nearly everyone, including Alice. One night Butler receives a package from Global that includes an enlarged copy of a photograph of dead cattle on a field that Noble said came from his family's Nebraska farm. The enlargement shows that an object thought to be a silo is, in fact, a lighthouse, which are nonexistent in Nebraska, revealing that Noble fabricated his story and deceived the people. Actually, the picture was from [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where Global is in the midst of a lawsuit over environmental complications that were probably caused by their fracking practices.\n\nButler informs the town's mayor of the deception, who then informs the rest of the town. He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette. Butler realizes the only way Noble could have known this information is if he were also employed by Global, and that Noble's job had been to discredit the environmental movement and convince the town to vote in favor of Global's offer. He arranged for Butler to receive the \"confidential\" photos and engineered the entire public relations effort.\n\nAt a town meeting the next day, the citizens are prepared to vote on Global's efforts to buy drilling rights to their property. Butler talks to them about how the barn in the picture reminds him of his grandfather's barn. He reveals that Noble has manipulated them and is employed by Global. Butler leaves the meeting to find Thomason on the phone with Global. She tells him he's fired and that she is leaving for New York. Butler walks to Alice's home and she welcomes him in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Steve Butler\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Dustin Noble\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Sue Thomason\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Alice\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jeff Dennon\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Drew Scott\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as Rob\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as David Churchill\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Frank Yates\n* [[Sara Lindsey]] as Claire Allen\n* [[Lucas Black]] as Paul Geary\n\n==Production==\n''Promised Land'' is directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Damon]] and [[John Krasinski]], who are film producers along with [[Chris Moore (film producer)|Chris Moore]].

The screenplay is written by Damon and Krasinski based on a story by [[Dave Eggers]]. ''Promised Land'' follows two petroleum landmen who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy [[drilling rights]] from the local residents.\n\nDamon was originally attached to direct the film, but he was replaced by Van Sant. Filming took place mainly in [[Pittsburgh]] from early to mid-2012. During filming and afterward, the film's highlighting of the resource extraction process [[hydraulic fracturing]], known as \"fracking,\" emerged as a topic of debate.\n\nThe film had a limited release in the United States on {{nowrap|December 28}}, 2012 and followed with a nationwide expansion on {{nowrap|January 4}}, 2013. The film had its international premiere and received Special Mention Award at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, although the [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2012#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2012]], and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $8 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Butler ([[Matt Damon]]) has caught the eyes of top management at his employer, Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that specializes in obtaining natural gas trapped underground through a process known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Butler has an excellent track record for quickly and cheaply persuading land owners to sign mineral rights leases that grant drilling rights over to his employer. Butler and his partner Sue Thomason ([[Frances McDormand]]) arrive in an economically struggling Pennsylvania farming town whose citizens are proud of having family farms passed from one generation to the next.\n\nComing from a town and a life very similar to that of the people he is now determined to win over on behalf of Global, Butler tells the story of how his own town died after the local [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] assembly plant closed. The idea of a town surviving solely on family farms being passed down through generations as a viable economy is one that he can no longer accept. He claims to be offering the town its last chance. Butler spends some pleasant after-hours time with Alice ([[Rosemarie DeWitt]]), a teacher he meets in a bar.\n\nThe community seems willing to accept Global's offer, until an elderly, local high school science teacher, Frank Yates ([[Hal Holbrook]]), who happened to be a successful engineer in his working life, raises the question of the safety of fracking during a town meeting. It's decided that the people will vote in a few weeks whether or not to take the offer. After hearing about the vote, Dustin Noble ([[John Krasinski]]), an unknown environmental advocate, starts a grassroots campaign against Global, motivated by a tale of his family losing its Nebraska dairy farm after the herd died as a result of Global's industry-standard fracking process.\n\nButler begins to meet a great deal of resistance in town. Noble seems to be winning over nearly everyone, including Alice. One night Butler receives a package from Global that includes an enlarged copy of a photograph of dead cattle on a field that Noble said came from his family's Nebraska farm. The enlargement shows that an object thought to be a silo is, in fact, a lighthouse, which are nonexistent in Nebraska, revealing that Noble fabricated his story and deceived the people. Actually, the picture was from [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where Global is in the midst of a lawsuit over environmental complications that were probably caused by their fracking practices.\n\nButler informs the town's mayor of the deception, who then informs the rest of the town. He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette. Butler realizes the only way Noble could have known this information is if he were also employed by Global, and that Noble's job had been to discredit the environmental movement and convince the town to vote in favor of Global's offer. He arranged for Butler to receive the \"confidential\" photos and engineered the entire public relations effort.\n\nAt a town meeting the next day, the citizens are prepared to vote on Global's efforts to buy drilling rights to their property. Butler talks to them about how the barn in the picture reminds him of his grandfather's barn. He reveals that Noble has manipulated them and is employed by Global. Butler leaves the meeting to find Thomason on the phone with Global. She tells him he's fired and that she is leaving for New York. Butler walks to Alice's home and she welcomes him in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Steve Butler\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Dustin Noble\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Sue Thomason\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Alice\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jeff Dennon\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Drew Scott\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as Rob\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as David Churchill\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Frank Yates\n* [[Sara Lindsey]] as Claire Allen\n* [[Lucas Black]] as Paul Geary\n\n==Production==\n''Promised Land'' is directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Damon]] and [[John Krasinski]], who are film producers along with [[Chris Moore (film producer)|Chris Moore]].

Lindau belongs to the [[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]] (municipality) of [[Katlenburg-Lindau]] and to the [[Landkreis]] (district) of [[Northeim]]. The village is known to many [[space physics|space physicists]] and [[radio engineering|radio engineers]] around the world, as the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] (known as \"Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy\" until June 2004) was based there until 2014, when it moved to [[G\u00f6ttingen]], also in Lower Saxony.<ref name=\"Neubau\">[http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau 'Neubau'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821094557/http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau |date=2015-08-21 }} on MPS website, viewed 2014-07-09</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLindau lies on an area of level farmland between the [[Oder (Harz)|Oder]] and [[Rhume]] rivers.\n\n==History==\n\nLindau was mentioned in writing for the first time in 1184. Around 1322 [[Otto II of Woldenberg]], [[bishop of Hildesheim]],  established the ''[[Muthaus]]'', today the oldest building of the municipality of ''Gemeinde'' Katlenburg-Lindau, and in which the Lindau administration was accommodated until 1741.\n\nIn the 19th Century Lindau's economy grew with a [[jute]] spinning mill set up by the Greve company (1872) and the brewery.\n\n===The fire of Easter 1911===\n\nIn the afternoon of 15 April 1911, [[Easter]] Sunday, Lindau experienced its largest and most devastating fire. In a farmyard in the ''Unterflecken'' area of the village, two boys had made a fire. Since it was very windy, the fire spread to the farm buildings and those of a bricklayer. Primitive [[fire fighting]] equipment and the distance from the local river led to the entire Unterflecken being burnt. Sparks ignited other houses and stored chemicals exploded.\n\n42 houses and 30 auxiliary buildings were destroyed and many were never rebuilt. In the village marketplace the ''Mariendenkmal'' monument was erected. In the same year, a local [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[fire brigade]] was established.\n\n===Weimar Republic (1918-1933)===\n\nLindau's predominantly [[catholic]] population influenced the village's voting pattern . (A [[census]] from the year 1934 indicated there were 1487 inhabitants, of whom 85.5% were Catholic, only 14.5% [[Lutheran]] while no [[Jewish]] inhabitants were recorded.)\n\nThe ''[[Zentrumspartei]]'' [[centrist]]  party, abbreviated 'Zentrum', held a special supremacy in the district during the period of the [[Weimar Republic]]. In 1920 Zentrum gained 69.8% of Lindau's [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] votes. This high vote was maintained through all the years of the Weimar Republic until 1932, when with the last free elections this party still gained 60.8% of the vote while in many other places the [[Nazi Party]] had  long been the strongest political power.\nThe Nazis recorded just two votes (0.3%) for the first time in 1928 and were insignificant at first in subsequent years. In November 1932 the Nazis were no longer to be ignored, at 21.9% the second strongest party in Lindau after the Zentrum. A local Nazi group formed in 1930 (the district's first had been formed in 1925 in [[Duderstadt]]).\n\nThe last months of the Weimar Republic were shaped by violent political arguments in Lindau, with many party meetings and banners in the village. A news item from this time reports that a Lindau [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] member was hurt \u201cby a political opponent, with a key, on the head.\u201d\n\n===Lindau during national socialism (1933-1945)===\n\nNo documents remain from the March 1933 elections, but it is assumed that Lindau voted along customary lines. At first the Lindau population remained sceptically opposed to the new ruling powers. However, the [[Reichskonkordat|concordat]] between the German Reich and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] encouraged many Catholic voters. Gradually national socialism became acceptable among them.\n\nIn May 1933 the first Nazi mayor was appointed. The municipality had no more influence on policy. The new ruling powers determined everything.\n\nIn November of the same year Reichstag elections took place. However it was only possible to vote 'yes' or 'no'. With these elections 910 Lindauers voted for the Nazis: 98%. Only 19 voters (approx 2%) were either invalid or 'no' votes.\n\n[[Job creation]] measures led to new roads and more people. Among other things in 1938 the market place was paved and was used as a stage for many [[demonstration (people)|political demonstration]]s.\n\nThe economy flourished, the Greve string factory for example got many orders from the armed forces during preparations for the Second World War.\n\n===Second World War (1939-1945)===\nAn early influence of the outbreak of [[World War II]] was the arrival of women and children from large cities of the [[Saarland]] in December 1939.\n\nDuring the war many [[prisoners of war]] came to Lindau, among others Frenchmen and Poles, who were used in [[agriculture]].\n\nIn 1945 a group of [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canadian airmen]] crashed.\n\nThe Second World War cost 111 Lindau soldiers' lives, nearly twice as high as the casualties in the [[First World War]] of 1914-1918.\n\n===The post-war period (1945-1949)===\n\nOne of the first steps after the end of the war was the release of [[prisoners of war]]. In June 1945 approximately 200 [[United Kingdom|British]] personnel were deployed in Lindau after the Americans had left and they remained until 1946.\n\nGradually life in Lindau began to normalise. On 3 June a new [[kindergarten]] was inaugurated and on 5 June the public library, after all National Socialist material had been removed, opened in the parsonage building.\nThe school suffered from a shortage of teachers and textbooks \"For learning books the school children possess nothing except for a [[Bible]], [[Catechism]] and maybe a [[Anthology|reader]],\" wrote a teacher at that time.\n\nBetween the English occupiers and the Lindau population there existed a good relationship. The British held [[friendly match]]es with the FC Lindau [[soccer]] club.\n\nAfter the war a [[research]] institute relocated to Lindau, where buildings of the [[Leibniz University Hannover|Technical University of Hannover]] already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. This was to become the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]].\n\nOn 16 March 1946 the village school converted back into a [[catholic school]] after 88% of parents voted for this. However the [[Protestant]] children got their own [[religious education]].\n\nThe high number of [[refugees]] from the large cities was problematic. Food, accommodation and work were scarce. The number of refugees constantly increased, bringing the population to 2400. All houses were heavily occupied, and the relationship between Lindauers and refugees was not always good.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1948 the ''Fleckenstra\u00dfe'' road was paved, and the church tower was repaired in 1948.\n\n===Development from 1949 until today===\n[[Image:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research.JPG|thumb|375px|right|The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] became a significant component of the village, attracting many international visitors]]\n\nAfter the Second World War Lindau developed to the north and the entire infrastructure was improved.\n\nIn 1957 the village got a multipurpose hall, (reconditioned in 2006). A new [[elementary school]] was established in 1965 which serves today as a [[Hauptschule]] and [[Realschule]]. A new [[kindergarten]] was built in 1969. Lindau got its own sports field, and a new fire station was built in 1971 as well as asphalted roads equipped with modern lighting.\n\nIn 1969 Lindau joined the ''Rhumetal'' district drainage project, completed in 1976.\n\nOn 1 January 1973 as part of administrative reform of [[Lower Saxony]] the district of [[Duderstadt]] was dissolved, from which Lindau was placed in [[Landkreis]] [[Northeim (district)]]. Lindau also lost the status of a municipality as together with six other villages the united municipality ''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]] [[Katlenburg-Lindau]]'' was created.

Lindau belongs to the [[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]] (municipality) of [[Katlenburg-Lindau]] and to the [[Landkreis]] (district) of [[Northeim]]. The village is known to many [[space physics|space physicists]] and [[radio engineering|radio engineers]] around the world, as the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] (known as \"Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy\" until June 2004) was based there until 2014, when it moved to [[G\u00f6ttingen]], also in Lower Saxony.<ref name=\"Neubau\">[http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau 'Neubau'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821094557/http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau |date=2015-08-21 }} on MPS website, viewed 2014-07-09</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLindau lies on an area of level farmland between the [[Oder (Harz)|Oder]] and [[Rhume]] rivers.\n\n==History==\n\nLindau was mentioned in writing for the first time in 1184. Around 1322 [[Otto II of Woldenberg]], [[bishop of Hildesheim]],  established the ''[[Muthaus]]'', today the oldest building of the municipality of ''Gemeinde'' Katlenburg-Lindau, and in which the Lindau administration was accommodated until 1741.\n\nIn the 19th Century Lindau's economy grew with a [[jute]] spinning mill set up by the Greve company (1872) and the brewery.\n\n===The fire of Easter 1911===\n\nIn the afternoon of 15 April 1911, [[Easter]] Sunday, Lindau experienced its largest and most devastating fire. In a farmyard in the ''Unterflecken'' area of the village, two boys had made a fire. Since it was very windy, the fire spread to the farm buildings and those of a bricklayer. Primitive [[fire fighting]] equipment and the distance from the local river led to the entire Unterflecken being burnt. Sparks ignited other houses and stored chemicals exploded.\n\n42 houses and 30 auxiliary buildings were destroyed and many were never rebuilt. In the village marketplace the ''Mariendenkmal'' monument was erected. In the same year, a local [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[fire brigade]] was established.\n\n===Weimar Republic (1918-1933)===\n\nLindau's predominantly [[catholic]] population influenced the village's voting pattern . (A [[census]] from the year 1934 indicated there were 1487 inhabitants, of whom 85.5% were Catholic, only 14.5% [[Lutheran]] while no [[Jewish]] inhabitants were recorded.)\n\nThe ''[[Zentrumspartei]]'' [[centrist]]  party, abbreviated 'Zentrum', held a special supremacy in the district during the period of the [[Weimar Republic]]. In 1920 Zentrum gained 69.8% of Lindau's [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] votes. This high vote was maintained through all the years of the Weimar Republic until 1932, when with the last free elections this party still gained 60.8% of the vote while in many other places the [[Nazi Party]] had  long been the strongest political power.\nThe Nazis recorded just two votes (0.3%) for the first time in 1928 and were insignificant at first in subsequent years. In November 1932 the Nazis were no longer to be ignored, at 21.9% the second strongest party in Lindau after the Zentrum. A local Nazi group formed in 1930 (the district's first had been formed in 1925 in [[Duderstadt]]).\n\nThe last months of the Weimar Republic were shaped by violent political arguments in Lindau, with many party meetings and banners in the village. A news item from this time reports that a Lindau [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] member was hurt \u201cby a political opponent, with a key, on the head.\u201d\n\n===Lindau during national socialism (1933-1945)===\n\nNo documents remain from the March 1933 elections, but it is assumed that Lindau voted along customary lines. At first the Lindau population remained sceptically opposed to the new ruling powers. However, the [[Reichskonkordat|concordat]] between the German Reich and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] encouraged many Catholic voters. Gradually national socialism became acceptable among them.\n\nIn May 1933 the first Nazi mayor was appointed. The municipality had no more influence on policy. The new ruling powers determined everything.\n\nIn November of the same year Reichstag elections took place. However it was only possible to vote 'yes' or 'no'. With these elections 910 Lindauers voted for the Nazis: 98%. Only 19 voters (approx 2%) were either invalid or 'no' votes.\n\n[[Job creation]] measures led to new roads and more people. Among other things in 1938 the market place was paved and was used as a stage for many [[demonstration (people)|political demonstration]]s.\n\nThe economy flourished, the Greve string factory for example got many orders from the armed forces during preparations for the Second World War.\n\n===Second World War (1939-1945)===\nAn early influence of the outbreak of [[World War II]] was the arrival of women and children from large cities of the [[Saarland]] in December 1939.\n\nDuring the war many [[prisoners of war]] came to Lindau, among others Frenchmen and Poles, who were used in [[agriculture]].\n\nIn 1945 a group of [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canadian airmen]] crashed.\n\nThe Second World War cost 111 Lindau soldiers' lives, nearly twice as high as the casualties in the [[First World War]] of 1914-1918.\n\n===The post-war period (1945-1949)===\n\nOne of the first steps after the end of the war was the release of [[prisoners of war]]. In June 1945 approximately 200 [[United Kingdom|British]] personnel were deployed in Lindau after the Americans had left and they remained until 1946.\n\nGradually life in Lindau began to normalise. On 3 June a new [[kindergarten]] was inaugurated and on 5 June the public library, after all National Socialist material had been removed, opened in the parsonage building.\nThe school suffered from a shortage of teachers and textbooks \"For learning books the school children possess nothing except for a [[Bible]], [[Catechism]] and maybe a [[Anthology|reader]],\" wrote a teacher at that time.\n\nBetween the English occupiers and the Lindau population there existed a good relationship. The British held [[friendly match]]es with the FC Lindau [[soccer]] club.\n\nAfter the war a [[research]] institute relocated to Lindau, where buildings of the [[Leibniz University Hannover|Technical University of Hannover]] already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. This was to become the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]].\n\nOn 16 March 1946 the village school converted back into a [[catholic school]] after 88% of parents voted for this. However the [[Protestant]] children got their own [[religious education]].\n\nThe high number of [[refugees]] from the large cities was problematic. Food, accommodation and work were scarce. The number of refugees constantly increased, bringing the population to 2400. All houses were heavily occupied, and the relationship between Lindauers and refugees was not always good.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1948 the ''Fleckenstra\u00dfe'' road was paved, and the church tower was repaired in 1948.\n\n===Development from 1949 until today===\n[[Image:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research.JPG|thumb|375px|right|The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] became a significant component of the village, attracting many international visitors]]\n\nAfter the Second World War Lindau developed to the north and the entire infrastructure was improved.\n\nIn 1957 the village got a multipurpose hall, (reconditioned in 2006). A new [[elementary school]] was established in 1965 which serves today as a [[Hauptschule]] and [[Realschule]]. A new [[kindergarten]] was built in 1969. Lindau got its own sports field, and a new fire station was built in 1971 as well as asphalted roads equipped with modern lighting.\n\nIn 1969 Lindau joined the ''Rhumetal'' district drainage project, completed in 1976.\n\nOn 1 January 1973 as part of administrative reform of [[Lower Saxony]] the district of [[Duderstadt]] was dissolved, from which Lindau was placed in [[Landkreis]] [[Northeim (district)]]. Lindau also lost the status of a municipality as together with six other villages the united municipality ''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]] [[Katlenburg-Lindau]]'' was created. Lindau had become part of a predominantly Lutheran area and it is reported that the bell was [[bell ringing|tolled]] at the (catholic) village church.\n\nIn 1983 Lindau joined a [[natural gas]] network while the ''Peter und Paul Kirche'' catholic church was renovated during a seven-year closure.\n\nThe [[mill stream]] created in 1872 by the company Greve for [[water power]] at the oast house was filled in 1984.\n\nIn 1985 Lindau opened a large sportsground with a [[grandstand]] for 250 spectators.\n\nIn 1987 the district of Northeim built a \"center for innovation\" next to the Max Planck Institute, to offer production facilities for [[high tech]] companies.\n\nIn the years 1946, 1947, 1981 and 1994 Lindau was afflicted by heavy [[flood]]ing of the Rhume, which caused severe damage. The flood [[dam]] built in 1995 has so far prevented similar events.\n\nIn 2014, the Max Planck Institute relocated to G\u00f6ttingen.<ref name=\"Neubau\"/>\n\n==Aircraft crash over Lindau==\n\nOn 29 October 1979 just after 5pm a US [[Grumman]] [[OV-1 Mohawk]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] crashed near highway 247 to Bilshausen and set a [[stable]] on fire.

Designers predominantly used [[MOSFET]] transistors with [[pMOS logic]] in the early 1970s, and then predominantly used [[NMOS logic]] from the mid-1970s. They also experimented with various [[word length]]s. Early on, [[4-bit]] processors were common (e.g. Intel 4004). Later in the decade, [[8-bit]] processors such as the [[MOS Technology|MOS]] 6502 superseded the 4-bit chips. [[16-bit]] processors emerged by the decade's end. Some unusual word lengths were tried, including [[12-bit]] and 20-[[bit]]. The 20-bit [[MP944]], designed for the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighter, is considered by its designer to be the first microprocessor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Ray|title=World's First Microprocessor|url=http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com/|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> It was classified by the Navy until 1998, meaning that Intel's 4004 was widely regarded as the first-ever microprocessor.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Processor clock speeds increased by more than tenfold between 1990 and 1999, and [[64-bit]] processors began to emerge later in the decade. In the 1990s, microprocessors no longer used the same clock speed for the processor and the [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Processors began to have a [[front-side bus]] (FSB) clock speed used in communication with RAM and other components. Typically, the processor itself ran at a clock speed that was a multiple of the FSB clock speed. Intel's Pentium III, for example, had an internal clock speed of 450\u2013600&nbsp;MHz and a FSB speed of 100\u2013133&nbsp;MHz. Only the processor's internal clock speed is shown here.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Date\n! Name\n!

Microprocessor clock speeds reached a ceiling because of the ''[[heat dissipation]] barrier''. Instead of implementing expensive and impractical cooling systems, manufacturers turned to [[parallel computing]] in the form of the [[multi-core processor]]. [[Overclocking]] had its roots in the 1990s, but came into its own in the 2000s. Off-the-shelf cooling systems designed for overclocked processors became common, and the [[Gaming computer|gaming PC]] had its advent as well. Over the decade, transistor counts increased by about an order of magnitude, a trend continued from previous decades. Process sizes decreased about fourfold, from 180&nbsp;nm to 45&nbsp;nm.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Date\n! Name\n! Developer\n! Clock\n! Process\n!

Designers predominantly used [[MOSFET]] transistors with [[pMOS logic]] in the early 1970s, and then predominantly used [[NMOS logic]] from the mid-1970s. They also experimented with various [[word length]]s. Early on, [[4-bit]] processors were common (e.g. Intel 4004). Later in the decade, [[8-bit]] processors such as the [[MOS Technology|MOS]] 6502 superseded the 4-bit chips. [[16-bit]] processors emerged by the decade's end. Some unusual word lengths were tried, including [[12-bit]] and 20-[[bit]]. The 20-bit [[MP944]], designed for the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighter, is considered by its designer to be the first microprocessor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Ray|title=World's First Microprocessor|url=http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com/|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> It was classified by the Navy until 1998, meaning that Intel's 4004 was widely regarded as the first-ever microprocessor.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

overtook NMOS. [[Transistor count]] increased dramatically during the decade.\n\nThe [[home computer]]s of the 1980s predominantly used processors that were introduced in the 1970s. Versions of the [[MOS Technology|MOS]] 6502, first released in 1975, and the Zilog Z80 (1976), were at the core of many of the home computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[ZX Spectrum]]. Even the first-generation [[IBM PC]] used a processor from the 1970s, the Intel 8088.\n\nIt was not until Intel's 80286 (used in the [[IBM PC/AT]]), and later the 80386, that processors designed in the 1980s drove the computers of the 1980s. These processors offered higher clock speeds and 32-bit word length as well as new operating modes, such as [[protected mode]], that were not available in earlier chips. Critically, protected mode allowed the use of [[virtual memory]] and brought the [[graphical user interface]] to business computers, beginning with [[Windows 2.0]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Processor clock speeds increased by more than tenfold between 1990 and 1999, and [[64-bit]] processors began to emerge later in the decade. In the 1990s, microprocessors no longer used the same clock speed for the processor and the [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Processors began to have a [[front-side bus]] (FSB) clock speed used in communication with RAM and other components. Typically, the processor itself ran at a clock speed that was a multiple of the FSB clock speed. Intel's Pentium III, for example, had an internal clock speed of 450\u2013600&nbsp;MHz and a FSB speed of 100\u2013133&nbsp;MHz. Only the processor's internal clock speed is shown here.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Date\n! Name\n!

Microprocessor clock speeds reached a ceiling because of the ''[[heat dissipation]] barrier''. Instead of implementing expensive and impractical cooling systems, manufacturers turned to [[parallel computing]] in the form of the [[multi-core processor]]. [[Overclocking]] had its roots in the 1990s, but came into its own in the 2000s. Off-the-shelf cooling systems designed for overclocked processors became common, and the [[Gaming computer|gaming PC]] had its advent as well. Over the decade, transistor counts increased by about an order of magnitude, a trend continued from previous decades. Process sizes decreased about fourfold, from 180&nbsp;nm to 45&nbsp;nm.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Date\n! Name\n! Developer\n! Clock\n! Process\n!

Conquistadors like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\n\nIn the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, [[free people of color]], and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taino, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the on of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\n\nBy the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the [[pirate]]s, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony in the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer an economic decline.<ref name=\"google48\">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms on Burial Slab.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Campuzano Polanco family]] coat of arms]]\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)&nbsp;\u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name=\"google48\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic \u2013 THE FIRST COLONY|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n=== French rule ===\n{{Main|Era de Francia}}\n[[File:Battle of Santo Domingo (French and British ships).jpg|thumb|left|French and British ships fighting at the [[Battle of San Domingo]] (1806)]]\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islandwide Struggle for Freedom: Revolution, Emancipation, and Reenslavement in Hispaniola, 1789-1809|page=93}}</ref> The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned.<ref name=\"Short Dominican History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studycountry.com/guide/DO-history.htm|title=A Brief History of Dominican Republic|website=SpainExchange Country Guide}}</ref> In October 1808 the landowner [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez]] began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and British Jamaica.<ref name=\"Bethell\">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/245 245\u201348]}}</ref> The British ejected the French and returned Santo Domingo to the Spaniards in 1809.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.{{efn|''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)}} In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nThe Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.<ref name=\"Matibag\" />{{rp|page number needed}}\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the [[Espa\u00f1a Boba]] period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], or [[Gran Colombia]]. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the [[cibao]] region.

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Encarta\"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\n\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses.

These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 1844\u20131899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}\n[[File:Luperoncaballo.JPG|thumb|[[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]].

In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level),<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the ''[[Sierra de Neiba]]'', while in the south the ''[[Sierra de Bahoruco]]'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'', ''Sierra de Yamas\u00e1'', and ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''.\n\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.\n\nThe ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.\n[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\n\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> Other important lakes are [[Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n]] or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and [[Laguna de Oviedo]], a lagoon with [[brackish water]].\n\nThere are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and [[Beata]], in the southwest. Smaller islands include the [[Cayos Siete Hermanos]], [[Isla Cabra]], [[Cayo Jackson]], [[Cayo Lim\u00f3n]], [[Cayo Levantado]], [[Cayo la Bocaina]], [[Catalina Island (Dominican Republic)|Catalanita]], [[Cayo Pisaje]] and [[Isla Alto Velo]]. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Isla Cabritos]] lies within [[Lago Enriquillo]].\n\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast, triggering a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Dominican Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]\n<!--[[File:Los Haitises Park.jpeg|thumb|Los Haitises Park National Park]]-->\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] in the coastal and lowland areas.

The year-round golf courses are major attractions.<ref name=consulate/> A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, [[Pico Duarte]], and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, [[Lake Enriquillo]].<ref name=\"Baker 2008 190\"/> The island has an average temperature of {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and great climatic and biological diversity.<ref name=\"consulate\"/> The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"Colonial City of Santo Domingo\"/><ref name=\"unesco.org\"/>\n\nTourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\n\n[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian border.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).\n\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;\u2013 Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;\u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]\n{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012.<ref name=\"SD-stats\">{{cite web|url=http://opret.gob.do/Documentos/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20Institucionales/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20de%20peaje%20y%20tiempo%20de%20recorrido%20al%202013.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas de peaje y tiempo de recorrido al 2013|trans-title=Statistics of tolls and times of route 2013|language=es|work=opret.gob.do|page=2|date=September 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref> With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.\n\n=== Communications ===\n{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a well developed [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|telecommunications]] infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\n\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').\n\nThe largest telecommunications company is [[Claro Rep\u00fablica Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;\u2013 part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil]]&nbsp;\u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million.

However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\n\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Ta\u00edno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\n\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Ta\u00edno#Food and agriculture|Ta\u00edno]], and [[African cuisine|African]].

Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and  salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Tostones, a fried plantain dish]]\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables.

Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[To\u00f1o Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chich\u00ed Peralta]].\n\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|378}}\n\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\n\n[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>\n\n[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\n\n[[Dominican rock]] and [[Reggaeton]] are also popular.

The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\").

Conquistadors like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\n\nIn the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, [[free people of color]], and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taino, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the on of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\n\nBy the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the [[pirate]]s, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony in the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer an economic decline.<ref name=\"google48\">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms on Burial Slab.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Campuzano Polanco family]] coat of arms]]\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)&nbsp;\u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name=\"google48\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic \u2013 THE FIRST COLONY|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n=== French rule ===\n{{Main|Era de Francia}}\n[[File:Battle of Santo Domingo (French and British ships).jpg|thumb|left|French and British ships fighting at the [[Battle of San Domingo]] (1806)]]\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islandwide Struggle for Freedom: Revolution, Emancipation, and Reenslavement in Hispaniola, 1789-1809|page=93}}</ref> The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned.<ref name=\"Short Dominican History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studycountry.com/guide/DO-history.htm|title=A Brief History of Dominican Republic|website=SpainExchange Country Guide}}</ref> In October 1808 the landowner [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez]] began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and British Jamaica.<ref name=\"Bethell\">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/245 245\u201348]}}</ref> The British ejected the French and returned Santo Domingo to the Spaniards in 1809.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.{{efn|''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)}} In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nThe Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.<ref name=\"Matibag\" />{{rp|page number needed}}\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the [[Espa\u00f1a Boba]] period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], or [[Gran Colombia]]. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the [[cibao]] region.

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Encarta\"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\n\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses.

These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 1844\u20131899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}\n[[File:Luperoncaballo.JPG|thumb|[[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]].

In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level),<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the ''[[Sierra de Neiba]]'', while in the south the ''[[Sierra de Bahoruco]]'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'', ''Sierra de Yamas\u00e1'', and ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''.\n\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.\n\nThe ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.\n[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\n\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> Other important lakes are [[Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n]] or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and [[Laguna de Oviedo]], a lagoon with [[brackish water]].\n\nThere are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and [[Beata]], in the southwest. Smaller islands include the [[Cayos Siete Hermanos]], [[Isla Cabra]], [[Cayo Jackson]], [[Cayo Lim\u00f3n]], [[Cayo Levantado]], [[Cayo la Bocaina]], [[Catalina Island (Dominican Republic)|Catalanita]], [[Cayo Pisaje]] and [[Isla Alto Velo]]. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Isla Cabritos]] lies within [[Lago Enriquillo]].\n\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast, triggering a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Dominican Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]\n<!--[[File:Los Haitises Park.jpeg|thumb|Los Haitises Park National Park]]-->\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] in the coastal and lowland areas.

The year-round golf courses are major attractions.<ref name=consulate/> A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, [[Pico Duarte]], and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, [[Lake Enriquillo]].<ref name=\"Baker 2008 190\"/> The island has an average temperature of {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and great climatic and biological diversity.<ref name=\"consulate\"/> The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"Colonial City of Santo Domingo\"/><ref name=\"unesco.org\"/>\n\nTourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\n\n[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian border.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).\n\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;\u2013 Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;\u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]\n{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012.<ref name=\"SD-stats\">{{cite web|url=http://opret.gob.do/Documentos/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20Institucionales/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20de%20peaje%20y%20tiempo%20de%20recorrido%20al%202013.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas de peaje y tiempo de recorrido al 2013|trans-title=Statistics of tolls and times of route 2013|language=es|work=opret.gob.do|page=2|date=September 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref> With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.\n\n=== Communications ===\n{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a well developed [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|telecommunications]] infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\n\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').\n\nThe largest telecommunications company is [[Claro Rep\u00fablica Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;\u2013 part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil]]&nbsp;\u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million.

However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\n\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Ta\u00edno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\n\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Ta\u00edno#Food and agriculture|Ta\u00edno]], and [[African cuisine|African]].

Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and  salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Tostones, a fried plantain dish]]\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables.

Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[To\u00f1o Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chich\u00ed Peralta]].\n\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|378}}\n\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\n\n[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>\n\n[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\n\n[[Dominican rock]] and [[Reggaeton]] are also popular.

The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\").
