He held the office for a record 10 years and one month (3,683 days) (taking into account a one-month vacancy in November\u2013December 1966).<ref>[https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/u-thant UN website's biography of Thant]</ref>\n\nA native of [[Pantanaw]], Thant was educated at the National High School and at [[Rangoon University]]. In the days of tense political climate in Burma, he held moderate views positioning himself between fervent nationalists and British loyalists. He was a close friend of Burma's first Prime Minister [[U Nu]] and served in various positions in Nu's cabinet from 1948 to 1961. Thant had a calm and unassuming demeanor that won his colleagues' respect.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}}\n\nHe was appointed as Secretary-General in 1961, when his predecessor [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]] [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|died in an air crash]]. In his first term, Thant facilitated negotiations between U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, helping to avert a global catastrophe. Later, in December that year, Thant ordered [[Operation Grandslam]], which ended a secessionist insurgency in [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Congo]]. He was reappointed as Secretary-General on 2 December 1966 by a unanimous vote of the Security Council. During his second term Thant was well known for publicly criticizing American conduct in the [[Vietnam War]]. He oversaw the entry of several newly independent African and Asian states into the UN. He refused to serve a third term, and retired in 1971.\n\nThant died of [[lung cancer]] in 1974. A devout [[Buddhist]] and the foremost Burmese diplomat on the international stage, he was widely admired and held in great respect by the Burmese populace. When the military government refused him any honours, riots broke out in Rangoon; these were violently crushed by the government, leaving scores of casualties.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:U Thant in 1927.PNG|thumb|left|Thant as a [[Rangoon University]] student in 1927]]\n\nThant, the eldest of four sons, was born in [[Pantanaw]], colonial Burma, to a moderately wealthy family of landowners and rice merchants. His father Po Hnit, who had been educated in [[Calcutta]], was the only person in the town who could communicate well in English.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=29}} He was a founding member of the [[Burma Research Society]] and had helped establish ''[[The Sun (Rangoon)|The Sun]]'' (''Thuriya'') newspaper in Rangoon. {{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=29}}<ref name=\"mm\">{{cite book |title=Dr. Maung Maung: Gentleman, Scholar, Patriot |editor=Robert H.

As a result Thant became an avid reader and his school friends nicknamed him \"The Philosopher\".{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=144}} Apart from reading, he enjoyed various sports including hiking, swimming and playing [[chinlone]].{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=33}} He went to the National High School in Pantanaw. At the age of eleven Thant participated in strikes against the University Act of 1920. He dreamed of becoming a journalist and surprised the family by writing an article for the ''[[Union of Burma Boy Scouts]]'' magazine. When Thant was fourteen, his father died and a series of inheritance disputes forced Thant's mother, Nan Thaung, and her four children into difficult financial times.<ref>Franda, Marcus F. (2006).

Rowman & Littlefield. p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5334-7}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, Thant believed he would not be able to complete a four-year degree and instead worked for a two-year teaching certificate at Rangoon University in 1926. As the eldest son he had to fulfill his filial duties and responsibilities to the family. At university, Thant, together with Nu, the future Prime Minister of Burma, studied history under [[D. G. E. Hall]]. Nu was told by a distant mutual relative to take care of Thant and the two soon became close friends.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=88}} Thant was elected joint secretary of the University Philosophical Association and secretary of the Literary and Debating Society.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=89}} In Rangoon, Thant met [[John Sydenham Furnivall|J.S. Furnivall]], the founder of The Burma Book Club and ''[[The World of Books]]'' magazine, to which Thant regularly contributed. Promising a good post, Furnivall urged Thant to complete four-year university course and join Civil Service but Thant refused.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=93}} After earning the certificate, he returned to Pantanaw to teach at the National High School as a senior teacher in 1928. He contacted Furnivall and Nu regularly, writing articles and participating in ''The World of Books'' translation competitions.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=94}}\n\nIn 1931, Thant won first place in All Burma Teachership Examination and became the school's headmaster by the age of twenty-five.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=97}}{{Sfn|Lewis|2012}} Urged by Thant, his friend Nu took the local superintendent of schools position. Thant regularly contributed to several newspapers and magazines under the pen name \"Thilawa\" and translated a number of books, including one on the [[League of Nations]].<ref>Naing, Saw Yan (January 22, 2009).

They brought Thant to Rangoon to lead the Educational Reorganizing Committee. However, Thant did not have any real power, and returned to Pantanaw. When the Japanese ordered making Japanese compulsory in Pantanaw high schools, Thant defied the orders and cooperated with the growing anti-Japanese resistance.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=145}}\n\nIn 1948, Burma gained independence from the United Kingdom. Nu became the prime minister of the newly independent Burma and appointed Thant as director of broadcasting in 1948. By then, civil war had broken out. The Karen insurgency began and Thant risked his life to go to Karen camps to negotiate for peace. The negotiations broke down, and in 1949 the advancing insurgents burned his hometown, including his house. The insurgents pushed the front to within four miles of the capital Rangoon before they were beaten back. In the following year, Thant was appointed secretary to the government of Burma in the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]]. From 1951 to 1957, Thant was secretary to the prime minister, writing speeches for U Nu, arranging his foreign travel, and meeting foreign visitors. During this entire period, he was U Nu's closest confidant and advisor.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=145}}\n\nHe also took part in a number of international conferences and was the secretary of the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]] in [[Indonesia]], which gave birth to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. From 1957 to 1961, he was Burma's permanent representative to the United Nations and became actively involved in negotiations over [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian independence]]. In 1961, Thant was named Chairman of the UN Congo Commission. The Burmese government awarded him the title ''Maha Thray Sithu'' as a commander in the [[Pyidaungsu Sithu Thingaha|order of Pyidaungsu Sithu]].<ref>H.W. Wilson Company (1962).

The Security Council hurriedly searched for a new Secretary-General, but over the next few weeks it was in a deadlock, with the United States and the Soviet Union unable to agree on any candidate proposed by other members. The superpowers backed down when representatives from smaller nations and the Non-Aligned Movement proposed Thant to fill Hammarskj\u00f6ld's unexpired term.{{Sfn|Lewis|2012}} On 3 November 1961, Thant was unanimously appointed as acting Secretary-General by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], on the recommendation of the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 168|Resolution 168]]. On 30 November 1961, the General Assembly unanimously appointed him secretary-general for a term of office ending on 3 November 1966. During his first term, he was widely credited for his role in defusing the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and for ending the [[Congo Crisis|civil war in the Congo]]. He also said that he wanted to ease tensions between major powers while serving at the UN.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1962/1962-Elections,-Other-Events/12295509437657-7/#title \"1962 In Review].

Kennedy]] during his visit to the UN Headquarters.]]\n\nIn less than one year in office, Thant faced a critical challenge to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis, the moment when the world came closest to a nuclear war. On 20 October 1962, two days before public announcements were made, U.S President [[John F. Kennedy]] showed Thant [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aerial reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile installations in Cuba. The President then ordered a naval \"quarantine\" to remove all offensive weapons from Soviet ships bound for Cuba. Meanwhile, Soviet ships were approaching the quarantine zone. To avoid a naval confrontation, Thant proposed that the U.S should make non-invasion guarantees in exchange for missile withdrawal from the Soviet Union. Soviet Premier Khrushchev welcomed the proposal, which formed the basis of further negotiations.{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2012|p=80}} Khrushchev further agreed to suspend missile shipments while the negotiations were ongoing.<ref name=\"nyt62\">{{cite news |title=Kennedy Agrees to Talks on Thant Plan, Khrushchev Accepts It; Blockade Goes On; Russian Tanker Intercepted and Cleared |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/19/home/crisis-26.html |accessdate=7 April 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 October 1962}}</ref> However, on 27 October 1962, a U-2 plane was shot down over Cuba, deepening the crisis. Kennedy was under intense pressure to invade from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the [[EXCOMM|Executive Committee]] (ExComm). Kennedy hoped Thant would play the role of mediator and subsequently replied to ExComm and the Joint Chiefs, \"On the other hand we have U Thant, and we don't want to sink a ship...right in the middle of when U Thant is supposedly arranging for the Russians to stay out.\"{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2009|p=273}}\n\nNegotiations continued. The U.S agreed to dismantle missiles in Turkey and guaranteed never to invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Thant flew to Cuba and discussed with [[Fidel Castro]] allowing UN missile inspectors and the return of the body of the downed U-2 pilot. Castro, furious that the Soviets had agreed to remove missiles without his knowledge, categorically rejected any UN inspectors, although he did return the pilot's body. The inspection was done at sea by US reconnaissance aircraft and warships. The crisis was resolved and a war between superpowers was averted.{{Sfn|Lewis|2012}}{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2009|p=292}}\n\nAlthough a manifest pacifist and a devout Buddhist, Thant did not hesitate to use force when required. During the Congo Civil War in 1962, Katangan secessionists led by [[Moise Tshombe]] repeatedly attacked UN Operation in the Congo forces (ONUC). In December 1962, after ONUC suffered a sustained four-day attack in Katanga, Thant ordered the \"[[Operation Grandslam]]\" to gain \"complete freedom of movement for ONUC all over Katanga.\" The operation proved to be decisive and ended the secessionist insurgency once and for all. By January 1963, the secessionist capital Elizabethville was under full UN control.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=161}} In his speech at the [[Columbia University]] Thant expressed expectation of completion of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] in mid 1964.<ref name=\"Institut\">Tomanovi\u0107, M.

(in [[Serbo-Croatian]])</ref>\n\nFor his role in defusing the Cuban crisis and other peacekeeping efforts, the Norwegian Permanent Representative of the United Nations informed Thant that he would be awarded the 1965 Nobel Peace prize. He humbly replied, \"Is not the Secretary-General merely doing his job when he works for peace?\"{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}} On the other hand, Chairman [[Gunnar Jahn]] of the Nobel Peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving Thant the prize which was at the last minute awarded to [[UNICEF]]. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to Thant. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to Thant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lundestad |first1=Geir |title=The Nobel Peace Prize, 1901-2000 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/peace/lundestad-review/ |website=nobelprize.org |accessdate=7 April 2018 |quote=In 1965 and 1966 a majority of the committee clearly favored giving the prize to the third Secretary General, U Thant, and even to the first, Norway's Trygve Lie, but chairman Jahn more or less vetoed this.}}</ref> Outraged, Thant's undersecretary and Nobel Prize laureate [[Ralph Bunche]] called Gunnar Jahn's decision \"gross injustice to U Thant.\"{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}}\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1963, intercommunal clashes broke out in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots withdrew into their enclaves, leaving the central government wholly under Greek Cypriot control. A \"peace-making force\" established under British command was unable to put an end to the fighting, and a conference on Cyprus held in London in January 1964 ended in disagreement. On 4 March 1964, amid the danger of broader hostilities, the Security Council unanimously authorized Thant to establish a UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), with a limited three-month mandate to prevent the recurrence of fighting and to restore order. The Council further asked the secretary-general to appoint a mediator to seek a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem. Thant appointed Galo Plaza Lasso as mediator but when his report was rejected by Turkey in March 1965, Plaza resigned and the function of mediator lapsed.<ref name=nc/>\n\nIn April 1964, Thant accepted the [[Holy See]]'s designation of itself as a [[permanent observer]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCann |first1=Eamonn |title=How did the Holy See get recognition as a state?

The UN afterwards stated, \"Because Israel refused to accept UNEF on its territory, the Force had to be deployed only on the Egyptian side of the border, and thus its functioning was entirely contingent upon the consent of Egypt as the host country.

Negotiations conducted by Cyrus Vance for the US and Jos\u00e9 Rolz-Bennett on behalf of the secretary-general led to a settlement. Intercommunal talks began in June 1968, through the good offices of the secretary-general, as part of the settlement.

In 1961, when he was first appointed, the [[Soviet Union]] tried to insist on a ''troika'' formula of three secretaries-general, one representing each [[Cold War]] bloc, to maintain equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the secretary-generalship and his good offices, a clear tribute to Thant's work.{{Sfn|Lewis|2012}}\n\nIn his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary-General Thant stated that he felt a \"great sense of relief bordering on liberation\" on relinquishing the \"burdens of office\".<ref name=\"NYTObit\">{{cite news |last1=Whitman |first1=Alden |title=U Thant Is Dead of Cancer at 65 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/26/archives/u-thant-is-dead-of-cancer-at-65-ut-thant-is-dead-of-cancer-united.html |accessdate=6 April 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 November 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Popham |first1=Peter |title=The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi |date=2011 |publisher=[[Rider Books]] |isbn=978-1-61519-064-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ladypeacocklifeo0000poph/page/224 224]|url=https://archive.org/details/ladypeacocklifeo0000poph |url-access=registration |accessdate=6 April 2018 |quote=Already unwell, he told the General Assembly that he felt \"a great sense of relief, bordering on liberation\" at relinquishing \"the burdens of office\"...}}</ref> In an editorial published around 27 December 1971, praising Thant, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that \"the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement\".

He refused to serve a third term, and retired in 1971.\n\nThant died of [[lung cancer]] in 1974. A devout [[Buddhist]] and the foremost Burmese diplomat on the international stage, he was widely admired and held in great respect by the Burmese populace.

At the age of eleven Thant participated in strikes against the University Act of 1920. He dreamed of becoming a journalist and surprised the family by writing an article for the ''[[Union of Burma Boy Scouts]]'' magazine. When Thant was fourteen, his father died and a series of inheritance disputes forced Thant's mother, Nan Thaung, and her four children into difficult financial times.<ref>Franda, Marcus F. (2006).

As the eldest son he had to fulfill his filial duties and responsibilities to the family. At university, Thant, together with Nu, the future Prime Minister of Burma, studied history under [[D. G. E. Hall]]. Nu was told by a distant mutual relative to take care of Thant and the two soon became close friends.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=88}} Thant was elected joint secretary of the University Philosophical Association and secretary of the Literary and Debating Society.{{Sfn|Bingham|1966|p=89}} In Rangoon, Thant met [[John Sydenham Furnivall|J.S.

They brought Thant to Rangoon to lead the Educational Reorganizing Committee. However, Thant did not have any real power, and returned to Pantanaw. When the Japanese ordered making Japanese compulsory in Pantanaw high schools, Thant defied the orders and cooperated with the growing anti-Japanese resistance.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=145}}\n\nIn 1948, Burma gained independence from the United Kingdom. Nu became the prime minister of the newly independent Burma and appointed Thant as director of broadcasting in 1948. By then, civil war had broken out. The Karen insurgency began and Thant risked his life to go to Karen camps to negotiate for peace. The negotiations broke down, and in 1949 the advancing insurgents burned his hometown, including his house. The insurgents pushed the front to within four miles of the capital Rangoon before they were beaten back. In the following year, Thant was appointed secretary to the government of Burma in the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]]. From 1951 to 1957, Thant was secretary to the prime minister, writing speeches for U Nu, arranging his foreign travel, and meeting foreign visitors.

From 1957 to 1961, he was Burma's permanent representative to the United Nations and became actively involved in negotiations over [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian independence]]. In 1961, Thant was named Chairman of the UN Congo Commission.

On 30 November 1961, the General Assembly unanimously appointed him secretary-general for a term of office ending on 3 November 1966. During his first term, he was widely credited for his role in defusing the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and for ending the [[Congo Crisis|civil war in the Congo]]. He also said that he wanted to ease tensions between major powers while serving at the UN.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1962/1962-Elections,-Other-Events/12295509437657-7/#title \"1962 In Review].

On 20 October 1962, two days before public announcements were made, U.S President [[John F. Kennedy]] showed Thant [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aerial reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile installations in Cuba. The President then ordered a naval \"quarantine\" to remove all offensive weapons from Soviet ships bound for Cuba. Meanwhile, Soviet ships were approaching the quarantine zone. To avoid a naval confrontation, Thant proposed that the U.S should make non-invasion guarantees in exchange for missile withdrawal from the Soviet Union. Soviet Premier Khrushchev welcomed the proposal, which formed the basis of further negotiations.{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2012|p=80}} Khrushchev further agreed to suspend missile shipments while the negotiations were ongoing.<ref name=\"nyt62\">{{cite news |title=Kennedy Agrees to Talks on Thant Plan, Khrushchev Accepts It; Blockade Goes On; Russian Tanker Intercepted and Cleared |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/19/home/crisis-26.html |accessdate=7 April 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 October 1962}}</ref> However, on 27 October 1962, a U-2 plane was shot down over Cuba, deepening the crisis. Kennedy was under intense pressure to invade from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the [[EXCOMM|Executive Committee]] (ExComm). Kennedy hoped Thant would play the role of mediator and subsequently replied to ExComm and the Joint Chiefs, \"On the other hand we have U Thant, and we don't want to sink a ship...right in the middle of when U Thant is supposedly arranging for the Russians to stay out.\"{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2009|p=273}}\n\nNegotiations continued. The U.S agreed to dismantle missiles in Turkey and guaranteed never to invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Thant flew to Cuba and discussed with [[Fidel Castro]] allowing UN missile inspectors and the return of the body of the downed U-2 pilot. Castro, furious that the Soviets had agreed to remove missiles without his knowledge, categorically rejected any UN inspectors, although he did return the pilot's body. The inspection was done at sea by US reconnaissance aircraft and warships. The crisis was resolved and a war between superpowers was averted.{{Sfn|Lewis|2012}}{{Sfn|Dorn & Pauk|2009|p=292}}\n\nAlthough a manifest pacifist and a devout Buddhist, Thant did not hesitate to use force when required. During the Congo Civil War in 1962, Katangan secessionists led by [[Moise Tshombe]] repeatedly attacked UN Operation in the Congo forces (ONUC). In December 1962, after ONUC suffered a sustained four-day attack in Katanga, Thant ordered the \"[[Operation Grandslam]]\" to gain \"complete freedom of movement for ONUC all over Katanga.\" The operation proved to be decisive and ended the secessionist insurgency once and for all. By January 1963, the secessionist capital Elizabethville was under full UN control.{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=161}} In his speech at the [[Columbia University]] Thant expressed expectation of completion of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] in mid 1964.<ref name=\"Institut\">Tomanovi\u0107, M.

(in [[Serbo-Croatian]])</ref>\n\nFor his role in defusing the Cuban crisis and other peacekeeping efforts, the Norwegian Permanent Representative of the United Nations informed Thant that he would be awarded the 1965 Nobel Peace prize. He humbly replied, \"Is not the Secretary-General merely doing his job when he works for peace?\"{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}} On the other hand, Chairman [[Gunnar Jahn]] of the Nobel Peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving Thant the prize which was at the last minute awarded to [[UNICEF]]. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to Thant. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to Thant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lundestad |first1=Geir |title=The Nobel Peace Prize, 1901-2000 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/peace/lundestad-review/ |website=nobelprize.org |accessdate=7 April 2018 |quote=In 1965 and 1966 a majority of the committee clearly favored giving the prize to the third Secretary General, U Thant, and even to the first, Norway's Trygve Lie, but chairman Jahn more or less vetoed this.}}</ref> Outraged, Thant's undersecretary and Nobel Prize laureate [[Ralph Bunche]] called Gunnar Jahn's decision \"gross injustice to U Thant.\"{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}}\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1963, intercommunal clashes broke out in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots withdrew into their enclaves, leaving the central government wholly under Greek Cypriot control. A \"peace-making force\" established under British command was unable to put an end to the fighting, and a conference on Cyprus held in London in January 1964 ended in disagreement. On 4 March 1964, amid the danger of broader hostilities, the Security Council unanimously authorized Thant to establish a UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), with a limited three-month mandate to prevent the recurrence of fighting and to restore order. The Council further asked the secretary-general to appoint a mediator to seek a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem. Thant appointed Galo Plaza Lasso as mediator but when his report was rejected by Turkey in March 1965, Plaza resigned and the function of mediator lapsed.<ref name=nc/>\n\nIn April 1964, Thant accepted the [[Holy See]]'s designation of itself as a [[permanent observer]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCann |first1=Eamonn |title=How did the Holy See get recognition as a state?

Intercommunal talks began in June 1968, through the good offices of the secretary-general, as part of the settlement.

[[Martial law]] was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis\u2014the student-led protests over the shabby treatment of Thant by the Ne Win government\u2014was crushed by the Burmese government.<ref name=at/>\n\nThant's memoirs, ''View from the UN'', were posthumously published, initially by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1978.\n\nIn April 2012, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] paid his respects at U Thant's mausoleum during a visit to Yangon.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:U Thant's family 1964.PNG|350px|thumb|Thant and his family, including brothers Khant Thaung and Tin Maung, his mother Nan Thaung, and his daughter Aye Aye Thant and her husband, Tyn Myint-U, in 1964]]\nThant had three brothers: Khant, Thaung, and Tin Maung.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bingham, June |title=U Thant: The Search For Peace |publisher=Victor Gollancz |year=1966 |page=43}}</ref> He was married to Daw Thein Tin. They had two sons, but lost both; Maung Bo died in infancy, and Tin Maung Thant fell from a bus during a visit to Yangon. Tin Maung Thant's funeral procession, which was attended by dignitaries, was grander than that of the state funeral of Commodore Than Pe, a member of the 17-man [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] and minister of health and education. Thant was survived by a daughter, an adopted son, five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren (three girls and two boys). His only grandson, [[Thant Myint-U]], is a historian and a former senior official in the UN's Department of Political Affairs and the author of ''The River of Lost Footsteps'', in part a biography of Thant.\n\nDuring his tenure as Secretary-General, Thant followed [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports with some interest; in 1967, he arranged for American atmospheric physicist [[James E. McDonald]] to speak before the UN's Outer Space Affairs Group regarding UFOs.<ref>Letter to U Thant / James E. McDonald. \u2013 Tucson, Ariz. : J.E.

He declined Burma's second highest honor awarded to him by U Nu's government in 1961. When he was informed that the 1965 Nobel Prize would instead go to UNICEF due to Chairman Gunnar Jahn's veto, Thant, according to Walter Dorn, \"recorded his pleasure\".{{Sfn|Dorn|2007|p=147}} However, he did accept the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding]] in 1965,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iccrindia.net/jnawardlist.html |title=List of the recipients of the Jawaharlal Nehru Award |publisher=ICCR India |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901175835/http://www.iccrindia.net/jnawardlist.html |archivedate=September 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> the [[Gandhi Peace Award]] in 1972, [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] in 1973 and more than two dozen honorary degrees.\n\nThant received honorary degrees (LL.D) from Carleton University, Williams College, Princeton University, Mount Holyoke College, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, University of California at Berkeley, University of Denver, Swarthmore College, New York University, Moscow University, Queen's University, Colby College, Yale University, University of Windsor, Hamilton College,  Fordham University, Manhattan College, University of Michigan, Delhi University, University of Leeds, Louvain University,  University of Alberta, Boston University, Rutgers University, University of Dublin (Trinity College), Laval University, Columbia University, the University of the Philippines Diliman, and Syracuse University.
