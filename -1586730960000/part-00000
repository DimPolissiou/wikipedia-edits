Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished'.\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\n==Overview==\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> They may, for example, enhance their color,<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/> such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of

Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished'.\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\n==Overview==\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> They may, for example, enhance their color,<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/> such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of

Our determination to ensure that \u2032right is done\u2032 is totally vindicated and a just outcome is now in sight.''</blockquote>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Fordham|first=Michael|title=Judicial Review Handbook|publisher=Hart Publishing Ltd. |date=2012|edition=6th|isbn=9781849461597}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Richard|title=Public Law\u2014Blackstone\u2032s questions & answers|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2015|edition=Eighth|isbn=9780198715733}}\n*{{cite book |last= Endicott |first= Timothy |title= Administrative Law |date= 2011|edition=Second |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6YOcAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA333&ots=fISK8plf4X&dq=%22R%20(March)%22%20%22error%20of%20fact%22&pg=PA334#v=onepage&q=%22R%20(March)%22%20%22error%20of%20fact%22&f=false |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199601752}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Contaminated blood scandal in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Abrogation in Public Law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Law-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Public law]]\n[[Category:Common law]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom public law]]\n[[Category:Law of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Judicial review]]\n", "name_user": "SpookiePuppy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reference 12: changing \"page\" paramter to \"pages\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(March)_v_Secretary_of_State_for_Health"}

He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English  Crown he suffered  considerable hardship  during the [[English Civil War]], and died in poverty.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], probably at [[Merrion Castle]], eldest of the five  sons  of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of [[Wicklow]], and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th [[Viscount Gormanston]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2  p.11</ref> The FitzWilliam family are recorded   in Dublin from about 1210, and by the time of Thomas's  birth they  were among the wealthiest and most influential families in [[the Pale]].\n\n==Early career==\nThomas was only fourteen when his father died.  As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home.  \n\nHe was [[knighted]]  the same year, served as [[Sheriff of County Dublin]]  in 1609,  and in 1610  he received a substantial grant of land in [[County Armagh]].  No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, In  1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes. Reissued  2000 Vol. 5, p. 527</ref> It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money  to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in  protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to  his father's breaking of an [[entail]] on the estates, which benefitted Thomas  at the expense of  his siblings. Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the [[Roman Catholic]]  faith, while adhering in public to the [[Church of Ireland]]; later generations of  Fitzwilliams were quite open in their support for the Catholic  religion.\n\n==Civil war and last years==\nWhen the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the [[Irish Confederacy]].<ref>Ball, p.13</ref> He was one of  only three nobles to offer their assistance in the [[Royalist]] defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He offered his services\nto the  [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lords Justices]], but  despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion,  and he  took no further part in the fighting.  He spent some time in  England, where the King received him courteously.   He was promised an English [[Earldom]],  but the promise was not kept. He returned to Ireland, only to discover that he had been [[outlawed]]]. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living  sometimes at Merrion Castle,  sometimes with his eldest son at [[Howth]], and sometimes in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and  he wrote to  [[ James Butler, 1st Duke  of Ormonde]] in 1647 asking for repayment of a [[debt]]. In 1648 he was promised a [[pension]]  of \u00a3100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.<ref>Ball, p.16</ref>\n\nDue perhaps to the confused conditions of the [[ English Civil War]], little seems to be known about the date and place of his death. Even the year has been disputed, but is generally stated to be 1650. He was certainly dead before 1655 when his eldest surviving son Oliver was allowed to inherit a part of the estates, though most of them were not restored until 1663.<ref>Ball, p.18</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1605 he married Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th [[Baron Louth]] and  his wife Frances, who was the daughter of [[Nicholas Bagenal]] and Eleanor Griffith,   and  sister of [[Henry Bagenal]] and of Mabel, Countess of Tyrone.<ref>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'', p. 527</ref> They had four sons:\n*Richard, who predeceased his father: He married Elizabeth Stanihust but  had no children;\n*[[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]],  who   was married  three times but had no children;\n*Christopher, who lived mainly in England:  he married Jane Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] (whose sister Dorothy was  his brother Oliver's first wife)  and  had one surviving daughter but no son;\n*[[William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam]], ancestor of  all succeeding Viscounts Fitzwilliam.\n\n==Character==\nHis friend [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] described him as a man who was  \"in every way faithful to his allegiance\".<ref>Ball, p.13</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzwilliam, Thomas Fitzwilliam, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1581 births]]\n[[Category:1650 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:People from Mount Merrion]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "'''Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount Fitzwilliam''' (1581\u20131650) was an Irish nobleman of the Stuart age.

As of 2008, Qian is the 96th most common surname in China, shared by 2.2 million people, with the province with the most people sharing the name being [[Jiangsu]], an area formerly within the Wuyue kingdom.<ref name=\"top300\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwan.cn/zppd/XSDG/200901/t20090106_811068.htm|date=2009-01-06|publisher=Taiwan.cn|language=Chinese|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6700\u65b0300\u5927\u59d3\u6392\u540d\uff082008\uff09|trans-title=300 most common surnames in China (2008)|accessdate=2014-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to the [[Song dynasty]] book, ''[[Tongzhi (encyclopedia)|Tongzhi]]'', the Qian surname descends from [[Zhuanxu]], one of the legendary [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]], via Pengzu, the founder of the Peng kingdom in modern-day [[Jiangsu]] during the [[Shang dynasty]]. A [[Zhou dynasty]] official, Fu, was a descendant of Pengzu and served in the royal Treasury, the ''Qianfu'' (\"Money Office\"). His descendants adopted the surname \"Qian\", literally \"money\", from his title.\n\nBeing descendants of the Peng kingdom, the Qian family originally congregated around [[Pizhou|Xiapi]], in modern-day [[Jiangsu]]. The surname spread from there, now has its highest concentration of it in the [[Jiangnan]] region. During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907-960), [[Qian Liu]] and his descendants ruled the independent kingdom of [[Wuyue]] in south-eastern China. Qian Liu had many sons, who were posted to different parts of his kingdom, greatly increasing the density of the Qian surname within the former territory of Wuyue. This area comprises today's [[Zhejiang]], [[Shanghai]], southern [[Jiangsu]] and northern [[Fujian]]. After Wuyue submitted to the [[Song Dynasty]] in 978, the last king moved to [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]], the Song capital in modern-day [[Henan]]. The Qian family was thereafter prominent at the Song court, with Qian Chu's son, Qian Weiyan, serving as a prominent [[Chancellor of China|Chancellor]]. During this period, the Qian family also spread to northern China.\n\n==Notable people==\n\n===Pre-modern===\n* {{ill|Qian Chenqun|zh|\u94b1\u9648\u7fa4}} (1686\u20131774), Qing dynasty minister\n* [[Empress Qian]] (?\u20131468), wife of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] of Ming\n* [[Qian Qi]] (\u9322\u8d77) (710\u2013782), Tang dynasty poet\n* The royal family of [[Wuyue]], especially:\n** [[Qian Chu]] (\u9322\u4ff6) (929\u2013988), last king\n** [[Qian Liu]] (\u9322\u93d0) (852\u2013932), founder\n* [[Qian Qianyi]] (\u94b1\u8c26\u76ca) (1582\u20131664), Ming dynasty official and author\n* {{ill|Qian Taiji|zh|\u9322\u6cf0\u5409}} (1791\u20131863), Qing dynasty bibliophile, official\n* [[Qian Weiyan]] (\u94b1\u60df\u6f14) (962\u20131034), Song Chancellor, Duke\n* {{ill|Qian Yiji|zh|\u9322\u5100\u5409}} (1783\u20131850), Qing dynasty official, geographer\n* {{ill|Qian Yingpu|zh|\u9322\u61c9\u6ea5}} (1824\u20131902), Qing dynasty official, Grand Councillor\n\n===Modern===\n* [[Ch'ien Mu]] (\u9322\u7a46) (1895\u20131990), historian\n* [[Qian Baojun]] (\u94b1\u5b9d\u94a7) (1907\u20131996), polymer chemist and educator, co-founder of [[Donghua University]]<ref>[http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10255-2010060606.htm \u94b1\u5b9d\u94a7\u4e0e\u4e2d\u56fd\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7ea4\u4e1a]</ref>\n* [[Chin Kar-lok]] (\u9322\u5609\u6a02) (born 1965), actor and action choreographer\n* [[Frederick Chien]] (\u9322\u5fa9) (born 1935), Republic of China politician, diplomat\n* {{ill|Qian Changzhao|zh|\u9322\u660c\u7167}} (1899\u20131988), industrialist and politician\n* [[Qian Liren]] (\u9322\u674e\u4ec1) (born 1924), People's Republic of China politician, diplomat\n* [[Qian Nairong]] (born 1945), linguist\n* [[Nancy Qian|Qian Nancy]] (\u94b1\u6960\u7b60) (born 1978), economist, Northwestern University Professor\n* [[Qian Qichen]] (\u94b1\u5176\u741b) (1928\u20132017), Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China\n* [[Qian Sanqiang]] (\u94b1\u4e09\u5f3a) (1913\u20131992), nuclear physicist\n* [[Chien Shih-Liang]] (\u9322\u601d\u4eae) (1908\u20131983), chemist and educator\n* [[Qian Weichang]] (\u9322\u5049\u9577) (1913\u20132010), physicist and mathematician\n* {{ill|Qian Wenzhong|zh|\u94b1\u6587\u5fe0}} (born 1966), Tibetologist and Indologist, Fudan University professor\n* [[Qian Xiuling]] (\u9322\u79c0\u73b2; 1912\u20132008), Chinese emigrant to Belgium who helped save hundreds of Belgians from execution by the Nazi\n* [[Qian Xuantong]] (\u9322\u7384\u540c) (1887\u20131939), linguist\n* [[Qian Xuesen]] (Tsien Hsue-shen) (\u9322\u5b78\u68ee) (1911\u20132009), rocket scientist and physicist\n* {{ill|Qian Ying|zh|\u94b1\u745b}} (1903\u20131973), People's Republic of China politician\n* [[Qian Yunlu]] (\u94b1\u8fd0\u5f55) (born 1944), People's Republic of China politician\n* [[Qian Zhengying]] (\u94b1\u6b63\u82f1) (born 1923), hydrologist, People's Republic of China politician\n* {{ill|Qian Zhiguang|zh|\u94b1\u4e4b\u5149}} (1900\u20131994), Minister of Light Industry and Minister of Textile Industry\n* [[Qian Zhijun]] (\u94b1\u5fd7\u541b) (born 1987), actor and subject of the \"Little Fatty\" internet meme\n* {{ill|Qian Zhimin|zh|\u94b1\u667a\u6c11}} (born 1960), former President of [[China National Nuclear Corporation]]\n* [[Qian Zhongshu]] (\u9322\u937e\u66f8) (1910\u20131998), scholar and writer\n* [[Qian Zhuangfei]] (1895\u20131935), Chinese intelligence agent\n* [[Robert Tienwen Chien]] (\u9322\u5929\u554f) (1931-1983), American Computer Scientist, University of Illinois Professor, Director of Coordinated Science Laboratory\n* [[Ronny Chieng]] (\u9322\u4fe1\u4f0a), Malaysian Chinese standup comedian and actor\n* [[Roger Y.

The Jumo 204 first entered service in 1932. Later engines in the series were designated '''Jumo 205''', '''Jumo 206''', '''Jumo 207''' and '''Jumo 208''', they differed in stroke and bore and supercharging arrangements.\n\n==Design and development==\nDevelopment of the Junkers diesel engines started in the 1920s with the '''Junkers Fo3''' and '''Junkers Fo4'''/'''Junkers SL1'''. The Fo4 was re-designated '''Junkers 4''', which in turn was re-designated Junkers Jumo 204 by the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]] (RLM), where the first number indicates the manufacturer; 2 \u2013 Junkers Motoren.<ref name=kay>{{cite book |title= Junkers Aircraft & Engines 1913\u20131945|last=Kay|first=Antony| year=2004|publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books |location=London |isbn=0-85177-985-9}}</ref>\n\nThese engines all used a [[two-stroke cycle]] with six cylinders and twelve pistons, in an [[opposed piston]] configuration with two crankshafts, one at the bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust ports were duplicated at both ends of the block. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, totaling four nozzles per cylinder.\n\nAs is typical of two-stroke designs, the Jumos used fixed intake and exhaust ports instead of valves, which were uncovered when the pistons reached a certain point in their stroke. Normally such designs have poor [[volumetric efficiency]] because both ports open and close at the same time and are generally located across from each other in the cylinder. This leads to poor scavenging of the burnt charge, which is why valve-less two-strokes generally run smoky and are inefficient.\n\nThe Jumo 204 solved this problem to a very large degree through a better arrangement of the ports. The intake port was located under the \"lower\" piston, while the exhaust port was under the \"upper\". The lower crankshaft ran eleven degrees behind the upper, meaning that the exhaust ports opened first, allowing proper scavenging. This system made the two-stroke Jumos run as cleanly as four-stroke engines using valves, but with considerably less complexity.\n\nThe Jumo 204 (originally designated '''Jumo 4''') was test flown in early 1929 installed in a [[Junkers G 24]].\n\nThe Jumo Fo3 and 204 were licensed to [[Napier & Son]], who built a small number as the [[Napier Culverin]] just prior to the war. Late in the war, they mounted three Culverins in a triangle layout to produce the [[Napier Deltic]], which was for some time one of the most powerful and compact diesel engines in the world.\n\n==Variants==\n''Data from Junkers Aircraft & Engines 1913\u20131945.''<ref name=kay/>\n;Mo3:A research diesel engine for test bed use only, the Mo3 was a four-cylinder, (eight piston), opposed-piston engine designed to run horizontally. Tested from 1913, the problems found in testing the Mo3 were progressively solved after World War I with the Fo3 and later opposed piston diesels.\n;Fo3:From 1924, Junkers experimented with the Fo3, A vertical 5-cyl. opposed-piston diesel, which ran on a test bed in the summer of 1926, developing {{convert|830|hp|kW|abbr=on|disp=flip}} at 1,200 rpm. Mostly successful, the Fo3 did highlight the need for accurate dynamic balancing of the rotating components.\n;Fo4: (a.k.a. SL1) The Fo4, benefiting from the experience gained with the Fo3, was a six-cylinder opposed-piston diesel engine, tested from 1928 and flown in the nose of a [[Junkers G.24]] from 30 August 1929.\n;Jumo 4: After the successful bench runs and flight tests, the Fo4 was refined into the certificated Jumo 4, enjoying limited success powering re-engined [[Junkers F24kay]] airliners of [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], remaining in service until 1939.\n;Jumo 204:Later production of refined Jumo 4s: Jumo 204A, 204B, and 204C, differing in airscrew drive arrangements.\n;[[Napier Culverin]]:The Jumo 204 and 205 were licensed to [[D.

The Jumo 204 first entered service in 1932. Later engines in the series were designated '''Jumo 205''', '''Jumo 206''', '''Jumo 207''' and '''Jumo 208''', they differed in stroke and bore and supercharging arrangements.\n\n==Design and development==\nDevelopment of the Junkers diesel engines started in the 1920s with the '''Junkers Fo3''' and '''Junkers Fo4'''/'''Junkers SL1'''. The Fo4 was re-designated '''Junkers 4''', which in turn was re-designated Junkers Jumo 204 by the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]] (RLM), where the first number indicates the manufacturer; 2 \u2013 Junkers Motoren.<ref name=kay>{{cite book |title= Junkers Aircraft & Engines 1913\u20131945|last=Kay|first=Antony| year=2004|publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books |location=London |isbn=0-85177-985-9}}</ref>\n\nThese engines all used a [[two-stroke cycle]] with six cylinders and twelve pistons, in an [[opposed piston]] configuration with two crankshafts, one at the bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust ports were duplicated at both ends of the block. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, totaling four nozzles per cylinder.\n\nAs is typical of two-stroke designs, the Jumos used fixed intake and exhaust ports instead of valves, which were uncovered when the pistons reached a certain point in their stroke. Normally such designs have poor [[volumetric efficiency]] because both ports open and close at the same time and are generally located across from each other in the cylinder. This leads to poor scavenging of the burnt charge, which is why valve-less two-strokes generally run smoky and are inefficient.\n\nThe Jumo 204 solved this problem to a very large degree through a better arrangement of the ports. The intake port was located under the \"lower\" piston, while the exhaust port was under the \"upper\". The lower crankshaft ran eleven degrees behind the upper, meaning that the exhaust ports opened first, allowing proper scavenging. This system made the two-stroke Jumos run as cleanly as four-stroke engines using valves, but with considerably less complexity.\n\nThe Jumo 204 (originally designated '''Jumo 4''') was test flown in early 1929 installed in a [[Junkers G 24]].\n\nThe Jumo Fo3 and 204 were licensed to [[Napier & Son]], who built a small number as the [[Napier Culverin]] just prior to the war. Late in the war, they mounted three Culverins in a triangle layout to produce the [[Napier Deltic]], which was for some time one of the most powerful and compact diesel engines in the world.\n\n==Variants==\n''Data from Junkers Aircraft & Engines 1913\u20131945.''<ref name=kay/>\n;Mo3:A research diesel engine for test bed use only, the Mo3 was a four-cylinder, (eight piston), opposed-piston engine designed to run horizontally. Tested from 1913, the problems found in testing the Mo3 were progressively solved after World War I with the Fo3 and later opposed piston diesels.\n;Fo3:From 1924, Junkers experimented with the Fo3, A vertical 5-cyl. opposed-piston diesel, which ran on a test bed in the summer of 1926, developing {{convert|830|hp|kW|abbr=on|disp=flip}} at 1,200 rpm. Mostly successful, the Fo3 did highlight the need for accurate dynamic balancing of the rotating components.\n;Fo4: (a.k.a. SL1) The Fo4, benefiting from the experience gained with the Fo3, was a six-cylinder opposed-piston diesel engine, tested from 1928 and flown in the nose of a [[Junkers G.24]] from 30 August 1929.\n;Jumo 4: After the successful bench runs and flight tests, the Fo4 was refined into the certificated Jumo 4, enjoying limited success powering re-engined [[Junkers F24kay]] airliners of [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], remaining in service until 1939.\n;Jumo 204:Later production of refined Jumo 4s: Jumo 204A, 204B, and 204C, differing in airscrew drive arrangements.\n;[[Napier Culverin]]:The Jumo 204 and 205 were licensed to [[D.

Formation in place would require an unusually dense disk and would not readily account for the orbital resonances. Formation outside the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] does not explain the planets' terrestrial nature or Earth-like masses. The authors proposed a new scenario in which planet formation starts at the frost line where pebble-size particles trigger [[streaming instability|streaming instabilities]], then protoplanets quickly mature by [[pebble accretion]]. When the planets reach Earth mass they create perturbations in the gas disk that halt the inward drift of pebbles causing their growth to stall. The planets are transported by [[Planetary migration#Type I migration|Type I migration]] to the inner disk, where they stall at the magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances.<ref name=\"Ormel2017\">{{cite journal |title=Formation of TRAPPIST-1 and other compact systems |arxiv=1703.06924 |class= |first1=Chris |last1=Ormel |first2=Beibei |last2=Liu |first3=Djoeke |last3=Schoonenberg |date=20 March 2017 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201730826 |volume=604 |issue=1 |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |page=A1 |bibcode=2017A&A...604A...1O}}</ref> This scenario predicts the planets formed with significant fractions of water, around 10%, with the largest initial fractions of water on the innermost and outermost planets.<ref name=\"Schoonedberg_etal_2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Schoonenberg |first1=Djoeke |last2=Liu |first2=Beibei |last3=Ormel |first3=Chris W. |last4=Dorn |first4=Caroline |title=A pebble-driven formation model for compact planetary systems like TRAPPIST-1 |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=A149 |pages=627 |arxiv=1906.00669|year=2019 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201935607 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tidal locking ===\nIt is suggested that all seven planets are likely to be [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] into a so-called synchronous spin state (one side of each planet permanently facing the star),<ref name=\"Gillon2017\" /> making the [[Habitability of red dwarf systems|development of life there]] much more challenging.<ref name=\"Witze2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Witze |first1=A. |title=These seven alien worlds could help explain how planets form |journal=Nature |date=22 February 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21512}}</ref> A less likely possibility is that some may be trapped in a higher-order [[spin\u2013orbit resonance]].<ref name=\"Gillon2017\"/> Tidally locked planets would typically have very large temperature differences between their permanently lit day sides and their permanently dark night sides, which could produce very strong winds circling the planets.

Their results suggest that the two planets may have lost as much as 15 Earth oceans of water (although the actual loss would probably be lower), depending on their initial water contents. Nonetheless, they may have retained enough water to remain habitable, and a planet orbiting further out was predicted to lose much less water.<ref name=\"Bolmont2017\"/>\n\nHowever, a subsequent ''[[XMM-Newton]]'' X-ray study by Wheatley et al. found that the star emits X-rays at a level comparable to our own much larger Sun, and extreme ultraviolet radiation at a level 50-fold stronger than assumed by Bolmont et al.

The publication noted that these levels \"neglected the radiation physics and hydrodynamics of the planetary atmosphere\" and could be a significant overestimate. Indeed, the XUV stripping of a very thick hydrogen and helium primary atmosphere might actually be required for habitability. The high levels of XUV would also be expected to make water retention on planet ''d'' less likely than predicted by Bolmont et al., though even on highly irradiated planets it might remain in [[cold trap]]s at the poles or on the night sides of tidally locked planets.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Strong XUV irradiation of the Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters |last=Wheatley |first=Peter J. |last2=Louden |first2=Tom |last3=Bourrier |first3=Vincent |last4=Ehrenreich |first4=David |last5=Gillon |first5=Micha\u00ebl |volume=465 |issue=1 |pages=L74\u2013L78 |date=February 2017 |doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slw192 |bibcode=2017MNRAS.465L..74W |arxiv=1605.01564}}</ref>\n\nIf a dense atmosphere like Earth's, with a protective ozone layer, exists on planets in the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1, UV surface environments would be similar to present-day Earth.

Beside the direct harm caused by the radiation associated with the eruptions, they can also pose further threats: the chemical composition of the planetary atmospheres is probably altered by the eruptions on a regular basis, and the atmospheres can be also eroded in the long term.

This is based on a comparison of the [[Hill sphere]], which marks the outer limit of a moon's possible orbit by defining the region of space in which a planet's gravity is stronger than the tidal force of its star, and the [[Roche limit]], which represents the smallest distance at which a moon can orbit before the planet's tides exceed its own gravity and pull it apart.  These constraints do not rule out the presence of ring systems (where particles are held together by chemical rather than gravitational forces).  The mathematical derivation is as follows:\n\n<math>R_H = a_p \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{M_p}{3M_s}} </math>\n\n<math>R_H</math> is the Hill radius of the planet, calculated from the planetary [[semi-major axis]] <math>a_p</math>, the mass of the planet <math>M_p</math>, and the mass of the star <math>M_s</math>. Note that the mass of the TRAPPIST-1 star is approximately {{Earth mass|30,000|link=y}} (see data table above);<!--- Note: the data we have up in the infobox supports a value of 26700 Earth masses, but calculating back from the figures in the table suggests 26000 was used in the reference ---> the remaining figures are provided in the table below.\n\n<math>R_R \\approx 2.44 R_p \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m}}</math>\n\n<math>R_R</math> is the Roche limit of the planet, calculated from the radius of the planet <math>R_p</math>, and the density of the planet <math>\\rho_p</math>.<!--- (I haven't sorted this out and don't want to OR confusion...  presumably this should be <math>\\frac{M_p}{4/3 \\pi R_p^3}</math>.  If Earth masses and radii are used, this will be found as a multiple of [[Earth]]'s density of 5.514 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and the density of the moon <math>\\rho_m</math>.  Note that one [[astronomical unit]] (149597870700 meters), used as the unit of comparison in the table below, is 23454.79 Earth radii (6378137 meters). --->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\"\n!Planet\n!<math>M_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth masses)</small>\n!<math>R_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth radii)</small>\n!<math>\\rho_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth density)</small>\n!<math>a_p</math> <br /> <small>([[astronomical unit|AU]])</small>\n!<math>R_H</math> <br /> <small>(milliAU)</small>\n!<math>R_R</math> <br /> <small>(milliAU)</small>\n!<math>R_H/R_R</math>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1b]]\n|1.017\n|1.121\n|0.726\n|0.0116\n|0.261\n|0.127\n|2.055\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1c]]\n|1.156\n|1.095\n|0.883\n|0.0158\n|0.372\n|0.133\n|2.797\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1d]]\n|0.297\n|0.784\n|0.616\n|0.0223\n|0.334\n|0.084\n|3.976\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1e]]\n|0.772\n|0.910\n|1.024\n|0.0293\n|0.603\n|0.116\n|5.198\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1f]]\n|0.934\n|1.046\n|0.816\n|0.0385\n|0.845\n|0.124\n|6.815\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1g]]\n|1.148\n|1.148\n|0.759\n|0.0469\n|1.101\n|0.132\n|8.341\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1h]]\n|0.331\n|0.773\n|0.719\n|0.0619\n|0.961\n|0.087\n|11.046\n|}\n\nKane notes that moons near the edge of the Hill radius may be subject to resonant removal during planetary migration, leading to a Hill reduction factor roughly estimated as 1/3 for typical systems and 1/4 for the TRAPPIST-1 system; thus moons are not expected for the planets where <math>R_H/R_R</math> is less than four.  Furthermore, tidal interactions with the planet can result in a transfer of energy from the planet's rotation to the moon's orbit, causing a moon to leave the stable region over time.  For these reasons, even the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets are believed to be unlikely to have moons.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:PIA22093-TRAPPIST-1-PlanetLineup-20180205.jpg|Artist's concept of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system.\nFile:PIA21428-TRAPPIST-1-Comparison-SolarSystem&JovianMoons-20180205.jpg|The TRAPPIST-1 system compared to the [[Solar System]]; all seven planets of TRAPPIST-1 could fit inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]<ref name=\"NBC-20170222\" />\n</gallery>\n\n=== Videos ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:PIA21427 - TRAPPIST-1 Planetary Orbits and Transits.ogg|[[:File:PIA21427 - TRAPPIST-1 Planetary Orbits and Transits.ogg|Video (01:32)]] \u2013  Artistic representation of TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets transiting their host star.\nFile:PIA21468 - TRAPPIST-1 Planets - Flyaround Animation.ogg|[[:File:PIA21468 - TRAPPIST-1 Planets - Flyaround Animation.ogg|Video (01:10)]] \u2013  Fly-around animation of the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[HD 10180]], a star with at least seven known planets\n* [[Kepler-90]], a star with eight known planets\n* [[KIC 8462852]], another star with notable transit data\n* [[LHS 1140]], another star with a planetary system suitable for atmospheric studies\n* [[Active SETI]], the attempt to transmit messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life\n* [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]\n* [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]]\n* [[Nikole Lewis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note|refs=\n<ref group=\"note\" name=\"luminosity_visual\">Taking the absolute visual magnitude of TRAPPIST-1 <math>M_{V_\\ast} = 18.4</math> and the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun <math>M_{V_\\odot} = 4.83</math>, the visual luminosity can be calculated by <math>\\tfrac{L_{V_\\ast}}{L_{V_\\odot}} = 10^{0.4(M_{V_\\odot} - M_{V_\\ast})}.</math></ref>\n\n<ref group=\"note\" name=\"universalgravity\">The surface gravity is calculated directly from [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which gives the formula <math>g = \\tfrac{GM}{r^2}</math>, where ''M'' is the mass of the object, ''r'' is its radius, and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

The relative orbital periods (proceeding outward) approximate whole integer ratios of 24/24, 24/15, 24/9, 24/6, 24/4, 24/3, and 24/2, respectively, or nearest-neighbor period ratios of about 8/5, 5/3, 3/2, 3/2, 4/3, and 3/2 (1.603, 1.672, 1.506, 1.509, 1.342, and 1.519). This represents the longest known chain of near-resonant exoplanets, and is thought to have resulted from interactions between the planets as they migrated inward within the residual [[protoplanetary disk]] after forming at greater initial distances.<ref name=\"Gillon2017\" /><ref name=\"Luger_etal_2017\"/>\n\nMost sets of orbits similar to the set found at TRAPPIST-1 are unstable, causing one planet to come within the [[Hill sphere]] of another or to be thrown out. But it has been found that there is a way for a system to migrate into a fairly stable state through damping interactions with, for example, a [[protoplanetary disk]]. After this, tidal forces can give the system a long-term stability.<ref name=\"ApJL-20170510\" />\n\nThe tight correspondence between whole number ratios in orbital resonances and in music theory has made it possible to convert the system's motion into music.<ref name=\"NYT-20170510\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Russo|first=Matt|title=What does the universe sound like?

Formation in place would require an unusually dense disk and would not readily account for the orbital resonances. Formation outside the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] does not explain the planets' terrestrial nature or Earth-like masses. The authors proposed a new scenario in which planet formation starts at the frost line where pebble-size particles trigger [[streaming instability|streaming instabilities]], then protoplanets quickly mature by [[pebble accretion]]. When the planets reach Earth mass they create perturbations in the gas disk that halt the inward drift of pebbles causing their growth to stall. The planets are transported by [[Planetary migration#Type I migration|Type I migration]] to the inner disk, where they stall at the magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances.<ref name=\"Ormel2017\">{{cite journal |title=Formation of TRAPPIST-1 and other compact systems |arxiv=1703.06924 |class= |first1=Chris |last1=Ormel |first2=Beibei |last2=Liu |first3=Djoeke |last3=Schoonenberg |date=20 March 2017 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201730826 |volume=604 |issue=1 |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |page=A1 |bibcode=2017A&A...604A...1O}}</ref> This scenario predicts the planets formed with significant fractions of water, around 10%, with the largest initial fractions of water on the innermost and outermost planets.<ref name=\"Schoonedberg_etal_2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Schoonenberg |first1=Djoeke |last2=Liu |first2=Beibei |last3=Ormel |first3=Chris W. |last4=Dorn |first4=Caroline |title=A pebble-driven formation model for compact planetary systems like TRAPPIST-1 |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=A149 |pages=627 |arxiv=1906.00669|year=2019 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201935607 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tidal locking ===\nIt is suggested that all seven planets are likely to be [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] into a so-called synchronous spin state (one side of each planet permanently facing the star),<ref name=\"Gillon2017\" /> making the [[Habitability of red dwarf systems|development of life there]] much more challenging.<ref name=\"Witze2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Witze |first1=A. |title=These seven alien worlds could help explain how planets form |journal=Nature |date=22 February 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21512}}</ref> A less likely possibility is that some may be trapped in a higher-order [[spin\u2013orbit resonance]].<ref name=\"Gillon2017\"/> Tidally locked planets would typically have very large temperature differences between their permanently lit day sides and their permanently dark night sides, which could produce very strong winds circling the planets.

Their results suggest that the two planets may have lost as much as 15 Earth oceans of water (although the actual loss would probably be lower), depending on their initial water contents. Nonetheless, they may have retained enough water to remain habitable, and a planet orbiting further out was predicted to lose much less water.<ref name=\"Bolmont2017\"/>\n\nHowever, a subsequent ''[[XMM-Newton]]'' X-ray study by Wheatley et al. found that the star emits X-rays at a level comparable to our own much larger Sun, and extreme ultraviolet radiation at a level 50-fold stronger than assumed by Bolmont et al. The authors predicted this would significantly alter the [[Primary atmosphere|primary]] and perhaps [[Secondary atmosphere|secondary]] atmospheres of close-in, Earth-sized planets spanning the habitable zone of the star. The publication noted that these levels \"neglected the radiation physics and hydrodynamics of the planetary atmosphere\" and could be a significant overestimate. Indeed, the XUV stripping of a very thick hydrogen and helium primary atmosphere might actually be required for habitability. The high levels of XUV would also be expected to make water retention on planet ''d'' less likely than predicted by Bolmont et al., though even on highly irradiated planets it might remain in [[cold trap]]s at the poles or on the night sides of tidally locked planets.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Strong XUV irradiation of the Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters |last=Wheatley |first=Peter J. |last2=Louden |first2=Tom |last3=Bourrier |first3=Vincent |last4=Ehrenreich |first4=David |last5=Gillon |first5=Micha\u00ebl |volume=465 |issue=1 |pages=L74\u2013L78 |date=February 2017 |doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slw192 |bibcode=2017MNRAS.465L..74W |arxiv=1605.01564}}</ref>\n\nIf a dense atmosphere like Earth's, with a protective ozone layer, exists on planets in the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1, UV surface environments would be similar to present-day Earth.

Beside the direct harm caused by the radiation associated with the eruptions, they can also pose further threats: the chemical composition of the planetary atmospheres is probably altered by the eruptions on a regular basis, and the atmospheres can be also eroded in the long term. A sufficiently strong magnetic field of the exoplanets could protect their atmosphere from the harmful effects of such eruptions, but an Earth-like exoplanet would need a magnetic field in the order of 10\u20131000 [[Gauss (unit)|Gauss]] to be shielded from such flares (as a comparison, the [[Earth's magnetic field]] is \u22480.5&nbsp;Gauss).<ref name=\"Vida_etal_2017\" />\n\n=== Probability of interplanetary panspermia ===\nHypothetically, if the conditions of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system were to be able to support life, any possible life that had developed through [[abiogenesis]] on one of the planets would likely be spread to other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system via [[panspermia]], the transfer of life from one planet to another.<ref name=\"panspermia\">{{cite journal |title=Enhanced interplanetary panspermia in the TRAPPIST-1 system | url=https://www.space.com/37267-trappist-1-exoplanets-alien-life-pansperima.html |first=Mike |last=Wall | date=23 June 2017 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=114 | issue=26 | pages=6689\u20136693 | bibcode=2017PNAS..114.6689L | arxiv=1703.00878 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1703517114 | pmid=28611223 | pmc=5495259 }}</ref> Due to the close proximity of the planets in the habitable zone with a separation of at least ~0.01 AU from each other, the probability of life being transferred from one planet to another is greatly enhanced.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Enhanced interplanetary panspermia in the TRAPPIST-1 system |arxiv=1703.00878 |class= |first1=Manasvi |last1=Lingam |first2=Abraham |last2=Loeb |date=15 March 2017 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1703517114 |pmid=28611223 |pmc=5495259 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=114 |issue=26 |pages=6689\u20136693 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.6689L}}</ref> Compared to the likelihood of panspermia from Earth to Mars, the likelihood of interplanetary panspermia in the TRAPPIST-1 system is thought to be about 10,000 times higher.<ref name=\"panspermia\" />\n\n=== Radio signal searches ===\nIn February 2017, [[Seth Shostak]], senior astronomer for the [[SETI Institute]], noted, \"[T]he SETI Institute used its [[Allen Telescope Array]] {{interp|in 2016|orig=last year}} to observe the environs of TRAPPIST-1, scanning through 10 billion radio channels in search of signals.

Smaller moons of {{convert|200|-|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius would likely not have been detected.\n\nAt a theoretical level, Kane found that moons around the inner TRAPPIST-1 planets would need to be extraordinarily dense to be even theoretically possible.  This is based on a comparison of the [[Hill sphere]], which marks the outer limit of a moon's possible orbit by defining the region of space in which a planet's gravity is stronger than the tidal force of its star, and the [[Roche limit]], which represents the smallest distance at which a moon can orbit before the planet's tides exceed its own gravity and pull it apart.  These constraints do not rule out the presence of ring systems (where particles are held together by chemical rather than gravitational forces).  The mathematical derivation is as follows:\n\n<math>R_H = a_p \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{M_p}{3M_s}} </math>\n\n<math>R_H</math> is the Hill radius of the planet, calculated from the planetary [[semi-major axis]] <math>a_p</math>, the mass of the planet <math>M_p</math>, and the mass of the star <math>M_s</math>. Note that the mass of the TRAPPIST-1 star is approximately {{Earth mass|30,000|link=y}} (see data table above);<!--- Note: the data we have up in the infobox supports a value of 26700 Earth masses, but calculating back from the figures in the table suggests 26000 was used in the reference ---> the remaining figures are provided in the table below.\n\n<math>R_R \\approx 2.44 R_p \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m}}</math>\n\n<math>R_R</math> is the Roche limit of the planet, calculated from the radius of the planet <math>R_p</math>, and the density of the planet <math>\\rho_p</math>.<!--- (I haven't sorted this out and don't want to OR confusion...  presumably this should be <math>\\frac{M_p}{4/3 \\pi R_p^3}</math>.  If Earth masses and radii are used, this will be found as a multiple of [[Earth]]'s density of 5.514 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and the density of the moon <math>\\rho_m</math>.  Note that one [[astronomical unit]] (149597870700 meters), used as the unit of comparison in the table below, is 23454.79 Earth radii (6378137 meters). --->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\"\n!Planet\n!<math>M_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth masses)</small>\n!<math>R_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth radii)</small>\n!<math>\\rho_p</math> <br /> <small>(Earth density)</small>\n!<math>a_p</math> <br /> <small>([[astronomical unit|AU]])</small>\n!<math>R_H</math> <br /> <small>(milliAU)</small>\n!<math>R_R</math> <br /> <small>(milliAU)</small>\n!<math>R_H/R_R</math>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1b]]\n|1.017\n|1.121\n|0.726\n|0.0116\n|0.261\n|0.127\n|2.055\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1c]]\n|1.156\n|1.095\n|0.883\n|0.0158\n|0.372\n|0.133\n|2.797\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1d]]\n|0.297\n|0.784\n|0.616\n|0.0223\n|0.334\n|0.084\n|3.976\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1e]]\n|0.772\n|0.910\n|1.024\n|0.0293\n|0.603\n|0.116\n|5.198\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1f]]\n|0.934\n|1.046\n|0.816\n|0.0385\n|0.845\n|0.124\n|6.815\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1g]]\n|1.148\n|1.148\n|0.759\n|0.0469\n|1.101\n|0.132\n|8.341\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[TRAPPIST-1h]]\n|0.331\n|0.773\n|0.719\n|0.0619\n|0.961\n|0.087\n|11.046\n|}\n\nKane notes that moons near the edge of the Hill radius may be subject to resonant removal during planetary migration, leading to a Hill reduction factor roughly estimated as 1/3 for typical systems and 1/4 for the TRAPPIST-1 system; thus moons are not expected for the planets where <math>R_H/R_R</math> is less than four.  Furthermore, tidal interactions with the planet can result in a transfer of energy from the planet's rotation to the moon's orbit, causing a moon to leave the stable region over time.  For these reasons, even the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets are believed to be unlikely to have moons.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:PIA22093-TRAPPIST-1-PlanetLineup-20180205.jpg|Artist's concept of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system.\nFile:PIA21428-TRAPPIST-1-Comparison-SolarSystem&JovianMoons-20180205.jpg|The TRAPPIST-1 system compared to the [[Solar System]]; all seven planets of TRAPPIST-1 could fit inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]<ref name=\"NBC-20170222\" />\n</gallery>\n\n=== Videos ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:PIA21427 - TRAPPIST-1 Planetary Orbits and Transits.ogg|[[:File:PIA21427 - TRAPPIST-1 Planetary Orbits and Transits.ogg|Video (01:32)]] \u2013  Artistic representation of TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets transiting their host star.\nFile:PIA21468 - TRAPPIST-1 Planets - Flyaround Animation.ogg|[[:File:PIA21468 - TRAPPIST-1 Planets - Flyaround Animation.ogg|Video (01:10)]] \u2013  Fly-around animation of the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[HD 10180]], a star with at least seven known planets\n* [[Kepler-90]], a star with eight known planets\n* [[KIC 8462852]], another star with notable transit data\n* [[LHS 1140]], another star with a planetary system suitable for atmospheric studies\n* [[Active SETI]], the attempt to transmit messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life\n* [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]\n* [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]]\n* [[Nikole Lewis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note|refs=\n<ref group=\"note\" name=\"luminosity_visual\">Taking the absolute visual magnitude of TRAPPIST-1 <math>M_{V_\\ast} = 18.4</math> and the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun <math>M_{V_\\odot} = 4.83</math>, the visual luminosity can be calculated by <math>\\tfrac{L_{V_\\ast}}{L_{V_\\odot}} = 10^{0.4(M_{V_\\odot} - M_{V_\\ast})}.</math></ref>\n\n<ref group=\"note\" name=\"universalgravity\">The surface gravity is calculated directly from [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which gives the formula <math>g = \\tfrac{GM}{r^2}</math>, where ''M'' is the mass of the object, ''r'' is its radius, and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].
