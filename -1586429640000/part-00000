It is a [[remake]] of [[Luc Besson]]'s 1990 film ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]''.\n\nMaggie Hayward ([[Bridget Fonda]]) is a violent and unstable drug [[Substance dependence|addict]] found guilty of murdering a police officer, and is [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]]. Her death is faked, and a secret government agent named Bob ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) informs her that she is to become an [[espionage|assassin]]. She is given a makeover and training that transform her into a beautiful woman, and she is also trained as a killer. Her career as an assassin goes well at first. Then, after a mission goes awry, the agency sends in Victor ([[Harvey Keitel]]), a \"cleaner,\" to kill everyone and destroy the bodies.\n\n==Plot==\nMaggie Hayward ([[Bridget Fonda]]) is a [[drug addict]] found guilty of [[murdering]] a police officer during a robbery shootout, and is about to be [[sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]]. Her demise is faked and a spy named Bob ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) informs her that she has to work for him. Maggie, having little choice, reluctantly agrees to cooperate and begins a regimen of intensive training that includes not only [[martial arts]] and firearms training, but [[etiquette]] and computer use.\n\nSenior Operative Amanda ([[Anne Bancroft]]) transforms her into a refined, beautiful woman. She is taken on a dinner date with Bob, who informs her about the first job: an assassination of a VIP eating at the same restaurant. Maggie kills the VIP and his bodyguard and then is pursued by a team of the VIP's bodyguards. She shoots several of the bodyguards and then escapes from the kitchen by jumping down a laundry chute. This task was her final test and she has now completed her training.\n\nThe following morning she leaves for [[Venice, California]], where she enters into a romantic relationship with apartment house manager J.P. ([[Dermot Mulroney]]). While her first assignments, both hit jobs, are ultimately successful, Maggie quickly comes to hate her work and tries to quit her job as a professional killer. As things progress between her and J.P. and her double life threatens their relationship, she asks for help in leaving the agency. Her request is denied, but Bob agrees to get her out of the agency if she completes the next task.\n\nThe new job is to masquerade as Angela ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), the girlfriend of Fahd Bakhtiar ([[Richard Romanus]]), an Iranian trading in [[nuclear weapons]]. As she prepares for the job, J.P. continues to complain about her mysterious friends and mocks the improvised backstory that Bob had provided for himself and Maggie. Maggie is shown watching a scene from ''[[Deception_(1946_film)|Deception]]'', in which a woman kills a former lover to keep their past secret from her new husband, reflecting Maggie's determination to kill her employers if necessary to protect her relationship with J.P.\n\nTaking out Angela proves problematic and results in the deaths of Angela's two bodyguards and the injury of Maggie's partner, Beth ([[Lorraine Toussaint]]). Director Kaufman ([[Miguel Ferrer]]) then sends in Victor, a \"cleaner\" ([[Harvey Keitel]]) to get rid of the bodies and salvage the mission. Unknown to Maggie, he has also been ordered to kill both agents as well because one failure results in death. After killing the wounded Beth in front of Maggie, he drives her to Fahd's home. At gunpoint she gets Fahd to unlock his computer and reveal his secrets, but he avoids execution and she is forced to flee.\n\nAs they purportedly drive back to her residence, Maggie sees a gun in Victor's waistband and correctly suspects that he is going to kill her. This leads to a struggle and the car spins out of control. Ultimately, Victor is dragged over a ravine and killed. Maggie makes her way back to her apartment, but leaves sometime during the night. Bob subsequently learns of her disappearance from J.P.. As Bob is leaving, he sees Maggie watching him through the mist. Instead of reporting her, he calls Kaufman and informs him, after some hesitation, that the cleaner and Maggie are both dead.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Maggie Hayward/Claudia Anne Doran/Nina\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Bob\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as J.P.\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Amanda\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Victor\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Kaufman\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as Angela\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Fahd Bakhtiar\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Drugstore owner\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Big Stan\n* [[John Badham]] as Room service waiter\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as Beth\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed approximately $30,038,362 in the US and received mixed reviews.

Talk of reviving the titles began circulating in 2012, when a WWE.com article was posted in favor of resurrecting the titles. Female performers were also in favor of adding a women's tag team championship, but it was not until 2018 when the titles became a reality. Online speculation began when WWE announced their first all female event [[WWE Evolution|Evolution]] for October, but the titles did not appear or were announced. However, on the December 24 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] officially announced that a new [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] would debut in 2019 (and would not carry the lineage of the original title). [[The Boss 'n' Hug Connection]] ([[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] and [[Sasha Banks]]) became the inaugural champions at [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|Elimination Chamber]] in February.

Among these mainstream organizations in the United States are the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], [[Child Welfare League of America]], the [[American Bar Association]], the North American Council on Adoptable Children, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]].<ref name=hrc>{{cite web|title=Professional Organizations on GLBT Parenting|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/parenting/professional-opinion.asp}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in [[Pediatrics]]: <blockquote>On the basis of this comprehensive review of the literature regarding the development and adjustment of children whose parents are the same gender, as well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is in the best interests of children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard to their parents\u2019 gender or sexual orientation.<ref name=pediatric>{{Cite journal | last1 = Perrin | first1 = Ellen C. | last2 = Siegel | first2 = Benjamin S. | last3 = and the COMMITTEE ON PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF CHILD AND FAMILY HEALTH | journal = Pediatrics |\ntitle = Promoting the Well-Being of Children Whose Parents Are Gay or Lesbian | volume = 131 | number = 4 | pages = e1374\u2013e1383 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2013-0377 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/e1374.abstract | pmid=23519940}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2006, the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] stated in an [[amicus brief]] presented to the Supreme Court of the State of California: <blockquote>Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by heterosexual parents, those assertions find no support in the scientific research literature.  When comparing the outcomes of different forms of parenting, it is critically important to make appropriate comparisons. For example, differences resulting from the number of parents in a household cannot be attributed to the parents\u2019 gender or sexual orientation. Research in households with heterosexual parents generally indicates that \u2013 all else being equal \u2013 children do better with two parenting figures rather than just one. The specific research studies typically cited in this regard do not address parents\u2019 sexual orientation, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the consequences of having heterosexual versus nonheterosexual parents, or two parents who are of the same versus different genders. Indeed, the scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are every bit as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. Amici emphasize that the abilities of gay and lesbian persons as parents and the positive outcomes for their children are not areas where credible scientific researchers disagree. Statements by the leading associations of experts in this area reflect professional consensus that children raised by lesbian or gay parents do not differ in any important respects from those raised by heterosexual parents. No credible empirical research suggests otherwise. Allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will not have any detrimental effect on children raised in heterosexual households, but it will benefit children being raised by same-sex couples.<ref name=amici>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf|title=Site Has Moved|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPeer-reviewed studies indicate that no research supports the widely held conviction that the gender of parents matters for child well-being.<ref name=stacey2010>{{cite journal|title=How Does the Gender of Parents Matter?| doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2009.00678.x|volume=72|issue=1|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|pages=3\u201322|year = 2010|last1 = Biblarz|first1 = Timothy J.| last2=Stacey| first2=Judith| citeseerx=10.1.1.593.4963}}</ref> The methodologies used in the major studies of same-sex parenting meet the standards for research in the field of developmental psychology and psychology generally and are considered reliable by members of the respective professions.<ref name=lamb>Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit - United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5n2qV1QIk?url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf |date=2010-01-25 }}</ref> A roundup of related research on Journalist's Resource, a project of the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard]]'s [[John F.

Our position is based on a review representing approximately 50 empirical studies and at least another 50 articles and book chapters and does not rest on the results of any one study.<ref name=cpa2005>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/advocacy/brief.pdf|title=Canadian Psychological Association|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> A review of the psychological research into the well-being of children raised by same-sex and opposite-sex parents continues to indicate that there are no reliable differences in their mental health or social adjustment and that lesbian mothers and gay fathers are not less fit as parents than are their heterosexual counterparts. The opposition to marriage of same-sex couples, on the grounds that it fails to consider the needs\nor rights of children, does not consider the most relevant body of psychological research into this\ntopic or draws inaccurate conclusions from it. Further, opposition to marriage of same-sex couples\noften incorrectly pre-supposes that, by preventing marriage of same-sex couples, no children will\nbe born or raised within families where parents are of the same sex. Such as argument ignores\nthe reality that children are, and will continue to be, born to and raised by parents who are married, those who are unmarried, those who are cohabitating, and those who are single \u2013 most of whom\nwill be heterosexual, some of whom will be gay, and some of whom will be lesbian. Further, the\nliterature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to\nrely) indicates that parents\u2019 financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by\nmarriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized\nunion. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their\nchildren are more likely the result of the way in which society treats them than because of any\ndeficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values.<ref name=\"cpa2006\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn 2007, the [[Australian Psychological Society]] stated: \"The family studies literature indicates that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children\u2019s wellbeing and \u2018outcomes\u2019, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. The research indicates that parenting practices and children's outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favourable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families. The main reason given (by lawmakers) for not allowing people to marry the person of their choice if that person is of the same gender has been the inaccurate assertion that this is in the best interest of children, and that children \u2018need\u2019 or \u2018do better\u2019 in a family with one parent of each gender. As the reviews, statements, and recommendations written by many expert and professional bodies indicate, this assertion is not supported by the family studies research, and in fact, the promotion of this notion, and the laws and public policies that embody it, are clearly counter to the well-being of children.\"<ref name=apsp/>\n\nMany states and territories with the exception of Northern and Western Australia have laws that allow couples to register their domestic relationships, which is called de facto relationship. There is a concern regarding the rights accorded to family members in this type of relationship.  The reason for this is that there is currently no Australian law covering the rights of these families except for a few domestic partner employment benefits.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Equality for Same-Sex Couples: The Legal Recognition of Gay Partnerships in Europe and the United States|last=Merin|first=Yuval|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0226520315|location=Chicago|pages=170}}</ref> Families also do not have access to a set of benefits and mechanisms provided to married couples.

Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do.

When comparing the outcomes of different forms of parenting, it is critically important to make appropriate comparisons. For example, differences resulting from the number of parents in a household cannot be attributed to the parents\u2019 gender or sexual orientation. Research in households with heterosexual parents generally indicates that \u2013 all else being equal \u2013 children do better with two parenting figures rather than just one. The specific research studies typically cited in this regard do not address parents\u2019 sexual orientation, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the consequences of having heterosexual versus nonheterosexual parents, or two parents who are of the same versus different genders. Indeed, the scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are every bit as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. Amici emphasize that the abilities of gay and lesbian persons as parents and the positive outcomes for their children are not areas where credible scientific researchers disagree. Statements by the leading associations of experts in this area reflect professional consensus that children raised by lesbian or gay parents do not differ in any important respects from those raised by heterosexual parents. No credible empirical research suggests otherwise. Allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will not have any detrimental effect on children raised in heterosexual households, but it will benefit children being raised by same-sex couples.<ref name=amici>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf|title=Site Has Moved|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPeer-reviewed studies indicate that no research supports the widely held conviction that the gender of parents matters for child well-being.<ref name=stacey2010>{{cite journal|title=How Does the Gender of Parents Matter?| doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2009.00678.x|volume=72|issue=1|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|pages=3\u201322|year = 2010|last1 = Biblarz|first1 = Timothy J.| last2=Stacey| first2=Judith| citeseerx=10.1.1.593.4963}}</ref> The methodologies used in the major studies of same-sex parenting meet the standards for research in the field of developmental psychology and psychology generally and are considered reliable by members of the respective professions.<ref name=lamb>Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit - United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5n2qV1QIk?url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf |date=2010-01-25 }}</ref> A roundup of related research on Journalist's Resource, a project of the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard]]'s [[John F.

The opposition to marriage of same-sex couples, on the grounds that it fails to consider the needs\nor rights of children, does not consider the most relevant body of psychological research into this\ntopic or draws inaccurate conclusions from it. Further, opposition to marriage of same-sex couples\noften incorrectly pre-supposes that, by preventing marriage of same-sex couples, no children will\nbe born or raised within families where parents are of the same sex. Such as argument ignores\nthe reality that children are, and will continue to be, born to and raised by parents who are married, those who are unmarried, those who are cohabitating, and those who are single \u2013 most of whom\nwill be heterosexual, some of whom will be gay, and some of whom will be lesbian. Further, the\nliterature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to\nrely) indicates that parents\u2019 financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by\nmarriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized\nunion. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their\nchildren are more likely the result of the way in which society treats them than because of any\ndeficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values.<ref name=\"cpa2006\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn 2007, the [[Australian Psychological Society]] stated: \"The family studies literature indicates that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children\u2019s wellbeing and \u2018outcomes\u2019, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. The research indicates that parenting practices and children\u2019s outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favourable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families. The main reason given (by lawmakers) for not allowing people to marry the person of their choice if that person is of the same gender has been the inaccurate assertion that this is in the best interest of children, and that children \u2018need\u2019 or \u2018do better\u2019 in a family with one parent of each gender. As the reviews, statements, and recommendations written by many expert and professional bodies indicate, this assertion is not supported by the family studies research, and in fact, the promotion of this notion, and the laws and public policies that embody it, are clearly counter to the well-being of children.\"<ref name=apsp/>\n\nMany states and territories with the exception of Northern and Western Australia have laws that allow couples to register their domestic relationships, which is called de facto relationship. There is a concern regarding the rights accorded to family members in this type of relationship.

Harris]]'', upheld a state law defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, in part, by accepting that the marriage procreation link although maybe not wise wasn't irrational. However, in 2006, the New Jersey state Supreme Court unanimously overruled that decision, requiring the state to make available to all couples in New Jersey the equal protection of family laws irrespective of the gender of the participants but not necessarily the title.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 2003, the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]], in a decision ''Standhardt v. Superior Court'' (77 P.3d 451, 463-464) with regards to Arizona's state marriage law, a three judge panel concluded that the petitioners had failed to prove that the State's prohibition of same sex marriage is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest holding that the State has a legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child-rearing within the marital relationship, and that limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman is rationally related to that interest and that even assuming that the State's reasoning for prohibiting same sex marriage was debatable, it was not 'arbitrary' or 'irrational'.\n\nIn 1971, the [[Supreme Court of Minnesota]], in the decision ''[[Baker v.

The purpose of this article{{clarify|date=January 2015}} was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do.

This equation is one of the basic tools for interpretation of the spectra of stars in astrophysics. By studying the spectra of various stars, one can find their temperature and from that, using Saha's equation, determine the ionisation state of the various elements making up the star. This work was soon extended by [[Ralph H. Fowler]] and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. Saha had previously reached the following conclusion on the subject.<ref>John B. Hearnshaw, ''The Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy'' (2014) p.136</ref>\n\n:\"It will be admitted from what has gone before that the temperature plays the leading role in determining the nature of the stellar spectrum. Too much importance must not be attached to the figures given, for the theory is only a first attempt for quantitatively estimating the physical processes taking place at high temperature.

This equation is one of the basic tools for interpretation of the spectra of stars in astrophysics. By studying the spectra of various stars, one can find their temperature and from that, using Saha's equation, determine the ionisation state of the various elements making up the star. This work was soon extended by [[Ralph H. Fowler]] and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. Saha had previously reached the following conclusion on the subject.<ref>John B. Hearnshaw, ''The Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy'' (2014) p.136</ref>\n\n:\"It will be admitted from what has gone before that the temperature plays the leading role in determining the nature of the stellar spectrum. Too much importance must not be attached to the figures given, for the theory is only a first attempt for quantitatively estimating the physical processes taking place at high temperature. We have practically no laboratory data to guide us, but the stellar spectra may be regarded as unfolding to us, in an unbroken sequence, the physical processes succeeding each other as the temperature is continually varied from 3000 K to 40,000 K.\"\n\nSaha also invented an instrument to measure the weight and pressure of solar rays and helped to build several scientific institutions, such as the Physics Department in [[University of Allahabad|Allahabad University]] and the [[Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in Calcutta.

At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became acquainted with [[University of Bologna]] physicist [[Augusto Righi]], who had done research on [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.<ref>[http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/English/scientists/marconi-1.html Guglielmo Marconi (Fabrizio B\u00f2noli, Giorgio Dragoni)]. Scienzagiovane.unibo.it. Retrieved on 10 June 2016.</ref>\n\n===Radio work===\nFrom youth, Marconi was interested in science and [[electricity]]. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\"\u2014i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]. At the time, this radiation was commonly called \"Hertzian\" waves, and is now generally referred to as [[radio waves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm|title=22. Word Origins|work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref>\n\nThere was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method.  Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.<ref>Regal, Brian (2005) ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 22. {{ISBN|0313331677}}</ref> Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]] and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi.

It consisted of an elevated copper sheet ''(top)'' connected to a Righi spark gap ''(left)'' powered by an [[induction coil]] ''(center)'' with a [[telegraph key]] ''(right)'' to switch it on and off to spell out text messages in [[Morse code]]. ]]\n\nAt the age of 20, Marconi began to conduct experiments in radio waves, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of [[Sasso Marconi]]), [[Italy]] with the help of his butler Mignani. Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a [[coherer]], an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]] and used in Lodge's experiments, that [[Electrical resistance and conductance|changed resistance]] when exposed to radio waves.<ref name=\"Brown141\">Brown, Antony. ''Great Ideas in Communications''. D. White Co., 1969, page 141</ref> In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nLate one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.<ref>[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html ''Guglielmo Marconi, padre della radio'']. Radiomarconi.com. Retrieved on 12 July 2012.</ref><ref name=\"Brown141\"/> Supported by his father, Marconi continued to read through the literature and picked up on the ideas of physicists who were experimenting with radio waves.

Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, [[Annibale Ferrero]], explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to England where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use.\nFinding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at Dover, and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office. During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled \"Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor\", which would become the first patent for a radio wave base communication system.<ref>[http://www.seas.columbia.edu/marconi/history.html Guglielmo Marconi, seas.columbia.edu]</ref>\n\n====The British become interested====\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Post Office Engineers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[British Post Office]] engineers inspect Marconi's radio equipment during a demonstration on [[Flat Holm]] Island, 13 May 1897.

In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]], in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyds between [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], [[Northern Ireland]], was conducted on 6 July 1898. A transmission across the [[English channel]] was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from [[Wimereux]], France to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England.  Marconi set up an experimental base at the Haven Hotel, [[Sandbanks]], [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], where he erected a 100-foot high mast.  He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of [[Brownsea Island]] in Poole Harbour, and his sailing boat, the Elettra, was often moored on Brownsea or at the Haven Hotel when he was not conducting experiments at sea.\n\nIn December 1898, the British lightship service authorized the establishment of wireless communication between the [[South Foreland]] lighthouse at [[Dover]] and the East Goodwin [[Lightvessel|lightship]], twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent the first [[SOS]] message, a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel ''Elbe'' which had run aground on [[Goodwin Sands]]. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the [[Ramsgate]] lifeboat.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030656105;view=1up;seq=117 \"Marconi's Wireless Telegraph] by Cleveland Moffett, ''McClure's Magazine'', June 1899, pages 99-112.</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/first-ever-radio-distress-call/ The first-ever radio distress call is made off Kent coast]</ref>\n[[File:SS Ponce Entering New York Harbor 1899, by Milton J.

Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, [[Co. Wexford]] in 1901 to act as a link between [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]] and [[Clifden]] in [[Co. Galway]], [[Ireland]]. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of Canada) on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}. It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248 850&nbsp;kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAP.2004.1305565|year=2004|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=46|issue=2|page=130|title=Marconi and the History of Radio}}</ref><ref>Belrose, John S.

War Wellcome V0003849.jpg|right|thumb|Marconi caricatured by [[Leslie Ward]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1905]]\n\nFeeling challenged by skeptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}. The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n\nOn 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.\n\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}</ref><ref>[http://marconi100.ca/clip/marconi-sydpost19071024.html Second Test of the Marconi Over-Ocean Wireless System Proved Entirely Successful].

After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] of the [[Cunard Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eaton, John P. and Haas, Charles A. (1994) ''Titanic \u2013 Triumph and Tragedy, A Chronicle in Words and Pictures''. {{ISBN|0857330241}}.</ref> Also employed by the Marconi Company was [[David Sarnoff]], who later headed RCA.

When ''Carpathia'' docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from ''[[The New York Times]]'' to talk with Bride, the surviving operator.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry into the loss of ''Titanic'' regarding the marine telegraphy's functions and the procedures for emergencies at sea.<ref>Court of Inquiry ''Loss of the S.S.

Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Great Baddow]], forming the prelude to the [[BBC]], and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with [[Florence Tyzack Parbury]], and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.\n\n===Later years===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{quote box|align=left|width=33%|quote = Have I done the world good, or have I added a menace?<ref>William John (1972) ''History Of The Marconi Company 1874\u20131965''. p. 296</ref>}}</div>\n\n[[File:Marconi portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Marconi with his wife c. 1910]]\nIn 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the UK.

Scienzagiovane.unibo.it. Retrieved on 10 June 2016.</ref>\n\n===Radio work===\nFrom youth, Marconi was interested in science and [[electricity]]. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\"\u2014i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]. At the time, this radiation was commonly called \"Hertzian\" waves, and is now generally referred to as [[radio waves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm|title=22. Word Origins|work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref>\n\nThere was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method.  Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.<ref>Regal, Brian (2005) ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''.

Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a [[coherer]], an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]] and used in Lodge's experiments, that [[Electrical resistance and conductance|changed resistance]] when exposed to radio waves.<ref name=\"Brown141\">Brown, Antony.

White Co., 1969, page 141</ref> In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nLate one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.<ref>[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html ''Guglielmo Marconi, padre della radio''].

Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, [[Annibale Ferrero]], explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to England where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use.\nFinding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at Dover, and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office. During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled \"Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor\", which would become the first patent for a radio wave base communication system.<ref>[http://www.seas.columbia.edu/marconi/history.html Guglielmo Marconi, seas.columbia.edu]</ref>\n\n====The British become interested====\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Post Office Engineers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[British Post Office]] engineers inspect Marconi's radio equipment during a demonstration on [[Flat Holm]] Island, 13 May 1897.

In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]], in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyds between [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], [[Northern Ireland]], was conducted on 6 July 1898. A transmission across the [[English channel]] was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from [[Wimereux]], France to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England.  Marconi set up an experimental base at the Haven Hotel, [[Sandbanks]], [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], where he erected a 100-foot high mast.  He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of [[Brownsea Island]] in Poole Harbour, and his sailing boat, the Elettra, was often moored on Brownsea or at the Haven Hotel when he was not conducting experiments at sea.\n\nIn December 1898, the British lightship service authorized the establishment of wireless communication between the [[South Foreland]] lighthouse at [[Dover]] and the East Goodwin [[Lightvessel|lightship]], twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent the first [[SOS]] message, a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel ''Elbe'' which had run aground on [[Goodwin Sands]]. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the [[Ramsgate]] lifeboat.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030656105;view=1up;seq=117 \"Marconi's Wireless Telegraph] by Cleveland Moffett, ''McClure's Magazine'', June 1899, pages 99-112.</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/first-ever-radio-distress-call/ The first-ever radio distress call is made off Kent coast]</ref>\n[[File:SS Ponce Entering New York Harbor 1899, by Milton J.

Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, [[Co. Wexford]] in 1901 to act as a link between [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]] and [[Clifden]] in [[Co. Galway]], [[Ireland]]. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of Canada) on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}. It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248 850&nbsp;kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAP.2004.1305565|year=2004|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=46|issue=2|page=130|title=Marconi and the History of Radio}}</ref><ref>Belrose, John S.

War Wellcome V0003849.jpg|right|thumb|Marconi caricatured by [[Leslie Ward]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1905]]\n\nFeeling challenged by skeptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}. The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n\nOn 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.\n\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}</ref><ref>[http://marconi100.ca/clip/marconi-sydpost19071024.html Second Test of the Marconi Over-Ocean Wireless System Proved Entirely Successful].

After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] of the [[Cunard Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eaton, John P. and Haas, Charles A.

Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Great Baddow]], forming the prelude to the [[BBC]], and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with [[Florence Tyzack Parbury]], and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.\n\n===Later years===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{quote box|align=left|width=33%|quote = Have I done the world good, or have I added a menace?<ref>William John (1972) ''History Of The Marconi Company 1874\u20131965''. p. 296</ref>}}</div>\n\n[[File:Marconi portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Marconi with his wife c. 1910]]\nIn 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the UK.

In 1900, Detroit had a population of 285,000 people, making it the thirteenth-largest city in the U.S.<ref name=\"Sugrue 2004\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life andSociety | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Over the following decades, the growth of the automobile industry, including affiliated activities such as parts manufacturing, came to dwarf all other manufacturing in the city. The industry drew a million new residents to the city.  At [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]]'s iconic and enormous [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge plant]] alone, opened in 1927 in  Detroit's neighbor [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], there were over 90,000 workers.<ref name=\"Sugrue 2004\"/> The shifting nature of the workforce stimulated by the rapid growth of the auto industry had an important impact on the city's future development. The new workers came from diverse and soon far-flung sources. Nearby [[Canada]] was important early on and many other workers came from eastern and southern Europe, a large portion of them being ethnic Italians, Hungarians, and Poles. An important attraction for these workers was that the new assembly line techniques required little prior training or education to get a job in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe breadth of sources for the growing demand for auto assembly workers, however, was sharply limited by the turmoil of [[World War I]], and shortly thereafter by the restrictive U.S. [[Immigration Act of 1924]], with its limited annual quotas for new immigrants. In response, the industry - with Ford in the forefront - turned in a significant way to hiring African-Americans, who were [[Great Migration (African American)|leaving the South in huge numbers]] in response to the combination of a post-war agricultural slump and continuing [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> At the same time large numbers of southern whites were hired, as well as large numbers of Mexicans, since immigration from most of the western hemisphere was not restricted at all by new immigration quotas. By 1930 Detroit's population had grown to nearly 1.6 million, and then to nearly 2 million by its peak shortly before 1950. A World War II boom in the manufacture of [[Materiel|war materiel]] contributed to this growth surge.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview2.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> This population was, however, very spread out in comparison with other U.S. industrial cities. A variety of factors associated with the auto industry fed this trend. There was the large influx of workers. They earned comparatively high wages in the auto industry. The plants they worked at, belonging to various major and minor manufacturers, were spread around the city. The workers tended to live along extended bus and streetcar lines leading to their workplaces. The result of these influences, beginning already by the 1920s, was that many workers bought or built their own single-family or duplex homes. They did not tend to live in large apartment houses, as in New York, or in closely spaced row houses as in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" /> After [[New Deal]] labor legislation, auto-union secured wages and benefits facilitated this willingness to take on the cost and risk of home ownership.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" />\n\nThese decentralizing trends did not have equal effects on African-American residents of the city. They tended to have far less access to New Deal mortgage support programs such as [[Federal Housing Authority]] and [[Veterans Administration]] insured mortgages. African-American neighborhoods were viewed by lenders and the federal programs as riskier, resulting \u2013 in this period \u2013 in much lower rates of homeownership for African-Americans than other residents of the city.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" />\n\nIn contrast, the auto industry also gave rise to a very large and well-compensated layer of managers and executives. There were also large numbers of attorneys, advertising executives, and other white-collar workers who supported the industry's managerial force. These white-collar workers already by the 1920s had begun to move to neighborhoods well removed from the industry's factories and the neighborhoods of their workers.  This upper stratum moved to outlying neighborhoods, and further, to well-to-do suburbs such as [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] and [[Grosse Pointe]]. [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]], north of the city, became a popular place to live for executives in the industry. \"By the second half of the twentieth century, it was one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, a place profoundly shaped by the concentration of auto-industry-derived wealth.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview2.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPublic policy was automobile oriented. Funds were directed to the building of expressways for automobile traffic, to the detriment of public transit and the [[inner-city]] neighborhoods through which the expressways were cut to get to the auto factories and the downtown office buildings.<ref name=\"RefC\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview3.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThese processes, in which the growth of the auto industry had played such a large part, combined with racial segregation to give Detroit, by 1960, its particularly noteworthy character of a substantially African-American inner city surrounded by mainly white outer sections of the city and suburbs.  By 1960 there were more whites living in the city's suburbs than the city itself.  On the other hand, there were very few African-Americans in the suburbs.  Real estate agents [[redlining|would not sell to them]], and if African-Americans did try to move into suburbs there was \"intense hostility and often violence\" in reaction.<ref name=\"RefC\"/>\n\nThe auto industry too was decentralizing away from Detroit proper.  This change was facilitated by the great concentration of automobile production into the hands of the \"Big Three\" of [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]].  The Big Three were able to [[Oligopoly|put nearly every smaller competitor automaker out of business.]]  While this corporate concentration was taking place, the Big Three were shifting their production out of central Detroit.  Between 1945 and 1957 the Big Three built 25 new manufacturing plants in the metropolitan area, not one of them in the city itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview4.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe number and character of these new, suburban auto factories was a harbinger of future trends detrimental to the economic health of Detroit.  There was an interaction between factory decentralization and the nature of the industry's post-New Deal unionized labor force.  Ford Motor was one of the first to undertake major decentralization, in reaction to labor developments. Ford's workers voted to join the [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]] in 1941.  This led Ford to be concerned about the vulnerability of its huge flagship Rouge River plant to [[labor unrest]].  The workers at this plant were \"among the industry's most well-organized, racially and ethnically diverse, and militant.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}  A strike at this key plant could bring the company's manufacturing operations as a whole to a halt.  Ford therefore decentralized operations from this plant, to soften union power (and to introduce new technologies in new plants, and expand to new markets).  Ford often built up parallel production facilities, making the same products, so that the effect of a strike at any one facility would be lessened.  The results for the River Rouge plant are striking.  From its peak labor force of 90,000 around 1930, the number of workers there declined to 30,000 by 1960 and only about 6,000 by 1990. This decline was mainly due to automation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe spread of the auto industry outward from Detroit proper in the 1950s was the beginning of a process that extended much further afield.  Auto plants and the parts suppliers associated with the industry were relocated to the southern U.S., and to Canada and Mexico.  The major auto plants left in Detroit were closed down, and their workers increasingly left behind.  When the auto industry's facilities moved out, there were dramatically adverse economic ripple effects on the city.  The neighborhood businesses that had catered to auto workers shut down.  This direct and indirect economic contraction caused the city to lose property taxes, wage taxes, and population (and thus consumer demand).  The closed auto plants were also often abandoned in a period before strong environmental regulation, causing the sites to become so-called \"brownfields,\" unattractive to potential replacement businesses because of the pollution hangover from decades of industrial production.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview5.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>  The pattern of the deteriorating city by the mid-1960s was visibly associated with the largely departed auto industry. The neighborhoods with the most closed stores, vacant houses, and abandoned lots were in what had formerly been the most heavily populated parts of the city, adjacent to the now-closed older major auto plants.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Michigan Central Train Station Exterior 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Michigan Central Station]] and its [[Amtrak]] connection went out of service in 1988, under pressure from growing [[Automotive city|car-centrism]].]]\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, the auto industry suffered setbacks that further impacted Detroit.  The industry encountered the rise of [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] and the resulting sharp increase in gasoline prices.  It faced new and intense international competition, particularly from Italian, Japanese and German makers. Chrysler avoided bankruptcy in the late 1970s only with the aid of a federal bailout. GM and Ford also struggled financially. The industry fought to regain its competitive footing but did so in very substantial part by introducing cost-cutting techniques focused on automation and thus reduction of labor cost and the number of workers. It also relocated ever more of its manufacturing to lower-cost states in the U.S. and to low-income countries. Detroit's residents thus had access to fewer and fewer well-paying, secure auto manufacturing jobs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe leadership of Detroit made little attempt to diversify the city's economy. Because the city had flourished in the heyday of the auto industry, local politicians made periodic attempts to stimulate a revival of the auto industry in the city.  For example, in the 1980s the cities of Detroit and [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] used the power of [[eminent domain]] to level part of what had been [[Poletown East, Detroit|Poletown]] to make a parking lot for a new automobile factory. On that site, a new, low-rise suburban type Cadillac plant was built, with substantial government subsidies.

During the Roaring Twenties, African American neighborhoods in Detroit experienced a renaissance; one full of prosperity, livelihood, and industry within black communities. However, due to the economic hardships of manufacturing industries, these communities fell on hard times, and devolved into decrepit remnants of what they once were. These areas soon became overcrowded, underfunded, and mistreated. Moreover, the mass migration of hopeful blacks from the South into these neighborhoods exacerbated their problem with overpopulation. Given the lack of industry, terrible living conditions, and overpopulation, many black citizens sought a way out, but found it was not easy.\n\nWhite Detroiters and some wealthier black communities used various methods to restrict the movement of black citizens into predominantly white neighborhoods. Real estate agents and white homeowners often used a tactic called redlining. The Home Owners Loan Corporation, which was charged with deciding which areas were suitable for housing loans, would mark black neighborhoods in red, flagging the area as unsuitable for federal loans and subsidies. This red-line prevented blacks from the ability to attain loans from banks to build new houses or make improvements on existing ones. This also contributed to the racial prejudice against blacks. Having a black resident in a white neighborhood greatly depreciated home values, further motivating white Detroiters to keep their neighborhoods segregated. There were no major alternate means of obtaining loans, and government and state loans were the only means of getting a new home. This red-line allowed whites to restrict the movement of blacks into white areas by eliminating their ability to obtain loans, thus maintaining segregated neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition to the already effective redlining, neighborhood associations would often mandate restrictive covenants onto their buildings in order to prevent black families from moving in. These covenants were sometimes explicitly discriminatory and took the form of; \"people of color can't purchase this home,\" or only for the \"caucasian race.\" However, after certain hallmark legal cases of discrimination in housing such as ''Shelley vs Kraemer'' deemed restrictive covenants unconstitutional, neighborhood associations had to change their practices. To circumvent political hurdles, covenants were often changed to restrict boarding or dividing houses into multiple family units. Because African-Americans could not get loans, splitting the house was one of only a few feasible options, and these covenants took it away.\n\nThe creation of New Deal programs during the 1930s, although unintentional, further restricted black agency and movement. It established a strong relationship between patriotism and homeownership. Working and middle class homeowners started to fiercely oppose integration and the construction of public housing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Real estate agents and homeowners believed that having affordable public housing and more black residents would force home values to depreciate. Many middle class homeowners were also upset by the fact that they were unable to get government loans and subsidies while so much money was being put into low-cost housing projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fdrlibrary.org/housing|title=FDR and Housing Legislation|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2019|website=FDR Library & Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=}}</ref> This made them cling on to their homes even tighter.\n\nNeighborhood associations and the ability of de facto discrimination to influence discriminatory policy curbed efforts to combat racism in housing and allowed whites to prevent integrated neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations hell-bent on preventing integrating housing elected officials who supported their anti-integration agendas. Moreover, already elected politicians were controlled by their anti-integration constituents regardless if the politicians were actually anti-housing or not. This can be seen in the election of Mayor Albert Cobo. Cobo, a staunch opponent of integrated housing, dismantled the Mayor's Interracial Committee, a large advocate group for housing equality, and took additional measures to disband organizations and government policies that would be beneficial to integrated housing. Cobo's regime demonstrated how de facto discrimination could influence de jure discrimination, and contribute to overall racism in housing.\n\n===The open housing movement===\nIn 1948, ''Shelley v. Kraemer'' and three other United States Supreme Court cases established that state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants were unconstitutional.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-691-12186-4|location=41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540|pages=73}}</ref> This decision revitalized the advocacy for integrated neighborhoods. Suburbs around Detroit expanded dramatically as wealthy African-Americans began to move into white neighborhoods. The singular asset that many white residents held after World War II was their home, and they feared that if Black people moved in, the value of their homes would plummet. This fear was preyed upon by [[blockbusting]] real estate agents who would manipulate Whites into selling their homes for cheap prices by convincing them that African-Americans were infiltrating the neighborhood. They would even send Black children to go door to door with pamphlets that read, \"Now is the best time to sell your house\u2014you know that.\" With the means to pick up and leave, many white residents fled to the surrounding suburbs. This \"[[white flight]]\" took much away from the city: residents, the middle class, and tax revenues which kept up public services such as schools, police, and parks. Blockbusting agents then profited by reselling these houses at incredibly marked-up prices to African-Americans desperate to get out of the inner city.\n\nThese inflated prices were only affordable by the black \u201celite.\u201d As wealthier black Detroiters moved into the previously white neighborhoods, they left behind low income residents in the most inadequate houses at the highest rental. Redlining, restrictive covenants, local politics, and the open housing movement all contributed to the restricted movement of black, low-income Detroiters.\n\n=== 1950s job losses ===\n\n[[File:Abandoned Packard Automobile Factory Detroit 200.jpg|thumb|[[Packard Automotive Plant]], closed since 1958]]\nIn the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs.  Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, consolidation of the auto industry, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the construction of the highway system that eased transportation for commuters. Major companies like [[Packard]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], and [[Studebaker]], as well as hundreds of smaller companies, declined significantly or went out of business entirely. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent.\n\n=== 1950s to 1960s freeway construction ===\n{{See also|Automotive city}}\nBy the late 1940s, the economic wounds from years of redlining and restrictive covenants hurt the standard of living for many African Americans and minorities living in Detroit. With limited housing opportunities and sky-high rents, those living in \u201cred\u201d neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley often had little financial ability to pay for private apartments or even housing repairs. Consequences of close-quarter living were exacerbated by an influx of black immigrants during the Great Migration and World War II. The decaying neighborhoods also developed sanitation problems; garbage pickups were rare and trash littered the street, accelerating the spread of diseases and enticing pests.<ref name=\":0\" /> Perceptions of \u201curban blight\u201d and a need for \u201cslum clearance\u201d in these areas were fueled especially by (majority white) Detroit city planners, who classified over two-thirds of housing in Paradise Valley as substandard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA plan for \u201curban renewal\u201d in Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods was put forth by Detroit Mayor Edward Jeffries in 1944. Utilizing eminent domain laws, the government began taking down buildings in the Black Bottom neighborhood in 1949.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganradio.org/post/how-razing-detroit-s-black-bottom-neighborhood-shaped-michigan-s-history|title=How the razing of Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood shaped Michigan's history|last=Staff|first=Stateside|website=www.michiganradio.org|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> The push for urban renewal in post-World War II Detroit was popularized by local government officials, in conjunction with real estate agents and bank owners of the time, who stood to gain from investment in new buildings and wealthier residents. When the 1956 Highway Act mandated new highways routed through Detroit, the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley areas were an ideal placement; deconstruction of the site had already been started, and the political clout of slum clearance was more powerful than the limited ability residents had to advocate against the placement.\n\nThough it faced urban poverty and overcrowding, the Black Bottom neighborhoods were an exciting mix of culture and innovation, with the economic district boasting approximately 350 black-owned businesses.<ref name=\":3\" /> The downtown area is often described as if Motown music played even from the pipes in the street. But when highway projects were announced, sometimes years before construction started and sometimes warning only thirty days in advance, the property values for those who did own land disappeared.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|date=December 1998|title=Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=47|doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1718|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> The forced relocation condemned many residents to even harsher poverty, and the local government commissions made few efforts to assist families in relocation. It was difficult enough for the thousands of persons displaced to find new housing in a time where restrictive covenants, even though technically outlawed in 1948, were deftly and covertly written into many of Detroit's surrounding neighborhoods. It was even harder for business owners to relocate their life's work. Lasting ramifications of the highway construction are still felt by the black business sector in Detroit today.\n\nThe Oakland-Hastings Freeway, now called the I-375 Chrysler Highway, was laid directly along Hastings Street at the heart of the Black Bottom business district, and cut through the Lower East Side and Paradise Valley as well.<ref name=\":4\" /> For the construction of the Edsel Ford Expressway (I-94) alone, 2,800 buildings from the West Side and northern Paradise Valley were demolished, including former jazz nightclubs, churches, community buildings, businesses and homes. The Lower West Side was mostly destroyed by the John C. Lodge Freeway, which also ran through black neighborhoods outside of Twelfth Street and Highland Park.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhat was once a diverse, thriving home to thousands of people quickly became a monument to the misguided and racist views of the city officials and planners of Detroit at the time. The highways catalyzed the decline of Detroit. Although planners envisioned them as necessary for a grander future Detroit, even when they were constructed the size of the roads were superfluous and better fit for a city with twice the population of Detroit. It created a second housing crisis and further encouraged residents to move out of the city and commute downtown to work, both of which drained money from Detroit's inner city. The highways reinforced the Motor City as just that: a place rumbling with engines from nine to five, but quieter and more deserted than it ever had been when the work day ended.\n\nA letter from a Mrs. Grace Black found in the Bentley Historical Library's historical archives illustrates the struggles of finding housing with children in the midst of highway construction:<blockquote>Sept 1950</blockquote><blockquote>Governor Williams:</blockquote><blockquote>Please consider a family of 6 who are desperately in need of a house to rent. Husband, wife, and four lonely children, who have been turned down because we have children. We are now living in a house of the Edsel Ford Express Highway. We have our notice to move on out before the 23rd of Oct. So far we haven't found a place to move. Nobody want to rent us because we have children. My children aren't destructive but nobody will give us a chance to find out if they are or not. We are so comfortable here. It's the first freedom we've enjoyed since we've had children. My husband work at children's hospital only mak $60 a week. Sixty dollars we are paying $50 a month which we don't mind because we are comfortable. This will be demolished if we were able we would buy this house. But are not. So if anything you can do will be appreciated from the depths of our hearts. You have done so much to help the lower income families. We are deeply grateful wishing you God's speed. This is urgent! Please give this your immediate consideration.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you</blockquote><blockquote>Mrs. Grace Black (a worried mother)</blockquote>\n\nI-75, Ford Field, and Comerica Park now occupy most of the area where Paradise Valley once stood. Historian [[Thomas Sugrue]] notes that of the families displaced by the razing of the Paradise Valley neighborhood:\n\n{{quote|[A]bout one-third of the Gratiot-area\u2019s families eventually moved to public housing, but 35 percent of the families in the area could not be traced.

The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterward, it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion, the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand.

There were numerous major criminal gangs that were founded in Detroit and that dominated the drug trade at various times, though most were short-lived.

A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Young, \"a vision from hell.\" During the height of the drug era, Detroit residents routinely set fire to houses that were known as popular [[crack house|drug-dealing locations]], accusing the city's police of being either unwilling or unable to solve the deep problems of the city.<ref>Coleman Young and Lonnie Wheeler, ''Hard Stuff: The Autobiography of Mayor Coleman Young'' (1994) p 282</ref>\n\nThe arson primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly destructive throughout this period. Over 800 fires were set, mostly to vacant houses, in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city's fire department. In later years, the arsons continued, but the frequency of these fires was reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses, buildings that were, in many cases, used to sell drugs. 5,000 of these buildings were razed in 1989\u201390 alone.

Most notably, Dan Gilbert has heavily invested in the acquisition and revitalization of a number of historic buildings in the Downtown area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2018/05/02/dan-gilbert-chris-ilitch-panel-detroit-real-estate/34479969/|title=Gilbert, Ilitch pitch Detroit to real estate convention|work=Detroit News|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> A primary focus of private real estate investment has been to position Detroit's Central Business District as an attractive site for the investment of technology companies. Approaches to the private investment of Midtown, however, have prioritized re-establishing Midtown as the cultural and commercial center of the city. Public transportation within the Downtown area has also been a target for private investors, as evidenced by Quicken Loans' investment in Detroit's [[QLine]] railcar, which currently runs a {{convert|3.3|mi}} track along Woodward Avenue.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Shawn D | title = Amid Detroit area transit debate, cue the QLine | newspaper = [[The Detroit News]] | date = 2017-05-11 | url = https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/05/11/amid-detroit-area-transit-debate-cue-qline/101534214/\n | access-date = 2019-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the approach taken by many private investors in the downtown area has been met with several criticisms. Many have argued that the influx of private capital into the Downtown area has resulted in dramatic changes to the social and socio-economic character of the city. Residents have cited fears of physical displacement due to the increase in rent that results from such investments.<ref name=\":1\">Williams, Michael. \u201cListening to Detroit: Perspective on Gentrification in the Motor City.\u201d ''University of Michigan'', 2013.</ref> Additionally, many long-time residents fear that the influx of new capital could result in their political disempowerment; they fear that the city government will become less responsive to their needs if the city government is under the influence of outside investors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther investors, such as John Hantz, are attempting to revitalize Detroit using through another approach: urban agriculture. Unlike Gilbert, Hantz has turned his focus to the blighted neighborhoods in Detroit's residential zones. In 2008, Hantz approached Detroit's city government to propose a plan to remove urban blight by demolishing blighted homes and planting trees to establish a large urban farm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hantzfarmsdetroit.com/whatwehavedone.html|title=What We Have Done {{!}} Hantz Woodlands|website=www.hantzfarmsdetroit.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> Despite fervent criticisms on behalf of city residents claiming that Hantz's proposal amounted to nothing more than a \"land grab,\" the city government eventually approved Hantz's proposal, granting him nearly {{convert|140|acres}} of land. As of 2017, Hantz farms has planted over 24,000 saplings and demolished 62 blighted structures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wxyz.com/news/hantz-farms-seeing-new-success-with-urban-farming-in-detroit|title=Hantz Farms seeing new success with urban farming in Detroit|last=Smith|first=Matthew|date=2017-06-30|work=WXYZ|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> Still, it remains uncertain what Hantz's long-term ambitions are for the project, and many residents speculate future developments on his land.\n\nDetroit's resurgence is also being driven by the formation of public-private-nonprofit partnerships that protect and maintain Detroit's most valuable assets. The [[Detroit Riverfront]], for instance, is maintained and developed almost exclusively through non-profit funding in partnership with public and private enterprises. This model for economic development and revitalization has seen enormous success in Detroit, with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy raising in excess of $23 million to revitalize and maintain riverfront assets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://detroitriverfront.org/news/detroit-riverfront-conservancy-exceeds-capital-campaign-goal-23-million-and-celebrates|title=The Detroit RiverFront Conservancy Exceeds Capital Campaign Goal by $23 Million and Celebrates Transformation of the East Riverfront {{!}} Detroit Riverfront Conservancy|website=detroitriverfront.org|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> This model for economic development is so promising that the city has turned to similar partnership strategies to manage, maintain, and revitalize a number of other city assets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n* [[History of Detroit]]\n* [[Timeline of Detroit]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Deindustrialization]]\n*[[Public housing in Detroit|Housing conditions in Detroit City]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Doucet, Brian. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/feb/17/detroit-gentrification-poverty-public-services-race-divide Detroit's gentrification won't give poor citizens reliable public services]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WPrz2djV?url=http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/feb/17/detroit-gentrification-poverty-public-services-race-divide Archive]).

In 1900, Detroit had a population of 285,000 people, making it the thirteenth-largest city in the U.S.<ref name=\"Sugrue 2004\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life andSociety | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Over the following decades, the growth of the automobile industry, including affiliated activities such as parts manufacturing, came to dwarf all other manufacturing in the city. The industry drew a million new residents to the city.  At [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]]'s iconic and enormous [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge plant]] alone, opened in 1927 in  Detroit's neighbor [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], there were over 90,000 workers.<ref name=\"Sugrue 2004\"/> The shifting nature of the workforce stimulated by the rapid growth of the auto industry had an important impact on the city's future development. The new workers came from diverse and soon far-flung sources. Nearby [[Canada]] was important early on and many other workers came from eastern and southern Europe, a large portion of them being ethnic Italians, Hungarians, and Poles. An important attraction for these workers was that the new assembly line techniques required little prior training or education to get a job in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe breadth of sources for the growing demand for auto assembly workers, however, was sharply limited by the turmoil of [[World War I]], and shortly thereafter by the restrictive U.S. [[Immigration Act of 1924]], with its limited annual quotas for new immigrants. In response, the industry - with Ford in the forefront - turned in a significant way to hiring African-Americans, who were [[Great Migration (African American)|leaving the South in huge numbers]] in response to the combination of a post-war agricultural slump and continuing [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview1.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> At the same time large numbers of southern whites were hired, as well as large numbers of Mexicans, since immigration from most of the western hemisphere was not restricted at all by new immigration quotas. By 1930 Detroit's population had grown to nearly 1.6 million, and then to nearly 2 million by its peak shortly before 1950. A World War II boom in the manufacture of [[Materiel|war materiel]] contributed to this growth surge.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url =http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview2.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> This population was, however, very spread out in comparison with other U.S. industrial cities. A variety of factors associated with the auto industry fed this trend. There was the large influx of workers. They earned comparatively high wages in the auto industry. The plants they worked at, belonging to various major and minor manufacturers, were spread around the city. The workers tended to live along extended bus and streetcar lines leading to their workplaces. The result of these influences, beginning already by the 1920s, was that many workers bought or built their own single-family or duplex homes. They did not tend to live in large apartment houses, as in New York, or in closely spaced row houses as in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" /> After [[New Deal]] labor legislation, auto-union secured wages and benefits facilitated this willingness to take on the cost and risk of home ownership.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" />\n\nThese decentralizing trends did not have equal effects on African-American residents of the city. They tended to have far less access to New Deal mortgage support programs such as [[Federal Housing Authority]] and [[Veterans Administration]] insured mortgages. African-American neighborhoods were viewed by lenders and the federal programs as riskier, resulting \u2013 in this period \u2013 in much lower rates of homeownership for African-Americans than other residents of the city.<ref name=\"autolife.umd.umich.edu\" />\n\nIn contrast, the auto industry also gave rise to a very large and well-compensated layer of managers and executives. There were also large numbers of attorneys, advertising executives, and other white-collar workers who supported the industry's managerial force. These white-collar workers already by the 1920s had begun to move to neighborhoods well removed from the industry's factories and the neighborhoods of their workers.  This upper stratum moved to outlying neighborhoods, and further, to well-to-do suburbs such as [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] and [[Grosse Pointe]]. [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]], north of the city, became a popular place to live for executives in the industry. \"By the second half of the twentieth century, it was one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, a place profoundly shaped by the concentration of auto-industry-derived wealth.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview2.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPublic policy was automobile oriented. Funds were directed to the building of expressways for automobile traffic, to the detriment of public transit and the [[inner-city]] neighborhoods through which the expressways were cut to get to the auto factories and the downtown office buildings.<ref name=\"RefC\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview3.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThese processes, in which the growth of the auto industry had played such a large part, combined with racial segregation to give Detroit, by 1960, its particularly noteworthy character of a substantially African-American inner city surrounded by mainly white outer sections of the city and suburbs.  By 1960 there were more whites living in the city's suburbs than the city itself.  On the other hand, there were very few African-Americans in the suburbs.  Real estate agents [[redlining|would not sell to them]], and if African-Americans did try to move into suburbs there was \"intense hostility and often violence\" in reaction.<ref name=\"RefC\"/>\n\nThe auto industry too was decentralizing away from Detroit proper.  This change was facilitated by the great concentration of automobile production into the hands of the \"Big Three\" of [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]].  The Big Three were able to [[Oligopoly|put nearly every smaller competitor automaker out of business.]]  While this corporate concentration was taking place, the Big Three were shifting their production out of central Detroit.  Between 1945 and 1957 the Big Three built 25 new manufacturing plants in the metropolitan area, not one of them in the city itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview4.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe number and character of these new, suburban auto factories was a harbinger of future trends detrimental to the economic health of Detroit.  There was an interaction between factory decentralization and the nature of the industry's post-New Deal unionized labor force.  Ford Motor was one of the first to undertake major decentralization, in reaction to labor developments. Ford's workers voted to join the [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]] in 1941.  This led Ford to be concerned about the vulnerability of its huge flagship Rouge River plant to [[labor unrest]].  The workers at this plant were \"among the industry's most well-organized, racially and ethnically diverse, and militant.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}  A strike at this key plant could bring the company's manufacturing operations as a whole to a halt.  Ford therefore decentralized operations from this plant, to soften union power (and to introduce new technologies in new plants, and expand to new markets).  Ford often built up parallel production facilities, making the same products, so that the effect of a strike at any one facility would be lessened.  The results for the River Rouge plant are striking.  From its peak labor force of 90,000 around 1930, the number of workers there declined to 30,000 by 1960 and only about 6,000 by 1990. This decline was mainly due to automation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe spread of the auto industry outward from Detroit proper in the 1950s was the beginning of a process that extended much further afield.  Auto plants and the parts suppliers associated with the industry were relocated to the southern U.S., and to Canada and Mexico.  The major auto plants left in Detroit were closed down, and their workers increasingly left behind.  When the auto industry's facilities moved out, there were dramatically adverse economic ripple effects on the city.  The neighborhood businesses that had catered to auto workers shut down.  This direct and indirect economic contraction caused the city to lose property taxes, wage taxes, and population (and thus consumer demand).  The closed auto plants were also often abandoned in a period before strong environmental regulation, causing the sites to become so-called \"brownfields,\" unattractive to potential replacement businesses because of the pollution hangover from decades of industrial production.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Sugrue |url = http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview5.htm |title = From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America | series = Automobile in American Life and Society | publisher = University of Michigan - Dearborn |year = 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>  The pattern of the deteriorating city by the mid-1960s was visibly associated with the largely departed auto industry. The neighborhoods with the most closed stores, vacant houses, and abandoned lots were in what had formerly been the most heavily populated parts of the city, adjacent to the now-closed older major auto plants.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Michigan Central Train Station Exterior 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Michigan Central Station]] and its [[Amtrak]] connection went out of service in 1988, under pressure from growing [[Automotive city|car-centrism]].]]\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, the auto industry suffered setbacks that further impacted Detroit.  The industry encountered the rise of [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] and the resulting sharp increase in gasoline prices.  It faced new and intense international competition, particularly from Italian, Japanese and German makers. Chrysler avoided bankruptcy in the late 1970s only with the aid of a federal bailout. GM and Ford also struggled financially. The industry fought to regain its competitive footing but did so in very substantial part by introducing cost-cutting techniques focused on automation and thus reduction of labor cost and the number of workers. It also relocated ever more of its manufacturing to lower-cost states in the U.S. and to low-income countries. Detroit's residents thus had access to fewer and fewer well-paying, secure auto manufacturing jobs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe leadership of Detroit made little attempt to diversify the city's economy. Because the city had flourished in the heyday of the auto industry, local politicians made periodic attempts to stimulate a revival of the auto industry in the city.

During the Roaring Twenties, African American neighborhoods in Detroit experienced a renaissance; one full of prosperity, livelihood, and industry within black communities. However, due to the economic hardships of manufacturing industries, these communities fell on hard times, and devolved into decrepit remnants of what they once were. These areas soon became overcrowded, underfunded, and mistreated. Moreover, the mass migration of hopeful blacks from the South into these neighborhoods exacerbated their problem with overpopulation. Given the lack of industry, terrible living conditions, and overpopulation, many black citizens sought a way out, but found it was not easy.\n\nWhite Detroiters and some wealthier black communities used various methods to restrict the movement of black citizens into predominantly white neighborhoods. Real estate agents and white homeowners often used a tactic called redlining. The Home Owners Loan Corporation, which was charged with deciding which areas were suitable for housing loans, would mark black neighborhoods in red, flagging the area as unsuitable for federal loans and subsidies. This red-line prevented blacks from the ability to attain loans from banks to build new houses or make improvements on existing ones. This also contributed to the racial prejudice against blacks. Having a black resident in a white neighborhood greatly depreciated home values, further motivating white Detroiters to keep their neighborhoods segregated. There were no major alternate means of obtaining loans, and government and state loans were the only means of getting a new home. This red-line allowed whites to restrict the movement of blacks into white areas by eliminating their ability to obtain loans, thus maintaining segregated neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition to the already effective redlining, neighborhood associations would often mandate restrictive covenants onto their buildings in order to prevent black families from moving in. These covenants were sometimes explicitly discriminatory and took the form of; \"people of color can't purchase this home,\" or only for the \"caucasian race.\" However, after certain hallmark legal cases of discrimination in housing such as ''Shelley vs Kraemer'' deemed restrictive covenants unconstitutional, neighborhood associations had to change their practices. To circumvent political hurdles, covenants were often changed to restrict boarding or dividing houses into multiple family units. Because African-Americans could not get loans, splitting the house was one of only a few feasible options, and these covenants took it away.\n\nThe creation of New Deal programs during the 1930s, although unintentional, further restricted black agency and movement. It established a strong relationship between patriotism and homeownership. Working and middle class homeowners started to fiercely oppose integration and the construction of public housing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Real estate agents and homeowners believed that having affordable public housing and more black residents would force home values to depreciate. Many middle class homeowners were also upset by the fact that they were unable to get government loans and subsidies while so much money was being put into low-cost housing projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fdrlibrary.org/housing|title=FDR and Housing Legislation|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2019|website=FDR Library & Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=}}</ref> This made them cling on to their homes even tighter.\n\nNeighborhood associations and the ability of de facto discrimination to influence discriminatory policy curbed efforts to combat racism in housing and allowed whites to prevent integrated neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations hell-bent on preventing integrating housing elected officials who supported their anti-integration agendas. Moreover, already elected politicians were controlled by their anti-integration constituents regardless if the politicians were actually anti-housing or not. This can be seen in the election of Mayor Albert Cobo. Cobo, a staunch opponent of integrated housing, dismantled the Mayor's Interracial Committee, a large advocate group for housing equality, and took additional measures to disband organizations and government policies that would be beneficial to integrated housing. Cobo's regime demonstrated how de facto discrimination could influence de jure discrimination, and contribute to overall racism in housing.\n\n===The open housing movement===\nIn 1948, ''Shelley v. Kraemer'' and three other United States Supreme Court cases established that state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants were unconstitutional.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-691-12186-4|location=41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540|pages=73}}</ref> This decision revitalized the advocacy for integrated neighborhoods. Suburbs around Detroit expanded dramatically as wealthy African-Americans began to move into white neighborhoods. The singular asset that many white residents held after World War II was their home, and they feared that if Black people moved in, the value of their homes would plummet. This fear was preyed upon by [[blockbusting]] real estate agents who would manipulate Whites into selling their homes for cheap prices by convincing them that African-Americans were infiltrating the neighborhood. They would even send Black children to go door to door with pamphlets that read, \"Now is the best time to sell your house\u2014you know that.\" With the means to pick up and leave, many white residents fled to the surrounding suburbs. This \"[[white flight]]\" took much away from the city: residents, the middle class, and tax revenues which kept up public services such as schools, police, and parks. Blockbusting agents then profited by reselling these houses at incredibly marked-up prices to African-Americans desperate to get out of the inner city.\n\nThese inflated prices were only affordable by the black \u201celite.\u201d As wealthier black Detroiters moved into the previously white neighborhoods, they left behind low income residents in the most inadequate houses at the highest rental. Redlining, restrictive covenants, local politics, and the open housing movement all contributed to the restricted movement of black, low-income Detroiters.\n\n=== 1950s job losses ===\n\n[[File:Abandoned Packard Automobile Factory Detroit 200.jpg|thumb|[[Packard Automotive Plant]], closed since 1958]]\nIn the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs.  Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, consolidation of the auto industry, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the construction of the highway system that eased transportation for commuters. Major companies like [[Packard]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], and [[Studebaker]], as well as hundreds of smaller companies, declined significantly or went out of business entirely. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent.\n\n=== 1950s to 1960s freeway construction ===\n{{See also|Automotive city}}\nBy the late 1940s, the economic wounds from years of redlining and restrictive covenants hurt the standard of living for many African Americans and minorities living in Detroit. With limited housing opportunities and sky-high rents, those living in \u201cred\u201d neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley often had little financial ability to pay for private apartments or even housing repairs. Consequences of close-quarter living were exacerbated by an influx of black immigrants during the Great Migration and World War II. The decaying neighborhoods also developed sanitation problems; garbage pickups were rare and trash littered the street, accelerating the spread of diseases and enticing pests.<ref name=\":0\" /> Perceptions of \u201curban blight\u201d and a need for \u201cslum clearance\u201d in these areas were fueled especially by (majority white) Detroit city planners, who classified over two-thirds of housing in Paradise Valley as substandard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA plan for \u201curban renewal\u201d in Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods was put forth by Detroit Mayor Edward Jeffries in 1944. Utilizing eminent domain laws, the government began taking down buildings in the Black Bottom neighborhood in 1949.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganradio.org/post/how-razing-detroit-s-black-bottom-neighborhood-shaped-michigan-s-history|title=How the razing of Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood shaped Michigan's history|last=Staff|first=Stateside|website=www.michiganradio.org|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> The push for urban renewal in post-World War II Detroit was popularized by local government officials, in conjunction with real estate agents and bank owners of the time, who stood to gain from investment in new buildings and wealthier residents. When the 1956 Highway Act mandated new highways routed through Detroit, the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley areas were an ideal placement; deconstruction of the site had already been started, and the political clout of slum clearance was more powerful than the limited ability residents had to advocate against the placement.\n\nThough it faced urban poverty and overcrowding, the Black Bottom neighborhoods were an exciting mix of culture and innovation, with the economic district boasting approximately 350 black-owned businesses.<ref name=\":3\" /> The downtown area is often described as if Motown music played even from the pipes in the street. But when highway projects were announced, sometimes years before construction started and sometimes warning only thirty days in advance, the property values for those who did own land disappeared.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|date=December 1998|title=Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=47|doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1718|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> The forced relocation condemned many residents to even harsher poverty, and the local government commissions made few efforts to assist families in relocation. It was difficult enough for the thousands of persons displaced to find new housing in a time where restrictive covenants, even though technically outlawed in 1948, were deftly and covertly written into many of Detroit\u2019s surrounding neighborhoods. It was even harder for business owners to relocate their life\u2019s work. Lasting ramifications of the highway construction are still felt by the black business sector in Detroit today.\n\nThe Oakland-Hastings Freeway, now called the I-375 Chrysler Highway, was laid directly along Hastings Street at the heart of the Black Bottom business district, and cut through the Lower East Side and Paradise Valley as well.<ref name=\":4\" /> For the construction of the Edsel Ford Expressway (I-94) alone, 2,800 buildings from the West Side and northern Paradise Valley were demolished, including former jazz nightclubs, churches, community buildings, businesses and homes. The Lower West Side was mostly destroyed by the John C. Lodge Freeway, which also ran through black neighborhoods outside of Twelfth Street and Highland Park.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhat was once a diverse, thriving home to thousands of people quickly became a monument to the misguided and racist views of the city officials and planners of Detroit at the time. The highways catalyzed the decline of Detroit. Although planners envisioned them as necessary for a grander future Detroit, even when they were constructed the size of the roads were superfluous and better fit for a city with twice the population of Detroit. It created a second housing crisis and further encouraged residents to move out of the city and commute downtown to work, both of which drained money from Detroit\u2019s inner city. The highways reinforced the Motor City as just that: a place rumbling with engines from nine to five, but quieter and more deserted than it ever had been when the work day ended.\n\nA letter from a Mrs. Grace Black found in the Bentley Historical Library's historical archives illustrates the struggles of finding housing with children in the midst of highway construction:<blockquote>Sept 1950</blockquote><blockquote>Governor Williams:</blockquote><blockquote>Please consider a family of 6 who are desperately in need of a house to rent. Husband, wife, and four lonely children, who have been turned down because we have children. We are now living in a house of the Edsel Ford Express Highway. We have our notice to move on out before the 23rd of Oct. So far we haven't found a place to move. Nobody want to rent us because we have children. My children aren't destructive but nobody will give us a chance to find out if they are or not. We are so comfortable here. It's the first freedom we've enjoyed since we've had children. My husband work at children's hospital only mak $60 a week. Sixty dollars we are paying $50 a month which we don't mind because we are comfortable. This will be demolished if we were able we would buy this house. But are not. So if anything you can do will be appreciated from the depths of our hearts. You have done so much to help the lower income families. We are deeply grateful wishing you God's speed. This is urgent! Please give this your immediate consideration.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you</blockquote><blockquote>Mrs. Grace Black (a worried mother)</blockquote>\n\nI-75, Ford Field, and Comerica Park now occupy most of the area where Paradise Valley once stood. Historian [[Thomas Sugrue]] notes that of the families displaced by the razing of the Paradise Valley neighborhood:\n\n{{quote|[A]bout one-third of the Gratiot-area\u2019s families eventually moved to public housing, but 35 percent of the families in the area could not be traced.

The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterward, it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion, the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand.

A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Young, \"a vision from hell.\" During the height of the drug era, Detroit residents routinely set fire to houses that were known as popular [[crack house|drug-dealing locations]], accusing the city's police of being either unwilling or unable to solve the deep problems of the city.<ref>Coleman Young and Lonnie Wheeler, ''Hard Stuff: The Autobiography of Mayor Coleman Young'' (1994) p 282</ref>\n\nThe arson primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly destructive throughout this period. Over 800 fires were set, mostly to vacant houses, in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city's fire department. In later years, the arsons continued, but the frequency of these fires was reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses, buildings that were, in many cases, used to sell drugs. 5,000 of these buildings were razed in 1989\u201390 alone. Every year the city mobilizes \"Angel's Night,\" with tens of thousands of volunteers patrolling high-risk areas in the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Rogers|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stWZ_UDteMIC&pg=PA100|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=98\u2013102|isbn=9780195168969}}</ref><ref>Zev Chafets, ''Devil's Night and Other True Tales of Detroit'' (1990) ch 1</ref>\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Urban decay===\n[[File:Percent of Vacant Housing Units by Census Tract in Wayne County, MI (2011).svg|right|upright=1.5|thumb|This map shows vacancy rates of housing units in Wayne County, Michigan, and also in the city of Detroit.]]\n\nDetroit has been described by some as a [[ghost town]].<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite news|last=Brook|first=Pete|title=Captivating Photos of Detroit Delve Deep to Reveal a Beautiful, Struggling City|url=https://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/01/detroit-dave-jordano/|newspaper=Wired|date=2012-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\"couriermail\" /> Parts of the city are so abandoned they have been described as looking like farmland, [[urban prairie]], and even complete wilderness.<ref name=\"harpers\">{{cite magazine |last=Eagleton |first=Terry |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2007/07/detroit-arcadia |title=Detroit Arcadia |magazine=[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]] |date=July 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 }} -

Most notably, Dan Gilbert has heavily invested in the acquisition and revitalization of a number of historic buildings in the Downtown area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2018/05/02/dan-gilbert-chris-ilitch-panel-detroit-real-estate/34479969/|title=Gilbert, Ilitch pitch Detroit to real estate convention|work=Detroit News|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> A primary focus of private real estate investment has been to position Detroit's Central Business District as an attractive site for the investment of technology companies. Approaches to the private investment of Midtown, however, have prioritized re-establishing Midtown as the cultural and commercial center of the city. Public transportation within the Downtown area has also been a target for private investors, as evidenced by Quicken Loans' investment in Detroit's [[QLine]] railcar, which currently runs a {{convert|3.3|mi}} track along Woodward Avenue.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Shawn D | title = Amid Detroit area transit debate, cue the QLine | newspaper = [[The Detroit News]] | date = 2017-05-11 | url = https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/05/11/amid-detroit-area-transit-debate-cue-qline/101534214/\n | access-date = 2019-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the approach taken by many private investors in the downtown area has been met with several criticisms. Many have argued that the influx of private capital into the Downtown area has resulted in dramatic changes to the social and socio-economic character of the city. Residents have cited fears of physical displacement due to the increase in rent that results from such investments.<ref name=\":1\">Williams, Michael. \u201cListening to Detroit: Perspective on Gentrification in the Motor City.\u201d ''University of Michigan'', 2013.</ref> Additionally, many long-time residents fear that the influx of new capital could result in their political disempowerment; they fear that the city government will become less responsive to their needs if the city government is under the influence of outside investors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther investors, such as John Hantz, are attempting to revitalize Detroit using through another approach: urban agriculture. Unlike Gilbert, Hantz has turned his focus to the blighted neighborhoods in Detroit's residential zones. In 2008, Hantz approached Detroit's city government to propose a plan to remove urban blight by demolishing blighted homes and planting trees to establish a large urban farm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hantzfarmsdetroit.com/whatwehavedone.html|title=What We Have Done {{!}} Hantz Woodlands|website=www.hantzfarmsdetroit.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> Despite fervent criticisms on behalf of city residents claiming that Hantz's proposal amounted to nothing more than a \"land grab,\" the city government eventually approved Hantz's proposal, granting him nearly {{convert|140|acres}} of land. As of 2017, Hantz farms has planted over 24,000 saplings and demolished 62 blighted structures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wxyz.com/news/hantz-farms-seeing-new-success-with-urban-farming-in-detroit|title=Hantz Farms seeing new success with urban farming in Detroit|last=Smith|first=Matthew|date=2017-06-30|work=WXYZ|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> Still, it remains uncertain what Hantz's long-term ambitions are for the project, and many residents speculate future developments on his land.\n\nDetroit's resurgence is also being driven by the formation of public-private-nonprofit partnerships that protect and maintain Detroit's most valuable assets. The [[Detroit Riverfront]], for instance, is maintained and developed almost exclusively through non-profit funding in partnership with public and private enterprises. This model for economic development and revitalization has seen enormous success in Detroit, with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy raising in excess of $23 million to revitalize and maintain riverfront assets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://detroitriverfront.org/news/detroit-riverfront-conservancy-exceeds-capital-campaign-goal-23-million-and-celebrates|title=The Detroit RiverFront Conservancy Exceeds Capital Campaign Goal by $23 Million and Celebrates Transformation of the East Riverfront {{!}} Detroit Riverfront Conservancy|website=detroitriverfront.org|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> This model for economic development is so promising that the city has turned to similar partnership strategies to manage, maintain, and revitalize a number of other city assets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n* [[History of Detroit]]\n* [[Timeline of Detroit]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Deindustrialization]]\n*[[Public housing in Detroit|Housing conditions in Detroit City]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Doucet, Brian. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/feb/17/detroit-gentrification-poverty-public-services-race-divide Detroit's gentrification won't give poor citizens reliable public services]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WPrz2djV?url=http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/feb/17/detroit-gentrification-poverty-public-services-race-divide Archive]).
