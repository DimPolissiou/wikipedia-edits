By the end of the year neither side had succeeded in gaining an advantage, although the King's advance on London was the closest [[Royalist]] forces came to threatening the city.\n\n==Campaign of 1642==\nWhen the King raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642, war was already in progress on a small scale in many districts; each side endeavouring to secure, or to deny to the enemy, fortified country-houses, territory, and above all arms and money. Peace negotiations went on in the midst of these minor events, until there came from the Parliament an ultimatum, so aggressive as to fix the war-like purpose of the still vacillating court at Nottingham, and in the country at large, to convert many thousands of waverers to active Royalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nEre long, Charles who hitherto had fewer than 1,500 men, was at the head of an army which, though very deficient in arms and equipment, was not greatly inferior in numbers or enthusiasm to that of Parliament. The latter (20,000 strong, exclusive of [[Detachment (military)|detachments]]) was organized during July, August, and September about [[London]], and moved from there to [[Northampton]] under the command of Lord Essex.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nAt this moment, the military situation was as follows: the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] in [[South Wales]], Hopton in Cornwall, and the young Earl of Derby in [[Lancashire]], and small parties in almost every county of the west and the Midlands, were in arms for the King. North of the [[River Tees|Tees]], Newcastle, a great territorial magnate, was raising troops and supplies for the King, while [[Queen Henrietta Maria]] was busy in [[Holland]], arranging for the importation of war material and money. In [[Yorkshire]], opinion was divided, the royal cause being strongest in [[York]] and the [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding]], that of the Parliamentary party, in the clothing towns of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nThe important seaport of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], had a royalist civilian population, but Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor, and the garrison supported Parliament. During the summer Charles had tried to seize ammunitions stored in the city but had been [[siege of Hull (1642)|forcefully rebuffed]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nThe Yorkshire gentry made an attempt to neutralise the county, but a local struggle soon began, and Newcastle thereupon prepared to invade Yorkshire. The whole of the south and east, as well as parts of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the west, and the important towns of [[Bristol]] and [[Gloucester]], were on the side of the Parliament. A small Royalist force was compelled to evacuate [[Oxford]] on 10 September.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nOn 13 September, the main campaign opened. The King, in order to find recruits amongst his sympathisers and arms in the [[Armory (military)|armouries]] of the [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], trained bands and also, to be in touch with his disciplined regiments in Ireland by way of [[Chester]], moved westward to [[Shrewsbury]]. Essex followed suit by marching his army from Northampton to [[Worcester]]. Near here, a sharp cavalry engagement, [[battle of Powick Bridge|Powick Bridge]], took place on 23 September between the advanced cavalry of Essex's army, and a force under Prince Rupert, which was engaged in protecting the retirement of the Oxford detachment. The result of the fight was the immediate overthrow of the Parliamentary cavalry, and this gave the Royalist troopers a confidence in themselves and in their brilliant leader, which was not shaken until they met [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nRupert soon withdrew to Shrewsbury, where he found many Royalist officers eager to attack Essex's new position at Worcester. But the road to London now lay open and it was decided to take it. The intention was not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way\". Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east via [[Bridgnorth]], [[Birmingham]], and [[Kenilworth]]. This had the desired effect.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nParliament, alarmed for its own safety, sent repeated orders to Essex to find the King and bring him to battle. Alarm gave place to determination, when it was discovered that Charles was enlisting [[papist]]s and seeking foreign aid. The militia of the home counties was called out. A second army under Warwick was formed round the nucleus of the London trained bands, and Essex, straining every nerve to regain touch with the enemy, reached [[Kineton]], where he was only seven miles (eleven kilometres) from the King's headquarters at [[Edgecote]], on 22 October.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\n==Battle of Edgehill==\n{{main article|Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nRupert promptly reported the enemy's presence, and his confidence dominated the irresolution of the King, and the caution of the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], the nominal [[Commander-in-Chief]]. Both sides had marched, widely dispersed in order to live, and the rapidity with which, having the clearer purpose, the Royalists drew together, helped considerably to neutralise Essex's superior numbers.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nDuring the morning of 23 October 1642, the Royalists formed in battle order on the brow of [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]], facing towards Kineton. Essex, experienced soldier as he was, had distrusted his own raw army too much to force a decision earlier in the month, when the King was weak; he now found Charles in a strong position with an equal force to his own 14,000, and some of his regiments were still some miles distant. But he advanced beyond Kineton, and the enemy promptly left their strong position and came down to the foot of the hill; situated as they were, they had either to fight wherever they could induce the enemy to engage, or to starve in the midst of hostile [[garrison]]s.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nRupert was on the right of the King's army with the greater part of the horse; Lord Lindsey and Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] in the centre with the foot, while [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot, Earl of Rochester]] (with whom rode the [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Earl of Forth]], the principal military adviser of the King) with a smaller body of cavalry, was on the left. In rear of the centre were the King and a small reserve. Essex's order was similar. Rupert charged as soon as his wing was deployed, and before the infantry of either side were ready. Taking ground to his right front and then wheeling inwards at full speed, he instantly rode down the Parliamentary horse, opposed to him. Some infantry regiments of Essex's left centre shared the same fate as their cavalry.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOn the other wing, Forth and Wilmot likewise swept away all that they could see of the enemy's cavalry. The undisciplined Royalists of both wings pursued the fugitives in wild disorder up to Kineton, where they were severely handled by [[John Hampden|John Hampden's]] infantry [[brigade]] (which was escorting the artillery and baggage of Essex's army). Rupert brought back only a few rallied [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s to the battlefield, and in the meantime, affairs there had gone badly for the King.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nThe right and centre of the Parliamentary foot (the left having been brought to a halt by Rupert's charge) advanced with great resolution. Being at least as ardent as, and much better armed than Lindsey's men, they engaged the latter fiercely and slowly gained ground. Only the best regiments on either side, however, maintained their order, and the decision of the infantry battle was achieved mainly by a few Parliamentary squadrons.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOne regiment of Essex's right wing had been the target of Wilmot's charge. The other two had been at the moment, invisible, and every Royalist troop on the ground, including the King's guards, joined in the mad ride to Kineton. This regiment, Essex's life-guard, and some troops that had rallied from the effect of Rupert's charge (amongst them, Captain Oliver Cromwell's), were the only cavalry still present. They now joined with decisive effect in the attack on the left of the royal infantry.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nThe King's line was steadily rolled up from left to right. The Parliamentary troopers captured his guns, and regiment after regiment broke up. Charles himself stood calmly in the thick of the fight, but he had not the skill to direct it. The Royal Standard was taken and retaken; Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]], the standard-bearer, was killed as was Lindsey in a separate [[mel\u00e9e]]. By the time that Rupert returned, both sides were incapable of further effort and disillusioned as to the prospect of ending the war at a blow, so far from settling the issue the [[Battle of Edgehill]] was to be the first of a series of pitched battles.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOn 24 October Essex retired, leaving Charles to claim victory and to reap its results. [[Banbury]] and Oxford were reoccupied by the Royalists, and by 28 October, Charles was marching down the [[Thames]] valley on London. Negotiations were reopened, and a peace party rapidly formed itself in London and [[Westminster]]. Yet, field fortifications sprang up around London, and when Rupert [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|stormed Brentford]] and sacked it on 12 November, the [[trained band]]s moved out at once and took up a position at [[Turnham Green]], barring the King's advance.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nHampden, with something of the fire and energy of his cousin, Cromwell, urged Essex to turn both flanks of the Royal army via [[Acton, London|Acton]] and [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]]; experienced professional soldiers, however, urged him not to trust the London men to hold their ground, while the rest manoeuvred. Hampden's advice was undoubtedly premature. A [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]] or Worcester was not within the power of the Parliamentarians of 1642. In [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s words: \"one only manoeuvres around a fixed point\", and the city levies at that time were certainly not, ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' Rupert's cavalry, a fixed point.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nAs a matter of fact, after a slight cannonade at the [[Battle of Turnham Green]] on 13 November, Essex's two-to-one numerical superiority of itself compelled the King to retire to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Turnham Green has justly been called the \"Valmy of the English Civil War\"; for like the [[Battle of Valmy]] it was a victory without having to come to battle, and the tide of invasion having reached this far, ebbed and never returned.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\n==The winter of 1642\u201343==\nIn the winter, while Essex's army lay inactive at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Charles by degrees consolidated his position in the region of Oxford. The city was fortified as a [[redoubt]] for the whole area, and Reading, [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]], Banbury and [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] constituted a complete defensive ring which was developed by the creation of smaller posts from time to time.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nIn the North and West, winter campaigns were actively carried on: \"It is summer in Yorkshire, summer in [[Devon]], and cold winter at Windsor\", said one of Essex's critics. At the beginning of December 1642, Newcastle crossed the [[River Tees]], defeated Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the Parliamentary commander in the North Riding. He then joined hands with the hard-pressed Royalists at York, establishing himself between that city and [[Pontefract]]. [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] and his son Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], who commanded for the Parliament in Yorkshire, had to retire to the district between [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Selby]], and Newcastle was now free to turn his attention to the Puritan \"clothing towns\" of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]], [[Leeds]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and [[Bradford]]. The townsmen, however, showed a determined front. Sir Thomas Fairfax with a picked body of cavalry rode through Newcastle's lines into the West Riding to help them, and about the end of January 1643, Newcastle gave up the attempt to reduce the towns.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nNewcastle continued his march southward, however, and gained ground for the King as far as [[Newark-on-Trent]], so as to be in touch with the Royalists of [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Leicestershire]] (who, especially about Newark and [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], were strong enough to neutralise the local forces of Parliament), and to prepare the way for the further advance of the army of the north, when the Queen's [[convoy]] should arrive from overseas.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nIn the west, Hopton and his friends, having obtained a true bill from the grand jury against the Parliamentary disturbers of the peace, placed themselves at the head of the county militia. They drove the rebels from Cornwall, after which they raised a small force for general service and invaded Devonshire in November 1642. Subsequently, a Parliamentary army under the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] was withdrawn from South Wales to engage Hopton, who had to retire into Cornwall. There, however, the Royalist general was free to employ the militia again, and thus reinforced, he won a victory over a part of Stamford's forces at the [[Battle of Bradock Down]] near [[Liskeard]] on 19 January 1643 and resumed the offensive.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAbout the same time, Hertford, no longer opposed by Stamford, brought over the South Wales Royalists to Oxford. The fortified area around that place was widened by the capture of [[Cirencester]] on 2 February. [[Gloucester]] and [[Bristol]] were now the only important garrisons of the [[Roundhead]]s in the west. In the Midlands, in spite of a Parliamentary victory won by Sir [[William Brereton (Sir)|William Brereton]] at the [[Battle of Nantwich]] on 28 January, the Royalists of [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], and Leicestershire soon extended their influence through Ashby-de-la-Zouch into Nottinghamshire and joined hands with their friends at Newark.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAround Chester, a new Royalist army was being formed under the [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], and all the efforts of [[Sir John Brereton]] and of [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet]], the leading supporter of Parliament in Derbyshire, were required to hold their own, even before Newcastle's army was added to the list of their enemies. The [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]], who commanded for Parliament in [[Warwickshire]] and Staffordshire and was looked on by many as Essex's eventual successor, was killed in besieging [[Lichfield Cathedral]] on 2 March, and, though the cathedral soon capitulated, Gell and Brereton were severely handled in the indecisive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]] near [[Stafford]] on 19 March, and Prince Rupert, after an abortive raid on [[Bristol]] (7 March), marched rapidly northward, storming [[Birmingham]] en route, and recaptured Lichfield Cathedral. He was, however, soon recalled to Oxford to take part in the main campaign.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nThe position of affairs for Parliament was perhaps at its worst in January. The Royalist successes of November and December, the ever-present dread of foreign intervention, and the burden of new taxation which Parliament now found itself compelled to impose, disheartened its supporters. Disorders broke out in London, and, while the more determined of the rebels began thus early to think of calling in the military assistance of the Scots, the majority were for peace on any conditions.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nBut soon the position improved somewhat; the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] in the west and Brereton and Gell in the Midlands, though hard pressed, were at any rate in arms and undefeated, Newcastle had failed to conquer West Riding, and Sir [[William Waller]], who had cleared Hampshire and [[Wiltshire]] of \"malignants\", entered Gloucestershire early in March, destroyed a small Royalist force at [[Highnam]] on 24 March, and secured Bristol and Gloucester for Parliament.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nFinally, some of Charles's own intrigues opportunely came to light. The waverers, seeing the impossibility of plain dealing with the court, rallied again to the party of resistance. The series of negotiations called by the name of the \"[[Treaty of Oxford]]\" closed in April, with no more result than those which had preceded Edgehill and Turnham Green.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAbout this time too, following and improving upon the example of Newcastle in the north, Parliament ordered the formation of the celebrated \"associations\" or groups of counties, banded together by mutual consent for defence. The most powerful and best organised of these was that of the eastern counties (headquartered in [[Cambridge]]), where the danger of attack from the north was near enough to induce great energy in the preparations for meeting it, and at the same time, too distant effectively to interfere with these preparations. Above all, the [[Eastern Association]] was from the first, guided and inspired by Colonel Cromwell.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nThe field fortifications that were hastily thrown up during the summer of 1642 to defend London, were supplemented with the [[Lines of Communication (London)|Lines of Communication]] (the name given for new ring of fortifications around the City of London and the outer boroughs) that were commissioned by Parliament in 1642 and completed in 1643.{{sfn|Flintham |2008|loc=Civil War fortifications of London}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation|first=David |last=Flintham |url=http://www.fortified-places.com/london/ |title=Civil War fortifications of London |publisher=[http://www.fortified-places.com Fortified Places] |date=18 August 2008}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|first=Charles Francis |last=Atkinson |wstitle=Great Rebellion |volume=12 |pages=403\u2013421}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|1642||[[First English Civil War]]||[[First English Civil War, 1643|1643 \u2192]]\n|}\n\n[[Category:First English Civil War|1642]]\n[[Category:1642 in England|Civil War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1642]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|First English Civil War|First English Civil War, 1643|First English Civil War, 1644|First English Civil War, 1645|First English Civil War, 1646}}\n{{Campaignbox First English Civil War}}\nThe [[First English Civil War]] started in 1642.

A small Royalist force was compelled to evacuate [[Oxford]] on 10 September.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nOn 13 September, the main campaign opened. The King, in order to find recruits amongst his sympathisers and arms in the [[Armory (military)|armouries]] of the [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], trained bands and also, to be in touch with his disciplined regiments in Ireland by way of [[Chester]], moved westward to [[Shrewsbury]]. Essex followed suit by marching his army from Northampton to [[Worcester]]. Near here, a sharp cavalry engagement, [[battle of Powick Bridge|Powick Bridge]], took place on 23 September between the advanced cavalry of Essex's army, and a force under Prince Rupert, which was engaged in protecting the retirement of the Oxford detachment. The result of the fight was the immediate overthrow of the Parliamentary cavalry, and this gave the Royalist troopers a confidence in themselves and in their brilliant leader, which was not shaken until they met [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nRupert soon withdrew to Shrewsbury, where he found many Royalist officers eager to attack Essex's new position at Worcester. But the road to London now lay open and it was decided to take it. The intention was not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way\". Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east via [[Bridgnorth]], [[Birmingham]], and [[Kenilworth]]. This had the desired effect.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\nParliament, alarmed for its own safety, sent repeated orders to Essex to find the King and bring him to battle. Alarm gave place to determination, when it was discovered that Charles was enlisting [[papist]]s and seeking foreign aid. The militia of the home counties was called out. A second army under Warwick was formed round the nucleus of the London trained bands, and Essex, straining every nerve to regain touch with the enemy, reached [[Kineton]], where he was only seven miles (eleven kilometres) from the King's headquarters at [[Edgecote]], on 22 October.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=3. Campaign of 1642}}\n\n==Battle of Edgehill==\n{{main article|Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nRupert promptly reported the enemy's presence, and his confidence dominated the irresolution of the King, and the caution of the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], the nominal [[Commander-in-Chief]]. Both sides had marched, widely dispersed in order to live, and the rapidity with which, having the clearer purpose, the Royalists drew together, helped considerably to neutralise Essex's superior numbers.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nDuring the morning of 23 October 1642, the Royalists formed in battle order on the brow of [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]], facing towards Kineton. Essex, experienced soldier as he was, had distrusted his own raw army too much to force a decision earlier in the month, when the King was weak; he now found Charles in a strong position with an equal force to his own 14,000, and some of his regiments were still some miles distant. But he advanced beyond Kineton, and the enemy promptly left their strong position and came down to the foot of the hill; situated as they were, they had either to fight wherever they could induce the enemy to engage, or to starve in the midst of hostile [[garrison]]s.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nRupert was on the right of the King's army with the greater part of the horse; Lord Lindsey and Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] in the centre with the foot, while [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot, Earl of Rochester]] (with whom rode the [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Earl of Forth]], the principal military adviser of the King) with a smaller body of cavalry, was on the left. In rear of the centre were the King and a small reserve. Essex's order was similar. Rupert charged as soon as his wing was deployed, and before the infantry of either side were ready. Taking ground to his right front and then wheeling inwards at full speed, he instantly rode down the Parliamentary horse, opposed to him. Some infantry regiments of Essex's left centre shared the same fate as their cavalry.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOn the other wing, Forth and Wilmot likewise swept away all that they could see of the enemy's cavalry. The undisciplined Royalists of both wings pursued the fugitives in wild disorder up to Kineton, where they were severely handled by [[John Hampden|John Hampden's]] infantry [[brigade]] (which was escorting the artillery and baggage of Essex's army). Rupert brought back only a few rallied [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s to the battlefield, and in the meantime, affairs there had gone badly for the King.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nThe right and centre of the Parliamentary foot (the left having been brought to a halt by Rupert's charge) advanced with great resolution. Being at least as ardent as, and much better armed than Lindsey's men, they engaged the latter fiercely and slowly gained ground. Only the best regiments on either side, however, maintained their order, and the decision of the infantry battle was achieved mainly by a few Parliamentary squadrons.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOne regiment of Essex's right wing had been the target of Wilmot's charge. The other two had been at the moment, invisible, and every Royalist troop on the ground, including the King's guards, joined in the mad ride to Kineton. This regiment, Essex's life-guard, and some troops that had rallied from the effect of Rupert's charge (amongst them, Captain Oliver Cromwell's), were the only cavalry still present. They now joined with decisive effect in the attack on the left of the royal infantry.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nThe King's line was steadily rolled up from left to right. The Parliamentary troopers captured his guns, and regiment after regiment broke up. Charles himself stood calmly in the thick of the fight, but he had not the skill to direct it. The Royal Standard was taken and retaken; Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]], the standard-bearer, was killed as was Lindsey in a separate [[mel\u00e9e]]. By the time that Rupert returned, both sides were incapable of further effort and disillusioned as to the prospect of ending the war at a blow, so far from settling the issue the [[Battle of Edgehill]] was to be the first of a series of pitched battles.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nOn 24 October Essex retired, leaving Charles to claim victory and to reap its results. [[Banbury]] and Oxford were reoccupied by the Royalists, and by 28 October, Charles was marching down the [[Thames]] valley on London. Negotiations were reopened, and a peace party rapidly formed itself in London and [[Westminster]]. Yet, field fortifications sprang up around London, and when Rupert [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|stormed Brentford]] and sacked it on 12 November, the [[trained band]]s moved out at once and took up a position at [[Turnham Green]], barring the King's advance.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nHampden, with something of the fire and energy of his cousin, Cromwell, urged Essex to turn both flanks of the Royal army via [[Acton, London|Acton]] and [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]]; experienced professional soldiers, however, urged him not to trust the London men to hold their ground, while the rest manoeuvred. Hampden's advice was undoubtedly premature. A [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]] or Worcester was not within the power of the Parliamentarians of 1642. In [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s words: \"one only manoeuvres around a fixed point\", and the city levies at that time were certainly not, ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' Rupert's cavalry, a fixed point.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\nAs a matter of fact, after a slight cannonade at the [[Battle of Turnham Green]] on 13 November, Essex's two-to-one numerical superiority of itself compelled the King to retire to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Turnham Green has justly been called the \"Valmy of the English Civil War\"; for like the [[Battle of Valmy]] it was a victory without having to come to battle, and the tide of invasion having reached this far, ebbed and never returned.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=4. Battle of Edgehill}}\n\n==The winter of 1642\u201343==\nIn the winter, while Essex's army lay inactive at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Charles by degrees consolidated his position in the region of Oxford. The city was fortified as a [[redoubt]] for the whole area, and Reading, [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]], Banbury and [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] constituted a complete defensive ring which was developed by the creation of smaller posts from time to time.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nIn the North and West, winter campaigns were actively carried on: \"It is summer in Yorkshire, summer in [[Devon]], and cold winter at Windsor\", said one of Essex's critics. At the beginning of December 1642, Newcastle crossed the [[River Tees]], defeated Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the Parliamentary commander in the North Riding. He then joined hands with the hard-pressed Royalists at York, establishing himself between that city and [[Pontefract]]. [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] and his son Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], who commanded for the Parliament in Yorkshire, had to retire to the district between [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Selby]], and Newcastle was now free to turn his attention to the Puritan \"clothing towns\" of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]], [[Leeds]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and [[Bradford]]. The townsmen, however, showed a determined front. Sir Thomas Fairfax with a picked body of cavalry rode through Newcastle's lines into the West Riding to help them, and about the end of January 1643, Newcastle gave up the attempt to reduce the towns.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nNewcastle continued his march southward, however, and gained ground for the King as far as [[Newark-on-Trent]], so as to be in touch with the Royalists of [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Leicestershire]] (who, especially about Newark and [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], were strong enough to neutralise the local forces of Parliament), and to prepare the way for the further advance of the army of the north, when the Queen's [[convoy]] should arrive from overseas.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nIn the west, Hopton and his friends, having obtained a true bill from the grand jury against the Parliamentary disturbers of the peace, placed themselves at the head of the county militia. They drove the rebels from Cornwall, after which they raised a small force for general service and invaded Devonshire in November 1642. Subsequently, a Parliamentary army under the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] was withdrawn from South Wales to engage Hopton, who had to retire into Cornwall. There, however, the Royalist general was free to employ the militia again, and thus reinforced, he won a victory over a part of Stamford's forces at the [[Battle of Bradock Down]] near [[Liskeard]] on 19 January 1643 and resumed the offensive.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAbout the same time, Hertford, no longer opposed by Stamford, brought over the South Wales Royalists to Oxford. The fortified area around that place was widened by the capture of [[Cirencester]] on 2 February. [[Gloucester]] and [[Bristol]] were now the only important garrisons of the [[Roundhead]]s in the west. In the Midlands, in spite of a Parliamentary victory won by Sir [[William Brereton (Sir)|William Brereton]] at the [[Battle of Nantwich]] on 28 January, the Royalists of [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], and Leicestershire soon extended their influence through Ashby-de-la-Zouch into Nottinghamshire and joined hands with their friends at Newark.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAround Chester, a new Royalist army was being formed under the [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], and all the efforts of [[Sir John Brereton]] and of [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet]], the leading supporter of Parliament in Derbyshire, were required to hold their own, even before Newcastle's army was added to the list of their enemies. The [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]], who commanded for Parliament in [[Warwickshire]] and Staffordshire and was looked on by many as Essex's eventual successor, was killed in besieging [[Lichfield Cathedral]] on 2 March, and, though the cathedral soon capitulated, Gell and Brereton were severely handled in the indecisive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]] near [[Stafford]] on 19 March, and Prince Rupert, after an abortive raid on [[Bristol]] (7 March), marched rapidly northward, storming [[Birmingham]] en route, and recaptured Lichfield Cathedral. He was, however, soon recalled to Oxford to take part in the main campaign.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nThe position of affairs for Parliament was perhaps at its worst in January. The Royalist successes of November and December, the ever-present dread of foreign intervention, and the burden of new taxation which Parliament now found itself compelled to impose, disheartened its supporters. Disorders broke out in London, and, while the more determined of the rebels began thus early to think of calling in the military assistance of the Scots, the majority were for peace on any conditions.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nBut soon the position improved somewhat; the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]] in the west and Brereton and Gell in the Midlands, though hard pressed, were at any rate in arms and undefeated, Newcastle had failed to conquer West Riding, and Sir [[William Waller]], who had cleared Hampshire and [[Wiltshire]] of \"malignants\", entered Gloucestershire early in March, destroyed a small Royalist force at [[Highnam]] on 24 March, and secured Bristol and Gloucester for Parliament.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nFinally, some of Charles's own intrigues opportunely came to light. The waverers, seeing the impossibility of plain dealing with the court, rallied again to the party of resistance. The series of negotiations called by the name of the \"[[Treaty of Oxford]]\" closed in April, with no more result than those which had preceded Edgehill and Turnham Green.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nAbout this time too, following and improving upon the example of Newcastle in the north, Parliament ordered the formation of the celebrated \"associations\" or groups of counties, banded together by mutual consent for defence. The most powerful and best organised of these was that of the eastern counties (headquartered in [[Cambridge]]), where the danger of attack from the north was near enough to induce great energy in the preparations for meeting it, and at the same time, too distant effectively to interfere with these preparations. Above all, the [[Eastern Association]] was from the first, guided and inspired by Colonel Cromwell.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=5. The Winter of 1642-43}}\n\nThe field fortifications that were hastily thrown up during the summer of 1642 to defend London, were supplemented with the [[Lines of Communication (London)|Lines of Communication]] (the name given for new ring of fortifications around the City of London and the outer boroughs) that were commissioned by Parliament in 1642 and completed in 1643.{{sfn|Flintham |2008|loc=Civil War fortifications of London}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation|first=David |last=Flintham |url=http://www.fortified-places.com/london/ |title=Civil War fortifications of London |publisher=[http://www.fortified-places.com Fortified Places] |date=18 August 2008}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|first=Charles Francis |last=Atkinson |wstitle=Great Rebellion |volume=12 |pages=403\u2013421}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|1642||[[First English Civil War]]||[[First English Civil War, 1643|1643 \u2192]]\n|}\n\n[[Category:First English Civil War|1642]]\n[[Category:1642 in England|Civil War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1642]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTee (disambiguation)(link changed toRiver Tees) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War,_1642"}

He is a former journalist and editor.\n\nA prominent journalist, Pashinyan first founded his own newspaper in 1998 which was shut down a year later. He was sentenced for one year for defamation against then Minister of National Security [[Serzh Sargsyan]]. He edited ''Haykakan Zhamanak'' (Armenian Times) from 1999 to 2012. Sympathetic to  Armenia's first president [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], he was highly critical of second president [[Robert Kocharyan]], Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and their allied oligarchs. Pashinyan led a minor opposition party in the [[2007 Armenian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], garnering 1.3% of the vote. He was an outspoken supporter of Ter-Petrosyan, when the latter made a political comeback prior to the [[2008 Armenian presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Ter-Petrosyan was defeated by Serzh Sargsyan in an election marred with widespread vote fraud and violence. Noted for his fiery speeches, Pashinyan had a significant role in the [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|post-election protests]] which were violently put down by government forces on 1 March 2008 resulting in the deaths of 10 people. Pashinyan, blamed for \"organizing mass disorders,\" went into hiding, only to re-emerge in mid-2009. He was controversially sentenced to seven years in prison; a move that was widely seen as politically motivated. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general amnesty. He was [[2012 Armenian parliamentary election|elected]] to parliament from Ter-Petrosyan's broad opposition coalition, the [[Armenian National Congress]], in 2012.\n\nHe later broke from Ter-Petrosyan on political grounds, establishing the party [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]]. Along with two other opposition parties, Pashinyan formed the [[Way Out Alliance]] which garnered almost 8% of the vote in the [[2017 Armenian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]]. He was the leader of the [[2018 Armenian revolution]] which forced Prime Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]] and his government to resign. On 1 May 2018, he failed to gain enough votes from the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|Parliament]] to become the Prime Minister himself, but was elected in the second vote on 8 May.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/europe/armenia-new-prime-minister-nikol-pashinyan-intl/index.html|title=Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan elected prime minister|last=Vonberg|first=Judith|date=8 May 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nNikol Pashinyan was born on June 1, 1975 in [[Ijevan]], in the northeastern province of [[Tavush]].

Pashinyan led a minor opposition party in the [[2007 Armenian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], garnering 1.3% of the vote. He was an outspoken supporter of Ter-Petrosyan, when the latter made a political comeback prior to the [[2008 Armenian presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Ter-Petrosyan was defeated by Serzh Sargsyan in an election marred with widespread vote fraud and violence. Noted for his fiery speeches, Pashinyan had a significant role in the [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|post-election protests]] which were violently put down by government forces on 1 March 2008 resulting in the deaths of 10 people. Pashinyan, blamed for \"organizing mass disorders,\" went into hiding, only to re-emerge in mid-2009. He was controversially sentenced to seven years in prison; a move that was widely seen as politically motivated. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general amnesty. He was [[2012 Armenian parliamentary election|elected]] to parliament from Ter-Petrosyan's broad opposition coalition, the [[Armenian National Congress]], in 2012.\n\nHe later broke from Ter-Petrosyan on political grounds, establishing the party [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]]. Along with two other opposition parties, Pashinyan formed the [[Way Out Alliance]] which garnered almost 8% of the vote in the [[2017 Armenian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]]. He was the leader of the [[2018 Armenian revolution]] which forced Prime Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]] and his government to resign. On 1 May 2018, he failed to gain enough votes from the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|Parliament]] to become the Prime Minister himself, but was elected in the second vote on 8 May.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/europe/armenia-new-prime-minister-nikol-pashinyan-intl/index.html|title=Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan elected prime minister|last=Vonberg|first=Judith|date=8 May 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nNikol Pashinyan was born on June 1, 1975 in [[Ijevan]], in the northeastern province of [[Tavush]].

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The city is centred along the [[Brisbane River]], and its eastern suburbs line the shores of [[Moreton Bay]], a bay of the [[Coral Sea]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

At {{convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the [[cathedral city]] of [[Durham, England|Durham]] and gives its name to [[Weardale]] in its upper reach and [[Wearside]] by its mouth.\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin behind the [[Hydronym|hydronym]] ''Wear'' is uncertain but is generally understood to be Celtic. The ''River Vedra'' on the Roman Map of Britain may very well be the River Wear. The name may be derived from [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*wejr'' (<''*w\u1eb9:dr\u0101''),<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> which meant \"a bend\" (c.f [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''-gwair-'').<ref name=\"BLITON\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan G. |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence - Guide to the Elements |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=Scottish Place Name Society - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> An alternative but very problematic etymology might involve ''*w\u1eb9:d-r-'',<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> from a lengthened form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *wed- \"water\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brittonic root ''*wei-'', which is thought to have meant \"to flow\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> The name ''Wear'' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning \"river of blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=North East Place Name Meanings T to Y - England's North East|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/PlaceNameMeaningsTtoY.html|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the ''Wear'' has the same etymology as the [[River Wyre]] in [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> as well as the [[Quair Water]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"BLITON\" />\n\n==Geology==\nThe Wear rises in the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. Specifically, the Weardale Granite underlies the headwaters of the Wear. Devonian [[Old Red Sandstone]] in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop{{#tag:ref| i.e. appear on the surface|group= n}} but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geology: Granite in the North Pennines |url=http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/sites/oldrookhope/archive/40.html|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period.\n\nIt is thought that the course of the River Wear, prior to the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], was much as it is now as far as [[Chester-le-Street]]. This can be established as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to [[coal mining]]. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower [[River Team]]. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other [[Till|glacial till]]. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]]. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the [[River Browney]] was pushed from [[Gilesgate]] (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] ([[Croxdale]]). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial [[boulder clay]] was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the [[Permian]] [[Magnesian Limestone]] can be seen most clearly at Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at [[Hartlepool]].\n\nThe upland area of Upper Weardale retains a flora that relates, almost uniquely in [[England]], to the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], although it almost or entirely lacks the particular rarities that make up the unique \"Teesdale Assemblage\" of post-glacial plants. This may, in part, be due to the [[Pennines|Pennine]] areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the shrinking [[ice cap]]. The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral [[moraines]] and material from the [[Lake District]] and [[Northumberland]], although surprisingly few [[drumlins]]. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested, however during the [[Neolithic]] period and increasingly in the [[Bronze Age]], were largely [[deforestation|deforested]] for agriculture.\n\n==Industrial history==\nMuch of the River Wear is associated with the history of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The [[Weardale Railway]] continues to run occasional services between [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] and [[Wolsingham]].\n\nMining of [[lead ore]] has been known in the area of the headwaters of the Wear since the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen,{{where?|date=December 2012}} and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of [[gangue]] minerals in present mining, such as fluorspar for the smelting of [[aluminium]].  However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course.\n\n[[Fluorspar]] is another mineral sporadically co-present with Weardale Granite and became important in the manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the [[Wear Valley|Wear valley]], [[Consett]] and Teesside during the nineteenth century.  Overlying are three [[Carboniferous]] minerals: [[Carboniferous limestone|limestone]], [[Coal measure|Coal Measures]] as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and [[sandstone]], useful as a [[refractory material]]. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at [[Rogerley Quarry]], Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals.\n\nMinco are currently exploring the North Pennines and the upper Wear catchment for potential reserves of [[zinc]] at lower levels.\n\n[[Ironstone]] which was important as the ore was won from around [[Consett]] and [[Tow Law]], then around [[Rookhope]], while greater quantities were imported from just south of the southerly [[River Tees|Tees]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. These sources were in due course depleted or became uneconomic.\n\nThe former [[cement]] works at [[Eastgate, County Durham|Eastgate]], until recently run by [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], was based on an inlier of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a \"hot rocks\" water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near [[Westgate, County Durham|Westgate]] and operate a tarmac \"blacktop\" plant on site.\n\nMineral extraction has also occurred above [[St John's Chapel, County Durham|St John's Chapel]] with the extraction of [[ganister]] which was used in the steel process at Consett. Around [[Frosterley]], limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and [[Durham Cathedral]].\n\n==Course==\nRising in the east [[Pennines]], its head waters consisting of several streams draining from the hills between Killhope Law and [[Burnhope Seat]], the head of the river is held to be in [[Wearhead]], [[County Durham]] at the confluence of Burnhope Burn and Killhope Burn. This is shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and on the County Durham GIS online. However, a map produced by Durham County Council, and used on an interpretation board at Cowshill shows the River Wear taking in the northwest Killhope Burn from Wearhead up to Killhope. Excepting that this apparent extension of the Wear is an error, it can be assumed that there are attempts to reclassify Killhope Burn as the River Wear - on some analyses this practice of backtracking is common in the study of [[river]]s as it gives the River Wear an issue as the source instead of a [[confluence]], to which this article's [[River Wear#Geology and history|Geology]] relates. The River Wear is a spate river and has been heavily influenced by previous government funded drainage schemes (gripping) with a view to improving marginal agricultural land. The river rises very quickly and has experienced much heavy flooding resulting in enhanced river bank erosion\n\nThe river flows eastwards through [[Weardale]], one of the larger valleys of west [[County Durham]], subsequently turning south-east, and then north-east, meandering its way through the Wear Valley still in County Durham to the [[North Sea]] where it outfalls at Wearmouth in the main locality of [[Monkwearmouth]] on [[Wearside]] in the [[City of Sunderland]]. The {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} from head to mouth. Prior to the creation of [[Tyne and Wear]], the Wear had been the longest river in England with a course entirely within one county. The [[Weardale Way]], a long-distance public footpath, roughly follows the entire route, including the length of Killhope Burn.\n\n===Wearhead to Bishop Auckland===\n[[File:River Wear Weardale 20070617.jpg|thumb|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows from [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] to [[Frosterley]]]]\n\nThere are several towns, sights and tourist places along the length of the river. The market town of [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] is known in part for the ford across the river. From here the river is followed by the line of the [[Weardale Railway]], which crosses the river several times, through [[Frosterley]], [[Wolsingham]], and [[Witton-le-Wear]] to [[Bishop Auckland]].\n\n===Bishop Auckland to Durham===\nOn the edge of [[Bishop Auckland]] the Wear passes below Auckland Park and [[Auckland Castle]], the official residence of the [[Bishop of Durham]] and its [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. A mile or so downstream from here, the Wear passes [[Binchester Roman Fort]], [[Vinovia]], having been crossed by [[Dere Street]], the Roman road running from [[Eboracum]] (now [[York]]) to [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]] (now [[Corbridge]]) close to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile [[flood plain]]s and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] (near [[Croxdale]]), and [[Shincliffe]]. At Sunderland Bridge the [[River Browney]] joins the River Wear.\n\n===Durham===\n[[File:River wear at durham.jpg|thumb|left|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows through [[Durham, England|Durham]].]]\nWhen it reaches the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]] the River Wear passes through a deep, wooded gorge, from which several springs emerge, historically used as sources of [[potable water]]. A few coal seams are visible in the banks. Twisting sinuously in an incised [[meander]], the river has cut deeply into the \"Cathedral Sandstone\" bedrock. The high ground (bluffs) enclosed by this meander is known as the ''Peninsula'', forming a defensive enclosure, at whose heart lies [[Durham Castle]] and [[Durham Cathedral]] and which developed around [[the Bailey]] into Durham city. That area is now a UN [[World Heritage Site]].  Beneath [[Elvet Bridge]] are Brown's Boats (rowing boats for hire) and the mooring for the Prince Bishop, a pleasure cruiser.\n\nThe River Wear at Durham was featured on a television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of [[Northern England]].\n\nIn June each year, the [[Durham Regatta]], which predates that at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], attracts rowing crews from around the region for races along the river's course through the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Durham Regatta |url=http://www.durham-regatta.org.uk/|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> Seven smaller Regattas and Head Races are held throughout the rest of the year, which attract a lower number of competitors. There are 14 boathouses<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last       = Durham College Rowing\n |title      = Boat Clubs in Durham\n |accessdate = 2008-12-28\n |url        = http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120728162131/http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|url-status   = dead\n|archive-date = 2012-07-28\n}}\n</ref> and [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear#Durham|20 boat clubs]] based on the Wear in Durham.\n\nTwo weirs impede the flow of the river at Durham, both originally created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring [[sea trout]] and [[salmon]], and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).\n\nThe river's banks also lend their name to a [[hymn tune]] ''[[Elvet Banks]]'' in the 2006 hymnbook of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], used (appropriately) for a [[hymn]] for [[baptism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lutheran Music |url=http://www.lutheranmusic.com/library/LSB/pages/hymns/lsb407-midi.html|accessdate=2008-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Durham to Chester-le-Street===\n[[File:fichale.jpg|thumb|[[Finchale Priory]] on the banks of the River Wear between Durham City and Chester-le-Street. Note the wooden footbridge across the river on the right of the photograph.]]\nBetween Durham City and [[Chester-le-Street]], {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} due north, the River Wear changes direction repeatedly, flowing south westwards several miles downstream having passed the medieval site of [[Finchale Priory]], a former chapel and later a satellite monastery depending on the abbey church of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Two miles downstream, the river is flowing south eastwards. The only road bridge over the Wear between Durham and Chester-le-Street is Cocken Bridge. As it passes [[Chester-le-Street]], where the river is overlooked by [[Lumley Castle]], its flood plain has been developed into [[Riverside Ground|The Riverside]], the home pitch of [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. Passing through the Lambton Estate and near [[Lambton Castle]] the river becomes tidal, and navigable.\n\n===Chester-le-Street to Sunderland===\nOn exiting the Lambton estate the river leaves County Durham and enters the [[City of Sunderland]], specifically the southern/south-eastern edge of the new town of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. At [[Fatfield]] the river passes beneath [[Lambton Worm|Worm Hill]], around which the [[Lambton Worm]] is reputed to have curled its tail.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lambton Worm |work=The Legends and Myths of Britain |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611223547/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlready the riverbanks are showing evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries and chemical works. A little further downstream the river passes beneath the Victoria Viaduct, (formally called the Victoria Bridge). Named after the newly crowned queen, the railway viaduct opened in 1838, was the crowning achievement of the [[Leamside Line]], then carrying what was to become the [[East Coast Main Line]].  A mile to the east is [[Penshaw Monument]], a local iconic landmark. As the river leaves the environs of Washington, it forms the eastern boundary of [[WWT Washington|Washington Wildfowl Trust]].\n\n===Sunderland===\n[[File:St peters campus.jpg|thumb|left|As the river approaches its outfall into the North Sea, it flows past [[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]], [[University of Sunderland]].<br />''Shadows in Another Light'', a sculpture in which the shadow cast by a tree represents a hammerhead crane, unique to the Sunderland shipyards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice in Sunderland |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/alice.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> can be seen at the left of this image.]]\n\nHaving flowed beneath the [[A19 road|A19 trunk road]], the river enters the suburbs of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The riverbanks show further evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of [[shipyard]]s. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders were some of the most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist [[L. S. Lowry]] visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the industrial landscape around the river. Four bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] to the west, the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]], and the Wearmouth rail and [[Wearmouth Bridge|road]] bridges in the city centre.\n\nOn both banks at this point there are modern developments, some belonging to the [[University of Sunderland]] ([[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]]; Scotia Quay residences) and to the [[National Glass Centre]]. A riverside [[sculpture trail]] runs alongside this final section of its north bank.<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/sculpture.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project was created by Colin Wilbourn, with crime novelist and ex-poet [[Chaz Brenchley]].

A dolphin nicknamed Freddie was a frequent visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity.  However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk the safety of the dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft. The south bank of the river is occupied by what remains of the Port of Sunderland, once thriving and now almost gone.\n\nThe River Wear flows out of Sunderland between [[Roker]] Pier and South Pier, and into the [[North Sea]].\n{{clearleft}}\n== See also ==\n* [[List of crossings of the River Wear]]\n* [[List of rivers of England]]\n* [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear]]\n* [[Harry Watts]] \u2013 multiple River Wear life-saver\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge railway viaduct 20070630.jpg|[[Croxdale Viaduct]] carrying the [[East Coast Main Line]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge 20070630.jpg|[[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge (2) 20070630.JPG|Sunderland Bridge\nImage:River Wear Shincliffe Bridge 20070630.JPG|The 1826 stone bridge at [[Shincliffe]]\nImage:River Wear Maiden Castle Bridge 20070630.JPG|Maiden Castle footbridge\nImage:River Wear Baths Bridge 20070630.JPG|Baths Bridge \nImage:River Wear New Elvet Bridge 20070630.JPG|[[New Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Elvet Bridge (1) 20070630.JPG|[[Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Durham Kingsgate Bridge 20070630.jpg|looking towards [[Kingsgate Bridge]]\nImage:Dunelm-view.jpg|Kingsgate Bridge\nImage:River Wear Durham Prebends Bridge (1) 20011229.jpg|[[Prebends Bridge]]\nImage:Durham City 30c 20031207 Prebends Bridge 02a.jpg|Prebends Bridge\nImage:Durham City 35c 20030907 River Wear 01 upstream.jpg|[[Milburngate Bridge]] (foreground) and [[Framwellgate Bridge]] (background)\nImage:Durham City 20030907 Pennyfeather Bridge 03 (originals).JPG|[[Pennyferry Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070701 Cocken Bridge 01.jpg|[[Cocken Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Fatfield Bridge 01.jpg|[[Fatfield]] Bridge\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Victoria Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Victoria Viaduct]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Hylton Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Hylton Viaduct]]\nImage:Wearmouth bridge.jpg|[[Wearmouth Bridge]]\nImage:Roker Lighthouse - geograph.org.uk - 1095762.jpg|[[Roker]] Pier lighthouse, where the river meets the sea\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes \n{{Reflist|group=n}}  \n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Natural Environment Research Council]], Institute of Geological Sciences, 1971, \"British Regional Geology: Northern England\" Fourth Edition, HMSO, London.\n*Johnson, G.A.L. & Hickling, G.

The ''River Vedra'' on the Roman Map of Britain may very well be the River Wear. The name may be derived from [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*wejr'' (<''*w\u1eb9:dr\u0101''),<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> which meant \"a bend\" (c.f [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''-gwair-'').<ref name=\"BLITON\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan G. |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence - Guide to the Elements |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=Scottish Place Name Society - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> An alternative but very problematic etymology might involve ''*w\u1eb9:d-r-'',<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> from a lengthened form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *wed- \"water\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brittonic root ''*wei-'', which is thought to have meant \"to flow\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> The name ''Wear'' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning \"river of blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=North East Place Name Meanings T to Y - England's North East|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/PlaceNameMeaningsTtoY.html|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the ''Wear'' has the same etymology as the [[River Wyre]] in [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> as well as the [[Quair Water]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"BLITON\" />\n\n==Geology==\nThe Wear rises in the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. Specifically, the Weardale Granite underlies the headwaters of the Wear. Devonian [[Old Red Sandstone]] in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop{{#tag:ref| i.e. appear on the surface|group= n}} but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geology: Granite in the North Pennines |url=http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/sites/oldrookhope/archive/40.html|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period.\n\nIt is thought that the course of the River Wear, prior to the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], was much as it is now as far as [[Chester-le-Street]]. This can be established as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to [[coal mining]]. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower [[River Team]]. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other [[Till|glacial till]]. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]]. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the [[River Browney]] was pushed from [[Gilesgate]] (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] ([[Croxdale]]). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial [[boulder clay]] was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the [[Permian]] [[Magnesian Limestone]] can be seen most clearly at Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at [[Hartlepool]].\n\nThe upland area of Upper Weardale retains a flora that relates, almost uniquely in [[England]], to the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], although it almost or entirely lacks the particular rarities that make up the unique \"Teesdale Assemblage\" of post-glacial plants. This may, in part, be due to the [[Pennines|Pennine]] areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the shrinking [[ice cap]]. The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral [[moraines]] and material from the [[Lake District]] and [[Northumberland]], although surprisingly few [[drumlins]]. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested, however during the [[Neolithic]] period and increasingly in the [[Bronze Age]], were largely [[deforestation|deforested]] for agriculture.\n\n==Industrial history==\nMuch of the River Wear is associated with the history of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The [[Weardale Railway]] continues to run occasional services between [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] and [[Wolsingham]].\n\nMining of [[lead ore]] has been known in the area of the headwaters of the Wear since the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen,{{where?|date=December 2012}} and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of [[gangue]] minerals in present mining, such as fluorspar for the smelting of [[aluminium]].  However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course.\n\n[[Fluorspar]] is another mineral sporadically co-present with Weardale Granite and became important in the manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the [[Wear Valley|Wear valley]], [[Consett]] and Teesside during the nineteenth century.  Overlying are three [[Carboniferous]] minerals: [[Carboniferous limestone|limestone]], [[Coal measure|Coal Measures]] as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and [[sandstone]], useful as a [[refractory material]]. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at [[Rogerley Quarry]], Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals.\n\nMinco are currently exploring the North Pennines and the upper Wear catchment for potential reserves of [[zinc]] at lower levels.\n\n[[Ironstone]] which was important as the ore was won from around [[Consett]] and [[Tow Law]], then around [[Rookhope]], while greater quantities were imported from just south of the southerly [[Tees]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. These sources were in due course depleted or became uneconomic.\n\nThe former [[cement]] works at [[Eastgate, County Durham|Eastgate]], until recently run by [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], was based on an inlier of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a \"hot rocks\" water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near [[Westgate, County Durham|Westgate]] and operate a tarmac \"blacktop\" plant on site.\n\nMineral extraction has also occurred above [[St John's Chapel, County Durham|St John's Chapel]] with the extraction of [[ganister]] which was used in the steel process at Consett. Around [[Frosterley]], limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and [[Durham Cathedral]].\n\n==Course==\nRising in the east [[Pennines]], its head waters consisting of several streams draining from the hills between Killhope Law and [[Burnhope Seat]], the head of the river is held to be in [[Wearhead]], [[County Durham]] at the confluence of Burnhope Burn and Killhope Burn. This is shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and on the County Durham GIS online. However, a map produced by Durham County Council, and used on an interpretation board at Cowshill shows the River Wear taking in the northwest Killhope Burn from Wearhead up to Killhope. Excepting that this apparent extension of the Wear is an error, it can be assumed that there are attempts to reclassify Killhope Burn as the River Wear - on some analyses this practice of backtracking is common in the study of [[river]]s as it gives the River Wear an issue as the source instead of a [[confluence]], to which this article's [[River Wear#Geology and history|Geology]] relates. The River Wear is a spate river and has been heavily influenced by previous government funded drainage schemes (gripping) with a view to improving marginal agricultural land. The river rises very quickly and has experienced much heavy flooding resulting in enhanced river bank erosion\n\nThe river flows eastwards through [[Weardale]], one of the larger valleys of west [[County Durham]], subsequently turning south-east, and then north-east, meandering its way through the Wear Valley still in County Durham to the [[North Sea]] where it outfalls at Wearmouth in the main locality of [[Monkwearmouth]] on [[Wearside]] in the [[City of Sunderland]]. The {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} from head to mouth. Prior to the creation of [[Tyne and Wear]], the Wear had been the longest river in England with a course entirely within one county. The [[Weardale Way]], a long-distance public footpath, roughly follows the entire route, including the length of Killhope Burn.\n\n===Wearhead to Bishop Auckland===\n[[File:River Wear Weardale 20070617.jpg|thumb|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows from [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] to [[Frosterley]]]]\n\nThere are several towns, sights and tourist places along the length of the river. The market town of [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] is known in part for the ford across the river. From here the river is followed by the line of the [[Weardale Railway]], which crosses the river several times, through [[Frosterley]], [[Wolsingham]], and [[Witton-le-Wear]] to [[Bishop Auckland]].\n\n===Bishop Auckland to Durham===\nOn the edge of [[Bishop Auckland]] the Wear passes below Auckland Park and [[Auckland Castle]], the official residence of the [[Bishop of Durham]] and its [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. A mile or so downstream from here, the Wear passes [[Binchester Roman Fort]], [[Vinovia]], having been crossed by [[Dere Street]], the Roman road running from [[Eboracum]] (now [[York]]) to [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]] (now [[Corbridge]]) close to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile [[flood plain]]s and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] (near [[Croxdale]]), and [[Shincliffe]]. At Sunderland Bridge the [[River Browney]] joins the River Wear.\n\n===Durham===\n[[File:River wear at durham.jpg|thumb|left|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows through [[Durham, England|Durham]].]]\nWhen it reaches the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]] the River Wear passes through a deep, wooded gorge, from which several springs emerge, historically used as sources of [[potable water]]. A few coal seams are visible in the banks. Twisting sinuously in an incised [[meander]], the river has cut deeply into the \"Cathedral Sandstone\" bedrock. The high ground (bluffs) enclosed by this meander is known as the ''Peninsula'', forming a defensive enclosure, at whose heart lies [[Durham Castle]] and [[Durham Cathedral]] and which developed around [[the Bailey]] into Durham city. That area is now a UN [[World Heritage Site]].  Beneath [[Elvet Bridge]] are Brown's Boats (rowing boats for hire) and the mooring for the Prince Bishop, a pleasure cruiser.\n\nThe River Wear at Durham was featured on a television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of [[Northern England]].\n\nIn June each year, the [[Durham Regatta]], which predates that at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], attracts rowing crews from around the region for races along the river's course through the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Durham Regatta |url=http://www.durham-regatta.org.uk/|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> Seven smaller Regattas and Head Races are held throughout the rest of the year, which attract a lower number of competitors. There are 14 boathouses<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last       = Durham College Rowing\n |title      = Boat Clubs in Durham\n |accessdate = 2008-12-28\n |url        = http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120728162131/http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|url-status   = dead\n|archive-date = 2012-07-28\n}}\n</ref> and [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear#Durham|20 boat clubs]] based on the Wear in Durham.\n\nTwo weirs impede the flow of the river at Durham, both originally created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring [[sea trout]] and [[salmon]], and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).\n\nThe river's banks also lend their name to a [[hymn tune]] ''[[Elvet Banks]]'' in the 2006 hymnbook of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], used (appropriately) for a [[hymn]] for [[baptism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lutheran Music |url=http://www.lutheranmusic.com/library/LSB/pages/hymns/lsb407-midi.html|accessdate=2008-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Durham to Chester-le-Street===\n[[File:fichale.jpg|thumb|[[Finchale Priory]] on the banks of the River Wear between Durham City and Chester-le-Street. Note the wooden footbridge across the river on the right of the photograph.]]\nBetween Durham City and [[Chester-le-Street]], {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} due north, the River Wear changes direction repeatedly, flowing south westwards several miles downstream having passed the medieval site of [[Finchale Priory]], a former chapel and later a satellite monastery depending on the abbey church of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Two miles downstream, the river is flowing south eastwards. The only road bridge over the Wear between Durham and Chester-le-Street is Cocken Bridge. As it passes [[Chester-le-Street]], where the river is overlooked by [[Lumley Castle]], its flood plain has been developed into [[Riverside Ground|The Riverside]], the home pitch of [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. Passing through the Lambton Estate and near [[Lambton Castle]] the river becomes tidal, and navigable.\n\n===Chester-le-Street to Sunderland===\nOn exiting the Lambton estate the river leaves County Durham and enters the [[City of Sunderland]], specifically the southern/south-eastern edge of the new town of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. At [[Fatfield]] the river passes beneath [[Lambton Worm|Worm Hill]], around which the [[Lambton Worm]] is reputed to have curled its tail.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lambton Worm |work=The Legends and Myths of Britain |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611223547/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlready the riverbanks are showing evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries and chemical works. A little further downstream the river passes beneath the Victoria Viaduct, (formally called the Victoria Bridge). Named after the newly crowned queen, the railway viaduct opened in 1838, was the crowning achievement of the [[Leamside Line]], then carrying what was to become the [[East Coast Main Line]].  A mile to the east is [[Penshaw Monument]], a local iconic landmark. As the river leaves the environs of Washington, it forms the eastern boundary of [[WWT Washington|Washington Wildfowl Trust]].\n\n===Sunderland===\n[[File:St peters campus.jpg|thumb|left|As the river approaches its outfall into the North Sea, it flows past [[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]], [[University of Sunderland]].<br />''Shadows in Another Light'', a sculpture in which the shadow cast by a tree represents a hammerhead crane, unique to the Sunderland shipyards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice in Sunderland |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/alice.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> can be seen at the left of this image.]]\n\nHaving flowed beneath the [[A19 road|A19 trunk road]], the river enters the suburbs of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The riverbanks show further evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of [[shipyard]]s. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders were some of the most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist [[L. S. Lowry]] visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the industrial landscape around the river. Four bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] to the west, the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]], and the Wearmouth rail and [[Wearmouth Bridge|road]] bridges in the city centre.\n\nOn both banks at this point there are modern developments, some belonging to the [[University of Sunderland]] ([[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]]; Scotia Quay residences) and to the [[National Glass Centre]]. A riverside [[sculpture trail]] runs alongside this final section of its north bank.<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/sculpture.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project was created by Colin Wilbourn, with crime novelist and ex-poet [[Chaz Brenchley]]. They worked closely with community groups, residents and schools.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bryan |last=Talbot |authorlink=Bryan Talbot |title=[[Alice in Sunderland]]: An Entertainment |year=2007 |publisher=Jonathon Cape |location=London|isbn=0-224-08076-8 |pages=95\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nAs the river approaches the sea, the north bank (Roker) has a substantial residential development and marina.  A dolphin nicknamed Freddie was a frequent visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity.  However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk the safety of the dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft. The south bank of the river is occupied by what remains of the Port of Sunderland, once thriving and now almost gone.\n\nThe River Wear flows out of Sunderland between [[Roker]] Pier and South Pier, and into the [[North Sea]].\n{{clearleft}}\n== See also ==\n* [[List of crossings of the River Wear]]\n* [[List of rivers of England]]\n* [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear]]\n* [[Harry Watts]] \u2013 multiple River Wear life-saver\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge railway viaduct 20070630.jpg|[[Croxdale Viaduct]] carrying the [[East Coast Main Line]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge 20070630.jpg|[[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge (2) 20070630.JPG|Sunderland Bridge\nImage:River Wear Shincliffe Bridge 20070630.JPG|The 1826 stone bridge at [[Shincliffe]]\nImage:River Wear Maiden Castle Bridge 20070630.JPG|Maiden Castle footbridge\nImage:River Wear Baths Bridge 20070630.JPG|Baths Bridge \nImage:River Wear New Elvet Bridge 20070630.JPG|[[New Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Elvet Bridge (1) 20070630.JPG|[[Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Durham Kingsgate Bridge 20070630.jpg|looking towards [[Kingsgate Bridge]]\nImage:Dunelm-view.jpg|Kingsgate Bridge\nImage:River Wear Durham Prebends Bridge (1) 20011229.jpg|[[Prebends Bridge]]\nImage:Durham City 30c 20031207 Prebends Bridge 02a.jpg|Prebends Bridge\nImage:Durham City 35c 20030907 River Wear 01 upstream.jpg|[[Milburngate Bridge]] (foreground) and [[Framwellgate Bridge]] (background)\nImage:Durham City 20030907 Pennyfeather Bridge 03 (originals).JPG|[[Pennyferry Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070701 Cocken Bridge 01.jpg|[[Cocken Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Fatfield Bridge 01.jpg|[[Fatfield]] Bridge\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Victoria Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Victoria Viaduct]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Hylton Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Hylton Viaduct]]\nImage:Wearmouth bridge.jpg|[[Wearmouth Bridge]]\nImage:Roker Lighthouse - geograph.org.uk - 1095762.jpg|[[Roker]] Pier lighthouse, where the river meets the sea\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes \n{{Reflist|group=n}}  \n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Natural Environment Research Council]], Institute of Geological Sciences, 1971, \"British Regional Geology: Northern England\" Fourth Edition, HMSO, London.\n*Johnson, G.A.L. & Hickling, G.
