Its [[headwaters]] are two streams on [[Hampstead Heath]], each of which was dammed into a series of ponds\u2014the [[Hampstead Ponds]] and the [[Highgate Ponds]]\u2014in the 18th century. At the southern edge of Hampstead Heath these descend underground as [[combined sewer|sewers]] and join in [[Camden Town]]. The waters flow {{convert|4|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the ponds to the [[River Thames]].\n\nThe river gives its name to [[Fleet Street]], the eastern end of which is at what was the crossing over the river known as Fleet Bridge, and is now the site of [[Ludgate Circus]].\n\n==Course==\n[[Image:St Pancras Old Church in 1815.jpg|thumb|The Fleet passing by [[St Pancras Old Church]]]]\nThe Fleet rises on [[Hampstead Heath]] as two sources, which flow on the surface as the Hampstead Ponds and the Highgate Ponds. Then they go underground, pass under [[Kentish Town]], join in [[Camden Town]], and flow onwards towards [[St Pancras Old Church]], which was sited on the river's banks. From there it passed in a sinuous course which is responsible for the unusual building line adjacent to [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] station; the [[German Gymnasium, London|German Gymnasium]] faced the river banks, and the curve of the Great Northern Hotel follows the river, which passes alongside it.\n\nKing's Cross was originally named ''Battle Bridge'', referring to an ancient bridge over the Fleet where [[Boudica]]'s army is said to have fought an important battle against the Romans; the name was changed in the 19th century to refer to a statue of [[George IV]] and quickly replaced by the 'lighthouse' building that still stands today. From there, it heads down King's Cross Road, from where the valley slope can be seen in the surrounding streets, and into Clerkenwell; the comparatively steep valley is responsible for the viaduct bridges which carry local roads over the valley floor.\n\nThe river then flows down [[Farringdon Road]] and [[Farringdon Street]], where the valley broadens out, and straightens, and joins the Thames beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]].\n\n==Name==\nThe river's name is derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] {{lang|ang|fl\u0113ot}} \"tidal [[inlet]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=fleet, n.<sup>2</sup>}}</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times, the Fleet served as a [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] for [[shipping]].\n\nThe lower reaches of the river were known as the Holbourne (or Oldbourne), whence [[Holborn]] derived its name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trench|first=Richard|author2=Hillman, Ellis |title=London under London: a subterranean guide|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1993|edition=Second|page=33|isbn=0-7195-5288-5}}</ref>\n\nThe river gives its name to [[Fleet Street]] which runs from Ludgate Circus to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] at [[Strand, London|the Strand]]. In the 1970s, a [[London Underground]] tube line was planned to lie under the line of Fleet Street, provisionally named the [[Jubilee line#1939 to 1979, the Fleet line|Fleet line]]. However, it was renamed the [[Jubilee line]] in 1977, and plans for the part of the route through the [[City of London]] were subsequently abandoned.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, the Fleet was a major river, with its estuary possibly containing the oldest [[tidal mill]] in the world.<ref>[http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf Spain, Rob: \"A possible Roman Tide Mill\", Paper submitted to the ''Kent Archaeological Society'']</ref> The river secured the western flank of the Roman City.\n\n[[File:Map Londinium 400 AD-en.svg|thumb|alt=Vector map of Londinium in 400 AD|Londinium in the year 400 showing the Fleet to its west.

Many [[water well|wells]] were built along its banks, and some on springs (Bagnigge Well, [[Clerkenwell]]) and St Bride's Well, were reputed to have healing qualities; in the 13th century the river was called River of Wells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wickstead|first=Thomas|title=On the supply of water to the Metropolis|journal=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|date=January 1840|volume=III|issue=28|page=10}}</ref> The small lane at the south-west end of New Bridge Street is called Watergate because it was the river entrance to [[Bridewell Palace]].\n\nAs London grew, the river became increasingly a [[combined sewer|sewer]]. The area came to be characterised by poor-quality housing and prisons: Bridewell Palace itself was converted into a prison; [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]], [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[Ludgate]] prisons were all built in that area.  In 1728 [[Alexander Pope]] wrote in his ''[[Dunciad]]'', \"To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams / Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames / The king of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud / with deeper sable blots the silver flood\".<ref>''Dunciad'', book the second</ref>\n\n[[File:River Fleet, 1844, 2.png|thumb|left|The Fleet Ditch in 1844]]\nFollowing the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, architect [[Christopher Wren]]'s proposal for widening the river was rejected. Rather, the Fleet was converted into the New Canal, completed in 1680 under the supervision of [[Robert Hooke]]. Newcastle Close and Old Seacoal Lane (now just short alleyways off Farringdon Street) recall the [[wharves]] that used to line this canal, especially used by the coastal coal trade from the [[north-east of England]].  (An adjacent narrow road, Seacoal Lane, also existed until the late 20th century, when the present building fronting onto Farringdon Street was built, perhaps suggesting that a new wharf had been built near the old one.)\n\nThe upper canal, unpopular and unused, was from 1737 enclosed between [[Holborn]] and [[Ludgate Circus]] to form the \"[[Fleet Market]]\". The lower part, the section from [[Ludgate Circus]] to the Thames, had been covered by 1769 for the opening of the new Blackfriars Bridge and was consequently named \"New Bridge Street\".\n\nThe development of the [[Regent's Canal]] and urban growth covered the river in King's Cross and [[Camden Town|Camden]] from 1812. The Fleet Market was closed during the 1860s with the construction of [[Farringdon Road]] and [[Farringdon Street]] as a highway to the north and the [[Metropolitan Railway]], while the final upper section of the river was covered when Hampstead was expanded in the 1870s.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Fleet Mouth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mouth of the River Fleet in 2002, appearing as a drainage outlet (obscured in shadow) in the [[Thames Embankment|embankment]] wall beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]]]]\nThe Fleet, or rather the sewer that now follows its route, can be heard through a grating in Ray Street, [[Clerkenwell]]<ref>[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=531385&y=182157&z=1&sv=ray+street&st=1&tl=Ray+Street+Bridge+(off+Farringdon+Lane),+EC1&searchp=newsearch.srf&mapp=newmap.srf Ray Street Bridge (off Farringdon Lane), EC1].

It is also mentioned in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio adventure ''[[Dead London]]''.\n*In Neil Gaiman's television serial and novel ''[[Neverwhere]]'' (1996), the Great Beast of London is said to be a feral boar hog that ran into the Fleet while it was still partially open to the air, and vanished underground into the depths of London Below, growing huge and fat off the sewage.\n*The 2003\u20132004 ''[[The Baroque Cycle|Baroque Cycle]]'', [[Neal Stephenson]]'s three volumes series set in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, has many references to the Fleet Ditch, including discussion of the polluted state of the waterway.\n*The [[Christopher Fowler]] crime thriller ''The Water Room'' (2004) uses the Fleet as a major setting.\n*In Guy Ritchie's [[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|''Sherlock Holmes'']] (2009), a blindfolded Sherlock (played by [[Robert Downey Jr.]]) uses the presence of the bump at the 'Fleet Conduit' in order to gain his bearings: \"After that, the carriage forked left, then right, and then the tell-tale bump at the Fleet Conduit.\" \n*The Fleet is mentioned in the novel ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' (2011) by [[Ben Aaronovitch]]; and in ''Blue Monday'' (2011) by crime novelist [[Nicci French]].\n*\"London Underground\", a 2014 episode of BBC One drama ''[[New Tricks]]'', features a storyline about a murder by an occult group in the 1970s who believed that the Fleet demanded human sacrifices.\n*The novel ''Goodnight, John-Boy'' (2017) by [[Pat Mills]] depicts the disposal of a murder victim\u2019s body through an access hatch into the Fleet sewer pipe, where it is washed out into the Thames.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tributaries of the River Thames]]\n* [[Subterranean rivers of London]]\n* [[List of rivers in England]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712151537/http://www.sub-urban.com/fleet/ Sub-Urban.com \u2014 River Fleet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929065639/http://www.silentuk.com/writeups/fleet.html Photos From The Buried River Fleet]\n* [http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/fs1/fs1cp1.htm Chesca Potter, \"The River of Wells\"]\n* [http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=531385&y=182157&z=1&sv=ray+street&st=1&tl=Ray+Street+Bridge+(off+Farringdon+Lane),+EC1&searchp=newsearch.srf&mapp=newmap.srf Map showing Ray Street Bridge]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5609299,-0.1578535,1495m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en Google Earth view] of [[Hampstead Heath]], showing the Hampstead Ponds and the Highgate Ponds.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{River confluence start|River=[[River Thames]]}}\n{{River item line|upstream=[[River Effra]] (south)\n|downstream =[[Walbrook]] (north) \n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Coord|51|30|39|N|0|6|16|W|type:waterbody_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fleet, River}}\n[[Category:Geography of the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Geography of the City of London]]\n[[Category:Subterranean rivers of London]]\n[[Category:Thames drainage basin|1Fleet]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Fleet"}

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice.

They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The  peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti|Cavallino]]/Punta Sabbioni forms the northern part and the peninsula of [[Sottomarina]] forms the southern part. The sea has access to the lagoon through three inlets between the islands and between the islands and the peninsulas. At the northern end of Lido there is the Lido inlet which separates it from Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni and at the southern end there is the Malamocco inlet which separates it from Pellestrina.<ref>[http://cigno.atlantedellalaguna.it/maps/7/view Atlas of the Lagoon]</ref> These two inlets have been dredged to a greater depth to allow big ships through. The Malamocco inlet is the deepest one and is used by container ships and oil tankers to reach the commercial and industrial port of [[Marghera]]. The Lido inlet is the widest one (c.1&nbsp;km) and is used by cruise ships to reach Venice.\n\nLido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.\n\nThe island is home to a town and a village. The town is in the north. It is also called Lido (population 15128 in 2019<ref name = portale>[https://portale.comune.venezia.it/millefoglie/statistiche/home Portale comune Venezia]</ref>). Its neighbourhoods are San Nicol\u00f2, Santa Maria Elisabetta, on the lagoon side coast (the landing stage for the Venice ferry is in the former and the one for the water bus is in the latter), and Quattro Fontane and La Favorita, on the seaward coast. It developed in the 19th century as a tourist centre, both as a leisure seaside resort and as a [[balneotherapy]] resort. It has many 19th century villas built in [[Liberty style]] (the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]) and many hotels. It is famous for being the seat of the [[Venice Film Festival]] and for its grand hotels, such as the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], the Hotel Excelsior.<ref>[https://famoushotels.org/hotels/excelsior-lido-Venice Famous hotels]</ref> and the Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria <ref>[http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/ausoniahungariavenicelido.html Historic Hotels Now]</ref> which have hosted celebrities,  artists and writers, major businessmen, politicians and royalties. The  Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (27 m wide and c. 700 m long) crosses the town from coast to coast and links the water bus landing stage to the beach.\n\nThe village of [[Malamocco]] (with a population of 1030 as of 2019)<ref name=portale/> is on the lagoon side coast, in the central-southern part of the island. From the 12th century to the 19th century it was the only significant settlement on the island. It was built after the settlement of Metamaucum, which had been the second capital of the [[Duchy of Venetia]], was submerged by a storm surge.\n\nAt the southern end of the islands there is Alberoni, an area of sand dunes. It has Venice's golf course<ref>[https://www.1golf.eu/en/club/circolo-golf-venezia/ Circolo Golf Venezia]</ref> and the Alberoni Dune Oasis which has one of the largest and best-preserved dune systems on the coasts of the Northern Adriatic Sea, with dunes up to 10 meters high, a large, c. 30 [[hectares]], pine forest and unique species of flora and fauna.<ref>[http://www.veniceandlagoon.net/web/en/itineraries/nature/alberoni-dunes-and-ca-roman/Alberoni Dunes]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Metamaucum===\n[[Malamocco|Metamaucum]] was one of the earliest settlements in the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. Its origins dated back to the Roman days. It became the second ducal seat of the [[duchy of Venetia]] (before the rise of Venice) when [[Teodato Ipato]] (742-55), the second [[doge]], transferred it from Heraclea, to 811, when the doge [[Agnello Participazio]] (811-27) moved it to Rivoalto. It was temporarily occupied by [[Pepin of Italy]] when he tried to invade the lagoon in 810. It was destroyed by the doge [[Giovanni I Participazio]] (829\u2013836) when he suppressed a rebellion based in Metamaucum. The settlement continued to be inhabited, but it was a shadow of its former self. Its decadence reached its peak when its priory was moved to the island of [[Murano]] (1080), the S.S. Leone e Basso nuns moved to the island of [[San Servolo]] (1109) and its [[dioceses]] was moved to Chioggia between 1107 and 1110. In 1116 it was submerged as a result of an exceptional storm surge. According to the tradition, Metamaucum was on the seashore of the Lido island, rather than on its lagoon shore.\n\nA new settlement was built on the lagoon shore of Lido, close to where Metamaucum had been. The existence of a Metamaucum Nova, which corresponds to today's Malamocco, was first attested in 1107.<ref>Lanfranchi, L., Zille, G.,  Il territorio del Ducato Veneziano dall'VIII al XII secolo, in  Storia di Venezia, 1958, pp. 27-28</ref>\n\n===Military island===\nUntil the 19th century Lido's main role was a military one for the defence of  the lagoon as it lies by the lido inlet, the widest point of entry of the lagoon and the one which is closest to Venice. It continued to have a military tole until WW II. Prior to the 19th century it was also a scarcely populated island. In 1820 Lido has 814 inhabitants, 662 of whom lived in Malamocco, and 152 lived in San   Nicol\u00f2.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 600 a lookout tower was built at San Nicol\u00f2, at the northern end of Lido, on its lagoon side shore, to monitor enemy ships, particularly pirate ships, approaching the lagoon at the Lido inlet. In 1100 it was strengthened and developed into a fort under the doge [[Vitale I Michiel]] (1096-1102). This fort was later called Castel Vecchio (Old Castle).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1229 crossbow shooting ranges were created in areas of Venice for weekly exercises by men between the ages of 16 and 35. In 1229 a shooting range was established at San Nicol\u00f2. It hosted shooting contests at Christmas and Easter to make the exercises more interesting. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery units were also stationed in the area and foundries for armaments and munitions were built where the Jewish cemetery was later set up. In 1304 a militia was instituted. The sailing to Lido was also turned into a contest. The men rowed to the island on boats (called ganzaruoli) with 30-40 oarsmen boats which competed over who would get there first. This is the origin of the word regatta. The only establishment that sold wine at San Nicol\u00f2 was closed during the contests. A lighthouse was also built close to the shooting range. A permanent garrison was set up.  It served as rest area for troops which needed to briefly stop by. Wells to supply freshwater to ships that left the city were built.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 60, 64-65</ref>\n\nIn the mid-14th century tensions between Venice and the [[Republic of Genoa]] escalated due to their rivalry over supremacy of the naval routes and trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean . 1318. San Nicol\u00f2 was bombed several times by a Genoese fleet.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 62</ref>\n\nIn 1335 the Gagiandra (turtle in Venetian) was built. It was a platform for artillery which was placed in the Lido channel which went from the Lido inlet to Venice. It was broad and tapered at the stern and bow. It was covered by a metal plate which acted  as a shield. The canons were sticking out of this shield. This gave it the appearance of the head, tail and legs of a turtle. The platform was placed between the Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) at San Nicol\u00f2 and the Castel Novo (New Castle) on the [[Vignole]] island. These two islands and the island of Certosa formed the shores of the channel. An iron chain was placed across the channel. It was supported by the Gagiandra and two rafts placed midway between the \"turtle\" and the two shores. The chain was kept close to the surface of the water to prevent enemy ships to pass above it.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn 1379 Genoa attacked the lagoon in the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). Two towers were built as platforms for crossbows and cannons at the Castel Vecchio and Novo forts (on the Lido and Vignole islands) on the two sides of the Lido channel, to further protect the entrance to the lagoon. Small boats which were chained together were placed between the two towers. Between them there were three ships with archers covered with fresh hides to protect them from fire. A ditch and earthen rampant strengthened with stone were created to protect the S. Nicol\u00f3 abbey. Eventually Venice won the war.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 66-6</ref>\n\nIn 1409 an admiralty was established at S. Nicol\u00f2. 1520 The [[Council of Ten]] build a building to house its offices and barracks for its officers who were entrusted with monitoring Lido, its fortresses, its inlet and the way the sea changed its beaches. This was called the Casa Rossa (Red House).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp.70, 78</ref>\n \nIn the 16th century, with the Turkish conquests in south-eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, which were a threat to the Venetian dominion in that part of the Mediterranean the Turks were also considered a threat to Venice itself.\n\nBetween 1543 and 1549 Castel Novo, on the Vignole island, was developed into the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. Between 1546 and 1574 Castel Novo at San Nicol\u00f2 was developed into the San Nicol\u00f2 fort. Between 1569 and 1574 the latter was strengthened with a triple ditch. Artillery was placed on the seaward side. There were no batteries on the lagoon side in case the fortress was seized and the cannons would be used against the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. The fort became a complex with the military headquarter of the [[Republic of Venice]]. The whole area became a c. 521 m long fortified citadel stretching along the lagoon coast with brick barriers and bastions, a dike and an earthen fore wall. It was later was extended towards the sea with angular barriers, six gates and underground exits on the sea beach side, towards the entrance to the Lido inlet. Inside the new fortification there were the old San Nicol\u00f2 church and its convent and the adjacent Palazzo dei dieci/Casa Rossa at the back. In 1572 an Istrian stone bridge that looked like a triumphal arch over the dock was built to provide access to the citadel.\n\nLarge barracks for the troops, known as Saraglio, Quartier Grando or Palazzo dei Soldati (Stronghold, Large Quarters or Building of the Soldiers) were built between 1591 and 1594. It was an imposing building which provided lodgings for 2000 soldiers. It was the first true barracks in Europe, the first instance in which troops were lodged in peacetime. It was an important step towards the creation of a modern army as opposed to a mercenary army or a militia. It was built on the location where the crusaders had gathered before setting off for the fourth crusade. From 1600 the barracks hosted the Fanti da Mar (Infantrymen of the Sea), the first amphibian troops in history, a sort of precursor of today\u2019s marines.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28-29, 83-84</ref>\n\nIn 1571 it was decided to build octagonal forts for artillery batteries on islets off the lagoon side shore of Lido. They were the Ottagono Campana (later called Abbandonato, abandoned octagon),  between Malamocco and Alberoni (off the southern end of the Lido island) and the Ottagono Alberoni, by Alberoni and the northern end of the Malamocco inlet, the other point of access into the lagoon, where ships could turn towards Venice. The Ottagono di Poveglia (further north, on the Poveglia island, off Malamocco) acted as a reinforcement for the other two octagons further south. Two octagons were built off the [[Pellestrina]] island, the Ottagono San Pietro, at the northern end of the island and the southern end of the Malamocco inlet and the Ottagono Caroman, at the southern end of Pellestrina to guard the Chioggia inlet, the third entry point of the lagoon. In 1572, 75 artillery were supplied for the San Nicol\u00f2 fort and 56 for Sant\u2019Andrea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 83-84</ref>\n\nSan Nicol\u00f2 was also where the soldiers and the ships for Venice\u2019s naval expeditions in the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea gathered and set off from. Some of these were:\n\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. In 1099, 207 ships set off at the end of the first crusade to help the crusaders to consolidate their conquests. It defeated a fleet of their Genoese rivals off [[Rhodes]]. In 1124 a fleet sets off to free the [[King of Jerusalem]] who had been imprisoned in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Lebanon]]. It had 108 vessels, 40 galleys 40 supply ships and 28 ships with rams. It besieged and seized Tyre. In 1171 A fleet set off for a battle against the emperor Byzantine Emmanuel Kommenos who had the Venetians in Constantinople arrested. The fleet was defeated more by the plague that the Byzantines, who were was joined by the rival maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]. In 1202 the crusaders of the fourth crusade gathered at Lido in preparation to be taken to the East by Venetian ships. In 1690 Francesco Morosini set off for a campaign in the Peloponnese. He was elected as doge while away. He was met at Lido by the abbot while the senators waited for him of the Bucintoro, the ceremonial boat of the doge. In 1784 there was a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 50, 54, 55, 58, 94, 100</ref>\n\n===Pope, emperor and the Peace of Venice===\nThe emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I, Barbarossa]] (reigned 1155-1190) conducted six military campaigns in Italy, which was under his [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Originally he wanted to confront the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the south. However, his intervention in Italy was opposed by several Italian cities, particularly [[Milan]], which he had partially destroyed during his second campaign. A dispute with [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159-1181) developed because Frederick endorsed [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|antipope Victor IV]], who had been elected in opposition to Alexander. Opposition against Frederick in northern Italy grew and the [[Lombard League]], a league formed by several cities, fought him. Frederick was defeated at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176. Preliminary peace negotiations took place at [[Anagni]] (the Peace of Anagni) in 1176.<ref>Davis, R. H. C. A History of Medieval Europe, 1957, p.332 et seq.</ref>  Negotiations involving all the concerned parties to reach a formal peace treaty took place in Venice where a conference was scheduled for July 1177. The [[doge]] [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u201378) was to act as an intermediary.\n\nThe pope arrived in Venice in 10 May 1177. Negotiations with the Lombard League and the king of Sicily started but they were taking a hard stance. Frederick was not allowed to go to Venice and waited for news in Ravenna. A pro-Frederick faction in Venice encouraged Frederick to come to Venice in defiance of the veto, but the emperor declined to do so without the doge\u2019s approval. Because of internal pressure, Ziani hesitated. The envoys of the League left Venice for [[Treviso]] in protest. The head of the Sicilian delegation threatened to leave and said that his king would take revenge on Venice breach of faith. This would have meant retaliation against Venetian traders in Sicily. The doge confirmed that Frederick would be allowed to enter Venice only after this received papal approval.\n\nThis situation highlighted the danger of a breakdown in the talks and negotiations proceeded more rapidly. On 23 July the agreement was completed. At the pope request, Venetian ships went to [[Chioggia]] to pick up the emperor, who was taken to Lido. Four cardinals went there to meet him there. Frederick recognised Alexander as the rightful pope and could now be allowed to enter Venice. Doge Ziani went to meet him at San Nicol\u00f2 and took him to Venice with great pomp. A ceremony was held at St. Mark\u2019s basilica.<ref>Norwich, J. J., A History of Venice, 2003, pp. 111-16</ref>\n\n===The Wedding to the Sea===\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. Istria and Dalmatia accepted Venice's [[suzerainty]]. To celebrate this the Venetians celebrated with the ''Benedictio del Mare'' (Blessing of the Sea) ceremony,  which was held annually until 1177. In that year, after Venice's mediation which led to the Peace of Venice, it was replaced by the ''Sposalizio col Mare'' (Wedding with the Sea) .\n\nIn this ceremony the doge sailed for Lido on the bucintoro (the doge's ceremonial ship) with the top clergy, the top officials of the [[Republic of Venice]] and ambassadors. This was followed by a  large number of Venetians on various kinds of vessels. It was a festive parade. Between Lido and the Sant'Andrea fort (see above), where the [[Lagoon of Venice]] meets the [[Adriatic Sea]], the doge took a golden ring which pope Alexander III had donated him. He then threw it into the sea. It was attached to a string so that it can be retrieved. The doge then recited \"We marry thee, oh sea, in a sign of eternal domination.\" The ceremony ended in 1797 when the Republic fell with its conquest by Napoleon. It was performed on the first Sunday after [[ascension day]].\n\nThe ceremony and [[f\u00eate]] was performed again in 1965 and in 1988. The latter was an initiative by private citizens and cultural and sport associations which wanted to relaunch the celebrations.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 55-56, 202, 215</ref> The ceremony became permanent and is now led by the mayor of Venice\n\nThe ceremony was also associated with the ''Festa della Sensa'' (F\u00eate of Ascension). In 1180 it developed into the ''Fiera della Sensa'' (Ascension [[Fair]]). There were acrobats, jugglers and minstrels in all the streets of Venice. There was a large market in [[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]]. From 1307 the market had especially prepared stands which over time became increasingly decoratively elaborate. Goods of all kinds and from all over the world were displayed.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 56</ref>\n\n===Murazzi===\nThe engineer Bernardo Zendrini found that [[pozzolana]] mixed with chalk and sand was an efficient water-resistant binder. In 1737 he built a 2.5 m long test wall near Malamocco. Three years later it had withstood two winter storm surges (one of which had been one of the worst) without damage. This led to the building of the murazzi, imposing walls made with large blocks of [[Istrian stone]] to form a continuous sea defence on the barrier island of Pellestrina. Later murazzi were built at Lido as well, but here they were discontinuous. A previously unknown 350 m long test wall brought was to light by the seaward shore in 1980. It lies 380 from the sea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 97</ref> This is because after the construction of the breakwater at San Nicol\u00f2 (see below), sand has been accumulating on the sea shore in the northern part of the island, widening the beach.\n\n===Churches, monasteries convents and saints===\nIn 887 the male Benedictine monastery of  San Cipriano was founded in Malamocco on the initiative of doge [[Giovanni II Participazio]]. This was followed by the female monastery of Santi Leone and Basso. In 1108 San Cipriano was abandoned due to damage caused by the sea and daily ground collapses. The friars moved to the [[Murano]] island and set up a new monastery of S. Cipriano. In 1109, for the same reason, the nuns moved to a convent on the [[San Servolo]] island vacated by Benedictine monks who had moved to the monastery of Sant'Ilario near Fusina.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 42, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1045 the doge Domenico Contarini I (1043\u201371), the [[Patriarch of Grado]] and the bishop of  Olivolo founded the church and convent of San Nicol\u00f2. The works for the church  were completed in 1064. In 1053, the management of the church and convent was handed to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. In 1098 some of relics three of saints from [[Myra]] (now [[Demre]]), west of the [[Chelidonia (islands)|Chelidonia]] cape, [[Lydia]], on the southern coast of what is now [[Turkey]], were smuggled by a naval squadron which returned form the first crusade and placed in the San Nicol\u00f2 church. The saints were  Nicol\u00f2 Major, his uncle Nicol\u00f2 Minor and Theodoros. The church, which was small, was enlarged in 1134 and urns with the relics were moved from the crypt and put in three niches by the main altar. Between 1626 and 1634 the church was demolished and rebuilt, together with the bell tower, using material from the old church. In 1770 the Benedictines moved to San Giorgio Maggiore island because a 1768 law closed confraternities with less than 12 monks or friars. The building became a military quarter. The church remained open for worship. In 1938 it was granted to Franciscan friars.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46-50, 52, 62, 90-91, 100, 187</ref>\n\nThe first record of the Abbey of San Leonardo between Alberoni and Malamocco dates to 1111. It was destroyed by fire, along with the whole of the Malamocco coast, during the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). In 1407 there was a bequest for the rebuilding of the monastery. The church was rebuilt with funds from the [[patriarch of Venice]]. The church merged with the San Camillo hospital in 1928 and was demolished to enlarge the hospital.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 53-54</ref>\n\nIn 1557 the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta church in Malamocco was rebuilt on top of old one, which dated to the 11th century.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 81</ref>\n\nIn 1620 there was a request to build a church at Lido to replace the unauthorised oratory of Beata Vergine Visitante Santa Elisabetta (Blessed Visiting Virgin St. Elizabeth) to the south of San Nicol\u00f2, which was built by the locals because they found it difficult to reach their parish church of [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] on the island with the same name.\nIn 1627 the construction of the new church, now called Santa Maria Elisabetta, on top of the old oratory was completed. The patriarch of Venice granted it the title of parish church. It was the second parish church of Lido, after Santa Maria Assunta in Malamocco. In 19th century, when the area became built up, it was named after this church.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 88-91</ref>\n\n===Jewish and protestant cemeteries===\nIn 1386 the Jews were granted a plot of uncultivated land to develop the Jewish cemetery. The friars of the San Nicol\u00f2 convent were opposed to this and claimed that they owned the land. A few years later to resolve this, the Jews paid a token rent. Consent was given and burials started in 1389. A Protestant cemetery was opened close to the Jewish one in 1674.  A very small Catholic cemetery was opened in 1866 in front of the entrance of the Jewish one. In 1916 it was replaced by a new one. A new Jewish cemetery was also built. Its monumental  entrance was completed in 1923. As a result, the Catholic cemetery lies between the old and new Jewish cemeteries.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 67-68, 94, 157, 168</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe accumulation of sand carried by the sea at the Malamocco and Lido inlets made their navigability problematic. During second Napoleonic occupation (1806\u201314), it was decided to build breakwaters on the southern and northern shore of the Malamocco inlet. The latter was to be built at Alberoni, on the southern tip of Lido. However, the works were not completed due to the second Austrian occupation (1814\u201348). The Austrians disagreed with the French plans. The project was entrusted to the engineer Pietro Paleocapa. Works at Alberoni started in 1838 and were completed in 1845. Works on the southern breakwater at Santa Maria del Mare, on the [[Pellestrina]] island, started in 1853 and were completed in 1856. The object of the northern breakwater to keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carried. That of the southern one was to channel the receding low tide water to make the inlet deeper through the force of the exit current.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 107-8, 115, 116, 118</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century and in the 19th century, a number of poets and writers wrote about Lido. This made Lido an attractive destination for people from the European elites in their then fashionable  journeys in Italy.  In 1786 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the German poet and scientist, visited Lido and wrote about his experience there in this book about his journey in Italy. [[Lord Byron]] spent five years (1816\u201321) in Venice and liked to ride his horses at Lido from a hut he rented at Alberoni. In 1818 he was visited by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The two spent a couple of days at Lido. Shelley wrote a poem about this. Since Byron was a celebrity, this attracted tourists who hoped to meet the poet or get a glimpse of him at Lido.<ref>Saikia, R., The Venice Lido: A Blue Guide Travel Monograph (e-Edition), ch.4</ref> In 1830 [[James Fenimore Cooper]], the author of [[The Last of the Mohicans]], visited and described Lido and used Venice as the background for his novel [[The Bravo]]. In 1841 [[John Ruskin]], the art critic who wrote about Venice and her art, also wrote about Lido. Other people who visited Lido and described it were and the French poet [[Theophile Gautier]], in 1850, [[Herman Melville]], the American novelist and poet, in 1857, and [[Hyppolyte Taine]], the French critic and historian, in 1864. Henry James first arrived in Venice in 1869. He went to Lido 14 times. He wrote about Venice in some of his novels and one of them was set in Venice. The British poet and playwright [[Robert Browning]] went to Lido in 1888 and died in Venice nearly two months later.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 101-2, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 123, 132</ref>\n\n[[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Frederick William]], the [[Duke of Brunswick]] (1771-1815) bought a plot of land at Lido, intending it to have his holiday home there. From 1879 queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] took her sickly son [[Victor Emmanuel III]], the heir to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on holiday at Lido, at the [[sea bathing]] facility of La Favorita. A royal chalet was arranged for her.<ref>Farina F., Architetture balneari tra Europa e Americhe nella Belle \u00e9poque, 2001, p. 10</ref>  In those days there was the belief that sea bathing had a curative or therapeutic value.\n\nTommaso Rima, a doctor at Venice\u2019s hospital, believed that bathing in the lagoon had therapeutic benefits for nervous illnesses, scrofulosis,<ref>A form of tuberculosis, most common in children, tending to cause enlarged and degenerated lymph nodes, especially in the neck, and often chronic, intractable skin inflammation as well, Wiktionary</ref> rickets and skin disorders. In 1833 he set up a floating bathing facility  at [[Punta della Dogana]], opposite [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark\u2019s]]. It consisted of two big rafts which created a pool with a grate at the bottom and which could be reassembled in the summer. There was a caf\u00e9 and one could sunbathe. The idea of bathing therapy caught on. Gondolas were adapted for the purpose and inns set up pools with water drawn for the nearby canals which was warmed up. There was an idea that this kind of bathing in the Venetian winter was particularly therapeutic. In 1857 a booklet about this notion published.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 114-15</ref>\n\nThe Lido\u2019s potential for tourism did not go unnoticed. In 1852 there was a proposal to set up two [[spa]]s, one on the lagoon shore and one on the sea shore, but it was then thought that the lagoon water was less pure. In 1855 De la Hante, a Frenchman, set up a bathing resort in the La Favorita area, which was named after the villa of the [[archduke Maximillian of Austria]] (1832-1867) the brother of the emperor who was in charge of the Austrian dominions in northern Italy (1815\u201359) and spent some of his time in Venice. The resort had 70 rooms. In 1872 De la Hante bought the archduke\u2019s villa to convert it into a restaurant, caf\u00e9, casino and 70 rooms for an exclusive beach resort. However, he then sold it to the Lido Bathing Resort Society (see below).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 118, 124</ref>\n\nIn 1857 Giovanni Busetto, nicknamed Fisola, also opened a seaside resort. This consisted of wooden cabins on pilings over the beach with a common central area and two wings with 15 small rooms each. Separate cabins for the lower classes were planned. It was demolished by the Austrians in 1859 due to the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against Austrian domination in northern Italy. In 1867, after Venice became part of Italy, the resort was reopened and expanded but was destroyed by a storm surge. It was reopened and expanded again in 1870. From 1867 to 1871 the number of bathers increased from 30 to 60 thousand.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 118-19</ref>\n\nIn 1857 a summer shuttle service to and from Venice was set up. It consisted of large boats with four oarsmen which could carry 16 passengers. In 1858 the road from the church of Santa Maria Elisabetta, which was by the landing stage in the lagoon coast and lead to the seacoast, was widened and made suitable for vehicle traffic. It eventually came to be called Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (or just Gran Viale). It was widened again in 1888 and a horse-drawn [[Horsebus|omnibus]] which took tourists to the beach along the Gran Viale entered into service. In the same year the military steamship Alnoch, which could carry up to 200 passengers, was made available for linking Lido with Venice during the tourist season from 6 am to 9 pm. This was then extended to 4 am to 11 pm.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119-20</ref>\n\nIn 1872 a group of entrepreneurs set up the ''Societ\u00e0 Civile dei Bagni di Lido'' (the Lido Bathing Resort Society). Its aim was to boost Lido's tourism potential. It bought the La Favorita villa, it reduced the number of its room to six to be used by queen Margaret. A large terrace which overlooked the sea was built. It could host 1500 people and had salons, caf\u00e9-restaurants, reading rooms and ballrooms, a telegraph and post office, medical assistance, a chemist and life guards with special lookout posts and boats. The group also wanted to promote sea bathing as a leisure activity as well as a therapeutic one. This idea was expounded by Paolo Mantegazza, a doctor who wrote about beaches and the sea as collective salons where people could rest and have fun.\n\nThe group planned more resorts and the urban development of the area between the landing stage of the lagoon side and the sea beach. This area came to be called Santa Maria Elisabetta. The project involved substantial land improvements and drainage on an island which was still largely rural and had areas of bog land and scattered dunes. A water drainage and sewer system was developed. The development was to have hospitality and entertainment facilities, residential areas, roads, gardens, woods, restaurants and cafes. Villas for wealthy bathers were built in Liberty style, the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]. The number of bathers increased from 60,000 in 1871 to 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.The number of small rooms for bathers increased to 600. They were equipped with facilities for seawater therapy with the spraying of rarefied water with compressed air.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119, 124-25</ref>\n\nIn 1873 a steam navigation company was established. This was the birth of the Venetian waterbus, the service for the  transport of people around the lagoon. It used steamboats which were smaller than the military one which had been used and thus allowed more frequent journeys. With regard to Lido, compared to oar boats, it shortened the time needed to reach Santa Maria Elisabetta from San Zaccaria (near St Mark's Square) dramatically, from one hour to ten minutes. In 1881 a regular time table with services every half an hour between 6 am and 12 pm was introduced. It entered into operation in 1882. In 1898 the Municipality of Venice took over the Grand Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta and widened it to 17 m to allow for a single-track horse-drawn tramway. The Bathing Resort Society was given permission to set this up in 1889 s up. It replaced the omnibus.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 126-27</ref>\n\n1885 a low-cost bathing resort for the lower classes with 150 small rooms was established. In 1887 and 1888 the bathing resort was expanded again and an electricity power plant was built. The first beach huts were installed for bathing and for \"air sunlight and sand\" therapy, which was popular among families. This development required the construction of a seafront boulevard. Further urbanisation took place and more villas were built. In 1889 an electric tramway line along the Gran Viale was introduced and from 1892 the Gran Viale had electric lighting during the tourist season. The number of tourists increased from 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 130, 32, 33</ref>\n\nThe Ospizio Marino (Sea Nursing Home) opened in 1870. It was a hospital for poor children who suffered from scrofulosis, which affected especially children form deprived backgrounds, who needed [[heliotherapy]]. Experiments conducted in 1842 indicated that what was then called sea therapy was the required treatment. The hospital had 200 beds. It was expanded to 500 beds in 1873. After the opening of the Excelsior Hotel in 1908 it was planned to move the hospital elsewhere to make room next to the hotel and to move the sick away from it. This occurred in the 1920s.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-47</ref>\n\nThe lido inlet had not used for navigation since 1724 because this was prevented by frequent sand accumulation. In 1866 the engineer Pietro Paleocapa submitted a plan to build two breakwaters to reopen the inlet, one on its northern shore (Punta Sabbioni) and the other on its southern shore (San Nicol\u00f2). They were to be 3,5&nbsp;km and 2.85&nbsp;km long respectively, extend in the direction of the [[Sirocco|Scirocco]] wind, give the inlet a width of 1&nbsp;km and reach a depth of 8 m. In 1870 studies showed that similar works on the Malamocco inlet has been effective in preventing sand accumulation and that the sand was stopped by the northern breakwater. It accumulated by it. The project was approved in 1871. The works started in 1882. The San Nicol\u00f2 breakwater was the first that was built. The works on both was completed in 1910 with the construction of a 26 m high lighthouse at Punta Sabbioni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 122-23, 125, 126, 127</ref>\n\nA theatre (Nuovo Teatro del Lido) which had 600 seats opened in 1892. A [[velodrome]] was opened in 1894, but cycling competitions were ended in 1896 due to high running costs. In 1911 it hosted period costume equestrian tournament which attracted a big crowd.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 133-34, 150</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe expansion of the bathing resorts and of the urbanisation of the Santa Maria Elisabetta area continued. From 1900 to 1920 some 50 villas were built. In 1904 a horse-riding school was established. Over the decades it held several international contests and two world cups. The planning for a boulevard to connect Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta to San Nicol\u00f2 started in 1905. An aquarium was opened next to the theatre in 1909. Both were later demolished.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 139, 140, 148</ref>\n\nLido also became an island of grand hotels. The Grand Hotel Lido, in Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta, the square in front of the landing stage, was opened in 1900. It was demolished in the 1970s. In the same year the famous [[Grand Hotel des Bains]] was opened.<ref>http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/bainsvenicelido.html Historic Hotels - Hotel des Bains</ref> The Hungaria Palace Hotel, later called Grand Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria, opened in 1907. It had 82 rooms furnished by Eugenio Quarti, a famous Milan furniture maker nicknamed prince of the ''ebanisti'' (carpenters who work with ebony). A [[maiolica]] [[mosaic]] with Renaissance motifs interpreted in liberty style \nwhich made the hotel very distinctive was installed on its facade between 1914 and 1916.<ref>Speziali A., Diletto e armonia.

Two flights from Venice to this beach were arranged later in the year. The last one attracted many people who paid tickets to get on the terrace of the hotel and crowded it. There was a lottery draw whose prize was a tour on the plane. More such flights were then organised. This helped to attract attention to the hotel. In 1914 the owner of the Excelsior opened a fun fair which was extremely successful. However, it was dismantled the next year because of WW I. Another one was opened in 1932 but it suffered the same fate because of WW II.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 149-50, 152-53, 181-82</ref>\n\nIn 1919 woks started on a staircase to a votive temple (built between 1925 and 1928) dedicated to the Madonna of Victory and built for the remembrance of the fallen soldiers of WW I. The bodies of 3700 soldiers are kept here.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 159-60</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s seaplanes became the next technological advance. A Frenchman organised an international competition, the Schneider International Cup, from 1920 to 1931. It was held at Lido in 1920, 1921 and 1927. It was extremely popular.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 161</ref>\n\nIn 1919 it was decided that the ''Ospizio Marino'' (see above) was to remain open permanently and not just in the summer. Between 1922 and 1926 a new site for the hospital was built in the La Favorita area. It was now opened to adults as well. The centre for rehabilitation for children with rickets merged with this hospital in 1924. The Ospizio developed [[balneotherapy]] (bathing therapy) psammotherapy (hot sand baths) and sun therapy. In 1933 it was renamed ''Ospedale al Mare'' (Hospital at the Sea). It became a hospital of specialised excellence and the foremost [[thalassotherapy]] (the use of seawater for therapy) centre in Italy. In 1933 a church was opened in this complex.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-24, 167-8, 182</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the Grand Hotel Company (CIGA) built a bagno popolare (low-cost bathing resort) and gave the municipality a large square to create a public playground. In 1923 another bagno popolare (later called zone A) was established next to the Ospizio Marino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 161, 169</ref>\n\nThe Nicelli airport was developed during WW I for the defence of Venice. In 1926 it was converted to civilian use with the construction of a terminal. The first light was to Vienna and carried four passengers. By 1931 there were six routes. In 1935 a second terminal was built. By 1939 there were 23,285 passengers. The major European airlines operated here and the airport was the second most important one in Italy after Rome. During  WW II much of its equipment was confiscated by the Germans, who also tried to destroy it. Operations resumed after the war. However, with the advent of bigger jet planes, the runway became too short. In 1961 the new [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]] was opened. The Nicelli airport only handled small private planes and hosted a school for pilots and parachutists. In 1994 the municipality of Venice set up a management firm to the restore the airport and relaunch economic activity in the area.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 173-75, 221</ref>\n\nIn 1930 the golf course at Alberoni was inaugurated. It was said that [[Henry Ford]] had been disappointed that Lido did not have a golf course. The area at the southern end of the island, which had sand dunes (sand would provide good drainage), trees and a former military fort and stables was chosen. Originally it had 9 holes. It was extended to 18 holes in 1951. The course is 6&nbsp;km long. It hosted Italian opens in 1955, 1960 and 1974.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 178-79</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 June 1934 Hitler went to Venice to meet Mussolini. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Venice and Mussolini stayed at the Grand Hotel Excelsior. The two men met at the golf club at Alberoni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 182</ref>\n\nVenice was the first city in the world to have a publicly owned and regulated casino. It opened in 1638. However, it was closed in 1774. In 1938 the casino (Palazzo del Casin\u00f2) at Lido was opened. This marked the return of legal gambling in Venice. It became a summer casino in 1946, when a winter venue was opened in Venice in what is now Ca\u2019 Vendramin Calergi, formerly the last residence of Richard Wagner, who died there. The Palazzo del Casin\u00f2 at Lido was closed in the 1990s when a new casino was opened at Ca\u2019 Noghera in the mainland.<ref>https://casino.gioconews.it/cronaca/40599-una-serenissima-casa-da-gioco Casa da Gioco</ref><ref>http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/venezia/da-vedere/monumento/ex-casin\u00f2-del-lido-5776 Ex casin\u00f2 del Lido</ref>\n\nIn 1946 and 1947 a motor race was held at the Lido circuit to relaunch tourism. [[Tazio Nuvolari]] came third in the second race. Lido hosted the road cycling world championship in 1952 and track cycling world championship in 1962. In the latter year the ice rink was opened. Prior to that the rich skated at an inner terrace of the Excelsior Hotel and the non-rich skated at a small garden by the casino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 191-2, 193-94</ref> \n \nIn the 1960s, the improving post-war Italian economy created a real-estate boom in the island and many Venetians moved to Lido to benefit from its modern infrastructure.\n\n== The Venice Film Festival ==\n{{main | Venice Film Festival}}\n[[File:66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) Palais du Cinema.jpg|thumb|253x253px| [[66th Venice International Film Festival|66th Venice Int. Film Festival]] on the Lido.]]\n\nLido di Venezia is home to the [[Venice International Film Festival]] <small>([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia'', \"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the [[Venice Biennale]]</small>\"). It is the world's oldest film festival and one of the three most prestigious ones, together with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>Anheier, H.K., Juergensmeyer M., eds., Encyclopedia of Global Studies, 2012, p. 566. Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014still hold the most prestigious status as cultural institutions that officially endorse the aesthetic and cinematic values of movies and critical currencies of film directors.</ref> These are sometimes called the \"Big Three\".<ref>Bordwell, D. (2005). Figures Traced in Light: On Cinematic Staging, 2005, p. 144. Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice).</ref>\n\nThe film festival started in 1932. It was the idea of the then chair of the [[Venice Biennale]] who was worried about a decline in tourism at Lido due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and understood that cinema could help to alleviate this. It was successful. The prince [[Umberto di Savoia]], the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Henry Ford]] and film stars such as [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Clark Gable]] attended. Forty films form six countries were shown on the terrace of the Excelsior hotel. No awards were given, but an audience referendum chose which films and performances were the most praiseworthy.\n\nThe second festival was held in 1934. It was meant to be a biennial event but it became annual because of the success of the first one. There were some 20 awards, but there was no jury. Premiers were shown, which increased the prestige of the festival. So did a scandal caused by a [[Gustav Machaty]]'s [[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]] which showed the first scenes with a female nude in cinema history, which also launched the career of the actress [[Hedy Lamarr|Hedy Lammarr]]. This time the films were shown in the garden of the Excelsior hotel. In 1937 the venue of the festival was opened. It is the Palazzo del Cinema.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 180, 182-83, 185</ref>\n\nIn 1939 the fascist government imposed the assignation of the awards to two propaganda films, a fascist one and a Nazi one. Because of this the Americans boycotted the 1940 festival. The 1940-41-42 editions are not listed as part of the festival because the government assumed total control of the screening of films and chose films from the \u201cRome-Berlin\u201d axis. These festival were screened at two cinemas in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned. In 1943-45 the festival was suspended because of the war. It resumed in 1946. However, the French wanted their new festival, the  [[Cannes Film Festival]], to start at the same time as he Venice one. After negotiations it was decided that Cannes would run in the spring and Venice would start later, in late August. In 1946 and 1947 the festival was held in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned, this time by the American army. In the latter year the screenings took place at the [[Doge\u2019s Palace]]. The festival returned o Lido in 1948. An arena for outdoors screenings was built outside the film hall. In 1949 the festival\u2019s award, which was called International Great Prize of Venice, was renamed St. Mark\u2019s Lion Prize. Later it was called the Golden Lion.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 188, 189, 191, 192</ref>\n\nThe Lido has also hosted numerous film-shoots. In 1971 the film [[Death in Venice (film)|''Death in Venice'']] <small>(''Morte a Venezia'')</small> directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]], and based on the [[Death in Venice]] novel published in 1912 by [[Thomas Mann]] was screened.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/death-venice-arthouse Death in Venice: No 14 best arthouse film of all time]</ref> Both the novel and the film were set at lido and the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], where Thomas Mann stayed with his wife and brother in the summer of 1911.

They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The  peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti|Cavallino]]/Punta Sabbioni forms the northern part and the peninsula of [[Sottomarina]] forms the southern part. The sea has access to the lagoon through three inlets between the islands and between the islands and the peninsulas. At the northern end of Lido there is the Lido inlet which separates it from Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni and at the southern end there is the Malamocco inlet which separates it from Pellestrina.<ref>[http://cigno.atlantedellalaguna.it/maps/7/view Atlas of the Lagoon]</ref> These two inlets have been dredged to a greater depth to allow big ships through. The Malamocco inlet is the deepest one and is used by container ships and oil tankers to reach the commercial and industrial port of [[Marghera]]. The Lido inlet is the widest one (c.1&nbsp;km) and is used by cruise ships to reach Venice.\n\nLido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.\n\nThe island is home to a town and a village. The town is in the north. It is also called Lido (population 15128 in 2019<ref name = portale>[https://portale.comune.venezia.it/millefoglie/statistiche/home Portale comune Venezia]</ref>). Its neighbourhoods are San Nicol\u00f2, Santa Maria Elisabetta, on the lagoon side coast (the landing stage for the Venice ferry is in the former and the one for the water bus is in the latter), and Quattro Fontane and La Favorita, on the seaward coast. It developed in the 19th century as a tourist centre, both as a leisure seaside resort and as a [[balneotherapy]] resort. It has many 19th century villas built in [[Liberty style]] (the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]) and many hotels. It is famous for being the seat of the [[Venice Film Festival]] and for its grand hotels, such as the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], the Hotel Excelsior.<ref>[https://famoushotels.org/hotels/excelsior-lido-Venice Famous hotels]</ref> and the Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria <ref>[http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/ausoniahungariavenicelido.html Historic Hotels Now]</ref> which have hosted celebrities,  artists and writers, major businessmen, politicians and royalties. The  Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (27 m wide and c. 700 m long) crosses the town from coast to coast and links the water bus landing stage to the beach.\n\nThe village of [[Malamocco]] (with a population of 1030 as of 2019)<ref name=portale/> is on the lagoon side coast, in the central-southern part of the island. From the 12th century to the 19th century it was the only significant settlement on the island. It was built after the settlement of Metamaucum, which had been the second capital of the [[Duchy of Venetia]], was submerged by a storm surge.\n\nAt the southern end of the islands there is Alberoni, an area of sand dunes. It has Venice's golf course<ref>[https://www.1golf.eu/en/club/circolo-golf-venezia/ Circolo Golf Venezia]</ref> and the Alberoni Dune Oasis which has one of the largest and best-preserved dune systems on the coasts of the Northern Adriatic Sea, with dunes up to 10 meters high, a large, c. 30 [[hectares]], pine forest and unique species of flora and fauna.<ref>[http://www.veniceandlagoon.net/web/en/itineraries/nature/alberoni-dunes-and-ca-roman/Alberoni Dunes]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Metamaucum===\n[[Malamocco|Metamaucum]] was one of the earliest settlements in the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. Its origins dated back to the Roman days. It became the second ducal seat of the [[duchy of Venetia]] (before the rise of Venice) when [[Teodato Ipato]] (742-55), the second [[doge]], transferred it from Heraclea, to 811, when the doge [[Agnello Participazio]] (811-27) moved it to Rivoalto. It was temporarily occupied by [[Pepin of Italy]] when he tried to invade the lagoon in 810. It was destroyed by the doge [[Giovanni I Participazio]] (829\u2013836) when he suppressed a rebellion based in Metamaucum. The settlement continued to be inhabited, but it was a shadow of its former self. Its decadence reached its peak when its priory was moved to the island of [[Murano]] (1080), the S.S. Leone e Basso nuns moved to the island of [[San Servolo]] (1109) and its [[dioceses]] was moved to Chioggia between 1107 and 1110. In 1116 it was submerged as a result of an exceptional storm surge. According to the tradition, Metamaucum was on the seashore of the Lido island, rather than on its lagoon shore.\n\nA new settlement was built on the lagoon shore of Lido, close to where Metamaucum had been. The existence of a Metamaucum Nova, which corresponds to today's Malamocco, was first attested in 1107.<ref>Lanfranchi, L., Zille, G.,  Il territorio del Ducato Veneziano dall'VIII al XII secolo, in  Storia di Venezia, 1958, pp. 27-28</ref>\n\n===Military island===\nUntil the 19th century Lido's main role was a military one for the defence of  the lagoon as it lies by the lido inlet, the widest point of entry of the lagoon and the one which is closest to Venice. It continued to have a military tole until WW II. Prior to the 19th century it was also a scarcely populated island. In 1820 Lido has 814 inhabitants, 662 of whom lived in Malamocco, and 152 lived in San   Nicol\u00f2.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 600 a lookout tower was built at San Nicol\u00f2, at the northern end of Lido, on its lagoon side shore, to monitor enemy ships, particularly pirate ships, approaching the lagoon at the Lido inlet. In 1100 it was strengthened and developed into a fort under the doge [[Vitale I Michiel]] (1096-1102). This fort was later called Castel Vecchio (Old Castle).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1229 crossbow shooting ranges were created in areas of Venice for weekly exercises by men between the ages of 16 and 35. In 1229 a shooting range was established at San Nicol\u00f2. It hosted shooting contests at Christmas and Easter to make the exercises more interesting. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery units were also stationed in the area and foundries for armaments and munitions were built where the Jewish cemetery was later set up. In 1304 a militia was instituted. The sailing to Lido was also turned into a contest. The men rowed to the island on boats (called ganzaruoli) with 30-40 oarsmen boats which competed over who would get there first. This is the origin of the word regatta. The only establishment that sold wine at San Nicol\u00f2 was closed during the contests. A lighthouse was also built close to the shooting range. A permanent garrison was set up.  It served as rest area for troops which needed to briefly stop by. Wells to supply freshwater to ships that left the city were built.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 60, 64-65</ref>\n\nIn the mid-14th century tensions between Venice and the [[Republic of Genoa]] escalated due to their rivalry over supremacy of the naval routes and trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean . 1318. San Nicol\u00f2 was bombed several times by a Genoese fleet.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 62</ref>\n\nIn 1335 the Gagiandra (turtle in Venetian) was built. It was a platform for artillery which was placed in the Lido channel which went from the Lido inlet to Venice. It was broad and tapered at the stern and bow. It was covered by a metal plate which acted  as a shield. The canons were sticking out of this shield. This gave it the appearance of the head, tail and legs of a turtle. The platform was placed between the Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) at San Nicol\u00f2 and the Castel Novo (New Castle) on the [[Vignole]] island. These two islands and the island of Certosa formed the shores of the channel. An iron chain was placed across the channel. It was supported by the Gagiandra and two rafts placed midway between the \"turtle\" and the two shores. The chain was kept close to the surface of the water to prevent enemy ships to pass above it.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn 1379 Genoa attacked the lagoon in the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). Two towers were built as platforms for crossbows and cannons at the Castel Vecchio and Novo forts (on the Lido and Vignole islands) on the two sides of the Lido channel, to further protect the entrance to the lagoon. Small boats which were chained together were placed between the two towers. Between them there were three ships with archers covered with fresh hides to protect them from fire. A ditch and earthen rampant strengthened with stone were created to protect the S. Nicol\u00f3 abbey. Eventually Venice won the war.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 66-6</ref>\n\nIn 1409 an admiralty was established at S. Nicol\u00f2. 1520 The [[Council of Ten]] build a building to house its offices and barracks for its officers who were entrusted with monitoring Lido, its fortresses, its inlet and the way the sea changed its beaches. This was called the Casa Rossa (Red House).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp.70, 78</ref>\n \nIn the 16th century, with the Turkish conquests in south-eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, which were a threat to the Venetian dominion in that part of the Mediterranean the Turks were also considered a threat to Venice itself.\n\nBetween 1543 and 1549 Castel Novo, on the Vignole island, was developed into the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. Between 1546 and 1574 Castel Novo at San Nicol\u00f2 was developed into the San Nicol\u00f2 fort. Between 1569 and 1574 the latter was strengthened with a triple ditch. Artillery was placed on the seaward side. There were no batteries on the lagoon side in case the fortress was seized and the cannons would be used against the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. The fort became a complex with the military headquarter of the [[Republic of Venice]]. The whole area became a c. 521 m long fortified citadel stretching along the lagoon coast with brick barriers and bastions, a dike and an earthen fore wall. It was later was extended towards the sea with angular barriers, six gates and underground exits on the sea beach side, towards the entrance to the Lido inlet. Inside the new fortification there were the old San Nicol\u00f2 church and its convent and the adjacent Palazzo dei dieci/Casa Rossa at the back. In 1572 an Istrian stone bridge that looked like a triumphal arch over the dock was built to provide access to the citadel.\n\nLarge barracks for the troops, known as Saraglio, Quartier Grando or Palazzo dei Soldati (Stronghold, Large Quarters or Building of the Soldiers) were built between 1591 and 1594. It was an imposing building which provided lodgings for 2000 soldiers. It was the first true barracks in Europe, the first instance in which troops were lodged in peacetime. It was an important step towards the creation of a modern army as opposed to a mercenary army or a militia. It was built on the location where the crusaders had gathered before setting off for the fourth crusade. From 1600 the barracks hosted the Fanti da Mar (Infantrymen of the Sea), the first amphibian troops in history, a sort of precursor of today\u2019s marines.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28-29, 83-84</ref>\n\nIn 1571 it was decided to build octagonal forts for artillery batteries on islets off the lagoon side shore of Lido. They were the Ottagono Campana (later called Abbandonato, abandoned octagon),  between Malamocco and Alberoni (off the southern end of the Lido island) and the Ottagono Alberoni, by Alberoni and the northern end of the Malamocco inlet, the other point of access into the lagoon, where ships could turn towards Venice. The Ottagono di Poveglia (further north, on the Poveglia island, off Malamocco) acted as a reinforcement for the other two octagons further south. Two octagons were built off the [[Pellestrina]] island, the Ottagono San Pietro, at the northern end of the island and the southern end of the Malamocco inlet and the Ottagono Caroman, at the southern end of Pellestrina to guard the Chioggia inlet, the third entry point of the lagoon. In 1572, 75 artillery were supplied for the San Nicol\u00f2 fort and 56 for Sant\u2019Andrea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 83-84</ref>\n\nSan Nicol\u00f2 was also where the soldiers and the ships for Venice\u2019s naval expeditions in the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea gathered and set off from. Some of these were:\n\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. In 1099, 207 ships set off at the end of the first crusade to help the crusaders to consolidate their conquests. It defeated a fleet of their Genoese rivals off [[Rhodes]]. In 1124 a fleet sets off to free the [[King of Jerusalem]] who had been imprisoned in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Lebanon]]. It had 108 vessels, 40 galleys 40 supply ships and 28 ships with rams. It besieged and seized Tyre. In 1171 A fleet set off for a battle against the emperor Byzantine Emmanuel Kommenos who had the Venetians in Constantinople arrested. The fleet was defeated more by the plague that the Byzantines, who were was joined by the rival maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]. In 1202 the crusaders of the fourth crusade gathered at Lido in preparation to be taken to the East by Venetian ships. In 1690 Francesco Morosini set off for a campaign in the Peloponnese. He was elected as doge while away. He was met at Lido by the abbot while the senators waited for him of the Bucintoro, the ceremonial boat of the doge. In 1784 there was a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 50, 54, 55, 58, 94, 100</ref>\n\n===Pope, emperor and the Peace of Venice===\nThe emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I, Barbarossa]] (reigned 1155-1190) conducted six military campaigns in Italy, which was under his [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Originally he wanted to confront the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the south. However, his intervention in Italy was opposed by several Italian cities, particularly [[Milan]], which he had partially destroyed during his second campaign. A dispute with [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159-1181) developed because Frederick endorsed [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|antipope Victor IV]], who had been elected in opposition to Alexander. Opposition against Frederick in northern Italy grew and the [[Lombard League]], a league formed by several cities, fought him. Frederick was defeated at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176. Preliminary peace negotiations took place at [[Anagni]] (the Peace of Anagni) in 1176.<ref>Davis, R. H. C. A History of Medieval Europe, 1957, p.332 et seq.</ref>  Negotiations involving all the concerned parties to reach a formal peace treaty took place in Venice where a conference was scheduled for July 1177. The [[doge]] [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u201378) was to act as an intermediary.\n\nThe pope arrived in Venice in 10 May 1177. Negotiations with the Lombard League and the king of Sicily started but they were taking a hard stance. Frederick was not allowed to go to Venice and waited for news in Ravenna. A pro-Frederick faction in Venice encouraged Frederick to come to Venice in defiance of the veto, but the emperor declined to do so without the doge\u2019s approval. Because of internal pressure, Ziani hesitated. The envoys of the League left Venice for [[Treviso]] in protest. The head of the Sicilian delegation threatened to leave and said that his king would take revenge on Venice breach of faith. This would have meant retaliation against Venetian traders in Sicily. The doge confirmed that Frederick would be allowed to enter Venice only after this received papal approval.\n\nThis situation highlighted the danger of a breakdown in the talks and negotiations proceeded more rapidly. On 23 July the agreement was completed. At the pope request, Venetian ships went to [[Chioggia]] to pick up the emperor, who was taken to Lido. Four cardinals went there to meet him there. Frederick recognised Alexander as the rightful pope and could now be allowed to enter Venice. Doge Ziani went to meet him at San Nicol\u00f2 and took him to Venice with great pomp. A ceremony was held at St. Mark\u2019s basilica.<ref>Norwich, J. J., A History of Venice, 2003, pp. 111-16</ref>\n\n===The Wedding to the Sea===\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. Istria and Dalmatia accepted Venice's [[suzerainty]]. To celebrate this the Venetians celebrated with the ''Benedictio del Mare'' (Blessing of the Sea) ceremony,  which was held annually until 1177. In that year, after Venice's mediation which led to the Peace of Venice, it was replaced by the ''Sposalizio col Mare'' (Wedding with the Sea) .\n\nIn this ceremony the doge sailed for Lido on the bucintoro (the doge's ceremonial ship) with the top clergy, the top officials of the [[Republic of Venice]] and ambassadors. This was followed by a  large number of Venetians on various kinds of vessels. It was a festive parade. Between Lido and the Sant'Andrea fort (see above), where the [[Lagoon of Venice]] meets the [[Adriatic Sea]], the doge took a golden ring which pope Alexander III had donated him. He then threw it into the sea. It was attached to a string so that it can be retrieved. The doge then recited \"We marry thee, oh sea, in a sign of eternal domination.\" The ceremony ended in 1797 when the Republic fell with its conquest by Napoleon. It was performed on the first Sunday after [[ascension day]].\n\nThe ceremony and [[f\u00eate]] was performed again in 1965 and in 1988. The latter was an initiative by private citizens and cultural and sport associations which wanted to relaunch the celebrations.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 55-56, 202, 215</ref> The ceremony became permanent and is now led by the mayor of Venice\n\nThe ceremony was also associated with the ''Festa della Sensa'' (F\u00eate of Ascension). In 1180 it developed into the ''Fiera della Sensa'' (Ascension [[Fair]]). There were acrobats, jugglers and minstrels in all the streets of Venice. There was a large market in [[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]]. From 1307 the market had especially prepared stands which over time became increasingly decoratively elaborate. Goods of all kinds and from all over the world were displayed.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 56</ref>\n\n===Murazzi===\nThe engineer Bernardo Zendrini found that [[pozzolana]] mixed with chalk and sand was an efficient water-resistant binder. In 1737 he built a 2.5 m long test wall near Malamocco. Three years later it had withstood two winter storm surges (one of which had been one of the worst) without damage. This led to the building of the murazzi, imposing walls made with large blocks of [[Istrian stone]] to form a continuous sea defence on the barrier island of Pellestrina. Later murazzi were built at Lido as well, but here they were discontinuous. A previously unknown 350 m long test wall brought was to light by the seaward shore in 1980. It lies 380 from the sea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 97</ref> This is because after the construction of the breakwater at San Nicol\u00f2 (see below), sand has been accumulating on the sea shore in the northern part of the island, widening the beach.\n\n===Churches, monasteries convents and saints===\nIn 887 the male Benedictine monastery of  San Cipriano was founded in Malamocco on the initiative of doge [[Giovanni II Participazio]]. This was followed by the female monastery of Santi Leone and Basso. In 1108 San Cipriano was abandoned due to damage caused by the sea and daily ground collapses. The friars moved to the [[Murano]] island and set up a new monastery of S. Cipriano. In 1109, for the same reason, the nuns moved to a convent on the [[San Servolo]] island vacated by Benedictine monks who had moved to the monastery of Sant'Ilario near Fusina.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 42, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1045 the doge Domenico Contarini I (1043\u201371), the [[Patriarch of Grado]] and the bishop of  Olivolo founded the church and convent of San Nicol\u00f2. The works for the church  were completed in 1064. In 1053, the management of the church and convent was handed to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. In 1098 some of relics three of saints from [[Myra]] (now [[Demre]]), west of the [[Chelidonia (islands)|Chelidonia]] cape, [[Lydia]], on the southern coast of what is now [[Turkey]], were smuggled by a naval squadron which returned form the first crusade and placed in the San Nicol\u00f2 church. The saints were  Nicol\u00f2 Major, his uncle Nicol\u00f2 Minor and Theodoros. The church, which was small, was enlarged in 1134 and urns with the relics were moved from the crypt and put in three niches by the main altar. Between 1626 and 1634 the church was demolished and rebuilt, together with the bell tower, using material from the old church. In 1770 the Benedictines moved to San Giorgio Maggiore island because a 1768 law closed confraternities with less than 12 monks or friars. The building became a military quarter. The church remained open for worship. In 1938 it was granted to Franciscan friars.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46-50, 52, 62, 90-91, 100, 187</ref>\n\nThe first record of the Abbey of San Leonardo between Alberoni and Malamocco dates to 1111. It was destroyed by fire, along with the whole of the Malamocco coast, during the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). In 1407 there was a bequest for the rebuilding of the monastery. The church was rebuilt with funds from the [[patriarch of Venice]]. The church merged with the San Camillo hospital in 1928 and was demolished to enlarge the hospital.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 53-54</ref>\n\nIn 1557 the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta church in Malamocco was rebuilt on top of old one, which dated to the 11th century.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 81</ref>\n\nIn 1620 there was a request to build a church at Lido to replace the unauthorised oratory of Beata Vergine Visitante Santa Elisabetta (Blessed Visiting Virgin St. Elizabeth) to the south of San Nicol\u00f2, which was built by the locals because they found it difficult to reach their parish church of [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] on the island with the same name.\nIn 1627 the construction of the new church, now called Santa Maria Elisabetta, on top of the old oratory was completed. The patriarch of Venice granted it the title of parish church. It was the second parish church of Lido, after Santa Maria Assunta in Malamocco. In 19th century, when the area became built up, it was named after this church.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 88-91</ref>\n\n===Jewish and protestant cemeteries===\nIn 1386 the Jews were granted a plot of uncultivated land to develop the Jewish cemetery. The friars of the San Nicol\u00f2 convent were opposed to this and claimed that they owned the land. A few years later to resolve this, the Jews paid a token rent. Consent was given and burials started in 1389. A Protestant cemetery was opened close to the Jewish one in 1674.  A very small catholic cemetery was opened in 1866 in front of the entrance of the Jewish one. In 1916 it was replaced by a new one. A new Jewish cemetery was also built. Its monumental  entrance was completed in 1923. As a result, the Catholic cemetery lies between the old and new Jewish cemeteries.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 67-68, 94, 157, 168</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe accumulation of sand carried by the sea at the Malamocco and Lido inlets made their navigability problematic. During second Napoleonic occupation (1806\u201314), it was decided to build breakwaters on the southern and northern shore of the Malamocco inlet. The latter was to be built at Alberoni, on the southern tip of Lido. However, the works were not completed due to the second Austrian occupation (1814\u201348). The Austrians disagreed with the French plans. The project was entrusted to the engineer Pietro Paleocapa. Works at Alberoni started in 1838 and were completed in 1845. Works on the southern breakwater at Santa Maria del Mare, on the [[Pellestrina]] island, started in 1853 and were completed in 1856. The object of the northern breakwater to keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carried. That of the southern one was to channel the receding low tide water to make the inlet deeper through the force of the exit current.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 107-8, 115, 116, 118</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century and in the 19th century, a number of poets and writers wrote about Lido. This made Lido an attractive destination for people from the European elites in their then fashionable  journeys in Italy.  In 1786 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the German poet and scientist, visited Lido and wrote about his experience there in this book about his journey in Italy. [[Lord Byron]] spent five years (1816\u201321) in Venice and liked to ride his horses at Lido from a hut he rented at Alberoni. In 1818 he was visited by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The two spent a couple of days at Lido. Shelley wrote a poem about this. Since Byron was a celebrity, this attracted tourists who hoped to meet the poet or get a glimpse of him at Lido.<ref>Saikia, R., The Venice Lido: A Blue Guide Travel Monograph (e-Edition), ch.4</ref> In 1830 [[James Fenimore Cooper]], the author of [[The Last of the Mohicans]], visited and described Lido and used Venice as the background for his novel [[The Bravo]]. In 1841 [[John Ruskin]], the art critic who wrote about Venice and her art, also wrote about Lido. Other people who visited Lido and described it were and the French poet [[Theophile Gautier]], in 1850, [[Herman Melville]], the American novelist and poet, in 1857, and [[Hyppolyte Taine]], the French critic and historian, in 1864. Henry James first arrived in Venice in 1869. He went to Lido 14 times. He wrote about Venice in some of his novels and one of them was set in Venice. The British poet and playwright [[Robert Browning]] went to Lido in 1888 and died in Venice nearly two months later.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 101-2, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 123, 132</ref>\n\n[[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Frederick William]], the [[Duke of Brunswick]] (1771-1815) bought a plot of land at Lido, intending it to have his holiday home there. From 1879 queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] took her sickly son [[Victor Emmanuel III]], the heir to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on holiday at Lido, at the [[sea bathing]] facility of La Favorita. A royal chalet was arranged for her.<ref>Farina F., Architetture balneari tra Europa e Americhe nella Belle \u00e9poque, 2001, p. 10</ref>  In those days there was the belief that sea bathing had a curative or therapeutic value.\n\nTommaso Rima, a doctor at Venice\u2019s hospital, believed that bathing in the lagoon had therapeutic benefits for nervous illnesses, scrofulosis,<ref>A form of tuberculosis, most common in children, tending to cause enlarged and degenerated lymph nodes, especially in the neck, and often chronic, intractable skin inflammation as well, Wiktionary</ref> rickets and skin disorders. In 1833 he set up a floating bathing facility  at [[Punta della Dogana]], opposite [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark\u2019s]]. It consisted of two big rafts which created a pool with a grate at the bottom and which could be reassembled in the summer. There was a caf\u00e9 and one could sunbathe. The idea of bathing therapy caught on. Gondolas were adapted for the purpose and inns set up pools with water drawn for the nearby canals which was warmed up. There was an idea that this kind of bathing in the Venetian winter was particularly therapeutic. In 1857 a booklet about this notion published.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 114-15</ref>\n\nThe Lido\u2019s potential for tourism did not go unnoticed. In 1852 there was a proposal to set up two [[spa]]s, one on the lagoon shore and one on the sea shore, but it was then thought that the lagoon water was less pure. In 1855 De la Hante, a Frenchman, set up a bathing resort in the La Favorita area, which was named after the villa of the [[archduke Maximillian of Austria]] (1832-1867) the brother of the emperor who was in charge of the Austrian dominions in northern Italy (1815\u201359) and spent some of his time in Venice. The resort had 70 rooms. In 1872 De la Hante bought the archduke\u2019s villa to convert it into a restaurant, caf\u00e9, casino and 70 rooms for an exclusive beach resort. However, he then sold it to the Lido Bathing Resort Society (see below).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 118, 124</ref>\n\nIn 1857 Giovanni Busetto, nicknamed Fisola, also opened a seaside resort. This consisted of wooden cabins on pilings over the beach with a common central area and two wings with 15 small rooms each. Separate cabins for the lower classes were planned. It was demolished by the Austrians in 1859 due to the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against Austrian domination in northern Italy. In 1867, after Venice became part of Italy, the resort was reopened and expanded but was destroyed by a storm surge. It was reopened and expanded again in 1870. From 1867 to 1871 the number of bathers increased from 30 to 60 thousand.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 118-19</ref>\n\nIn 1857 a summer shuttle service to and from Venice was set up. It consisted of large boats with four oarsmen which could carry 16 passengers. In 1858 the road from the church of Santa Maria Elisabetta, which was by the landing stage in the lagoon coast and lead to the seacoast, was widened and made suitable for vehicle traffic. It eventually came to be called Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (or just Gran Viale). It was widened again in 1888 and a horse-drawn [[Horsebus|omnibus]] which took tourists to the beach along the Gran Viale entered into service. In the same year the military steamship Alnoch, which could carry up to 200 passengers, was made available for linking Lido with Venice during the tourist season from 6 am to 9 pm. This was then extended to 4 am to 11 pm.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119-20</ref>\n\nIn 1872 a group of entrepreneurs set up the ''Societ\u00e0 Civile dei Bagni di Lido'' (the Lido Bathing Resort Society). Its aim was to boost Lido's tourism potential. It bought the La Favorita villa, it reduced the number of its room to six to be used by queen Margaret. A large terrace which overlooked the sea was built. It could host 1500 people and had salons, caf\u00e9-restaurants, reading rooms and ballrooms, a telegraph and post office, medical assistance, a chemist and life guards with special lookout posts and boats. The group also wanted to promote sea bathing as a leisure activity as well as a therapeutic one. This idea was expounded by Paolo Mantegazza, a doctor who wrote about beaches and the sea as collective salons where people could rest and have fun.\n\nThe group planned more resorts and the urban development of the area between the landing stage of the lagoon side and the sea beach. This area came to be called Santa Maria Elisabetta. The project involved substantial land improvements and drainage on an island which was still largely rural and had areas of bog land and scattered dunes. A water drainage and sewer system was developed. The development was to have hospitality and entertainment facilities, residential areas, roads, gardens, woods, restaurants and cafes. Villas for wealthy bathers were built in Liberty style, the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]. The number of bathers increased from 60,000 in 1871 to 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.The number of small rooms for bathers increased to 600. They were equipped with facilities for seawater therapy with the spraying of rarefied water with compressed air.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119, 124-25</ref>\n\nIn 1873 a steam navigation company was established. This was the birth of the Venetian waterbus, the service for the  transport of people around the lagoon. It used steamboats which were smaller than the military one which had been used and thus allowed more frequent journeys. With regard to Lido, compared to oar boats, it shortened the time needed to reach Santa Maria Elisabetta from San Zaccaria (near St Mark's Square) dramatically, from one hour to ten minutes. In 1881 a regular time table with services every half an hour between 6 am and 12 pm was introduced. It entered into operation in 1882. In 1898 the Municipality of Venice took over the Grand Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta and widened it to 17 m to allow for a single-track horse-drawn tramway. The Bathing Resort Society was given permission to set this up in 1889 s up. It replaced the omnibus.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 126-27</ref>\n\n1885 a low-cost bathing resort for the lower classes with 150 small rooms was established. In 1887 and 1888 the bathing resort was expanded again and an electricity power plant was built. The first beach huts were installed for bathing and for \"air sunlight and sand\" therapy, which was popular among families. This development required the construction of a seafront boulevard. Further urbanisation took place and more villas were built. In 1889 an electric tramway line along the Gran Viale was introduced and from 1892 the Gran Viale had electric lighting during the tourist season. The number of tourists increased from 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 130, 32, 33</ref>\n\nThe Ospizio Marino (Sea Nursing Home) opened in 1870. It was a hospital for poor children who suffered from scrofulosis, which affected especially children form deprived backgrounds, who needed [[heliotherapy]]. Experiments conducted in 1842 indicated that what was then called sea therapy was the required treatment. The hospital had 200 beds. It was expanded to 500 beds in 1873. After the opening of the Excelsior Hotel in 1908 it was planned to move the hospital elsewhere to make room next to the hotel and to move the sick away from it. This occurred in the 1920s.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-47</ref>\n\nThe lido inlet had not used for navigation since 1724 because this was prevented by frequent sand accumulation. In 1866 the engineer Pietro Paleocapa submitted a plan to build two breakwaters to reopen the inlet, one on its northern shore (Punta Sabbioni) and the other on its southern shore (San Nicol\u00f2). They were to be 3,5&nbsp;km and 2.85&nbsp;km long respectively, extend in the direction of the [[Sirocco|Scirocco]] wind, give the inlet a width of 1&nbsp;km and reach a depth of 8 m. In 1870 studies showed that similar works on the Malamocco inlet has been effective in preventing sand accumulation and that the sand was stopped by the northern breakwater. It accumulated by it. The project was approved in 1871. The works started in 1882. The San Nicol\u00f2 breakwater was the first that was built. The works on both was completed in 1910 with the construction of a 26 m high lighthouse at Punta Sabbioni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 122-23, 125, 126, 127</ref>\n\nA theatre (Nuovo Teatro del Lido) which had 600 seats opened in 1892. A [[velodrome]] was opened in 1894, but cycling competitions were ended in 1896 due to high running costs. In 1911 it hosted period costume equestrian tournament which attracted a big crowd.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 133-34, 150</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe expansion of the bathing resorts and of the urbanisation of the Santa Maria Elisabetta area continued. From 1900 to 1920 some 50 villas were built. In 1904 a horse-riding school was established. Over the decades it held several international contests and two world cups. The planning for a boulevard to connect Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta to San Nicol\u00f2 started in 1905. An aquarium was opened next to the theatre in 1909. Both were later demolished.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 139, 140, 148</ref>\n\nLido also became an island of grand hotels. The Grand Hotel Lido, in Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta, the square in front of the landing stage, was opened in 1900. It was demolished in the 1970s. In the same year the famous [[Grand Hotel des Bains]] was opened.<ref>http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/bainsvenicelido.html Historic Hotels - Hotel des Bains</ref> The Hungaria Palace Hotel, later called Grand Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria, opened in 1907. It had 82 rooms furnished by Eugenio Quarti, a famous Milan furniture maker nicknamed prince of the ''ebanisti'' (carpenters who work with ebony). A [[maiolica]] [[mosaic]] with Renaissance motifs interpreted in liberty style \nwhich made the hotel very distinctive was installed on its facade between 1914 and 1916.<ref>Speziali A., Diletto e armonia.

Two flights from Venice to this beach were arranged later in the year. The last one attracted many people who paid tickets to get on the terrace of the hotel and crowded it. There was a lottery draw whose prize was a tour on the plane. More such flights were then organised. This helped to attract attention to the hotel. In 1914 the owner of the Excelsior opened a fun fair which was extremely successful. However, it was dismantled the next year because of WW I. Another one was opened in 1932 but it suffered the same fate because of WW II.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 149-50, 152-53, 181-82</ref>\n\nIn 1919 woks started on a staircase to a votive temple (built between 1925 and 1928) dedicated to the Madonna of Victory and built for the remembrance of the fallen soldiers of WW I. The bodies of 3700 soldiers are kept here.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 159-60</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s seaplanes became the next technological advance. A Frenchman organised an international competition, the Schneider International Cup, from 1920 to 1931. It was held at Lido in 1920, 1921 and 1927. It was extremely popular.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 161</ref>\n\nIn 1919 it was decided that the ''Ospizio Marino'' (see above) was to remain open permanently and not just in the summer. Between 1922 and 1926 a new site for the hospital was built in the La Favorita area. It was now opened to adults as well. The centre for rehabilitation for children with rickets merged with this hospital in 1924. The Ospizio developed [[balneotherapy]] (bathing therapy) psammotherapy (hot sand baths) and sun therapy. In 1933 it was renamed ''Ospedale al Mare'' (Hospital at the Sea). It became a hospital of specialised excellence and the foremost [[thalassotherapy]] (the use of seawater for therapy) centre in Italy. In 1933 a church was opened in this complex.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-24, 167-8, 182</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the Grand Hotel Company (CIGA) built a bagno popolare (low-cost bathing resort) and gave the municipality a large square to create a public playground. In 1923 another bagno popolare (later called zone A) was established next to the Ospizio Marino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 161, 169</ref>\n\nThe Nicelli airport was developed during WW I for the defence of Venice. In 1926 it was converted to civilian use with the construction of a terminal. The first light was to Vienna and carried four passengers. By 1931 there were six routes. In 1935 a second terminal was built. By 1939 there were 23,285 passengers. The major European airlines operated here and the airport was the second most important one in Italy after Rome. During  WW II much of its equipment was confiscated by the Germans, who also tried to destroy it. Operations resumed after the war. However, with the advent of bigger jet planes, the runway became too short. In 1961 the new [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]] was opened. The Nicelli airport only handled small private planes and hosted a school for pilots and parachutists. In 1994 the municipality of Venice set up a management firm to the restore the airport and relaunch economic activity in the area.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 173-75, 221</ref>\n\nIn 1930 the golf course at Alberoni was inaugurated. It was said that [[Henry Ford]] had been disappointed that Lido did not have a golf course. The area at the southern end of the island, which had sand dunes (sand would provide good drainage), trees and a former military fort and stables was chosen. Originally it had 9 holes. It was extended to 18 holes in 1951. The course is 6&nbsp;km long. It hosted Italian opens in 1955, 1960 and 1974.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 178-79</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 June 1934 Hitler went to Venice to meet Mussolini. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Venice and Mussolini stayed at the Grand Hotel Excelsior. The two men met at the golf club at Alberoni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 182</ref>\n\nVenice was the first city in the world to have a publicly owned and regulated casino. It opened in 1638. However, it was closed in 1774. In 1938 the casino (Palazzo del Casin\u00f2) at Lido was opened. This marked the return of legal gambling in Venice. It became a summer casino in 1946, when a winter venue was opened in Venice in what is now Ca\u2019 Vendramin Calergi, formerly the last residence of Richard Wagner, who died there. The Palazzo del Casin\u00f2 at Lido was closed in the 1990s when a new casino was opened at Ca\u2019 Noghera in the mainland.<ref>https://casino.gioconews.it/cronaca/40599-una-serenissima-casa-da-gioco Casa da Gioco</ref><ref>http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/venezia/da-vedere/monumento/ex-casin\u00f2-del-lido-5776 Ex casin\u00f2 del Lido</ref>\n\nIn 1946 and 1947 a motor race was held at the Lido circuit to relaunch tourism. [[Tazio Nuvolari]] came third in the second race. Lido hosted the road cycling world championship in 1952 and track cycling world championship in 1962. In the latter year the ice rink was opened. Prior to that the rich skated at an inner terrace of the Excelsior Hotel and the non-rich skated at a small garden by the casino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 191-2, 193-94</ref> \n \nIn the 1960s, the improving post-war Italian economy created a real-estate boom in the island and many Venetians moved to Lido to benefit from its modern infrastructure.\n\n== The Venice Film Festival ==\n{{main | Venice Film Festival}}\n[[File:66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) Palais du Cinema.jpg|thumb|253x253px| [[66th Venice International Film Festival|66th Venice Int. Film Festival]] on the Lido.]]\n\nLido di Venezia is home to the [[Venice International Film Festival]] <small>([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia'', \"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the [[Venice Biennale]]</small>\"). It is the world's oldest film festival and one of the three most prestigious ones, together with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>Anheier, H.K., Juergensmeyer M., eds., Encyclopedia of Global Studies, 2012, p. 566. Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014still hold the most prestigious status as cultural institutions that officially endorse the aesthetic and cinematic values of movies and critical currencies of film directors.</ref> These are sometimes called the \"Big Three\".<ref>Bordwell, D. (2005). Figures Traced in Light: On Cinematic Staging, 2005, p. 144. Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice).</ref>\n\nThe film festival started in 1932. It was the idea of the then chair of the [[Venice Biennale]] who was worried about a decline in tourism at Lido due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and understood that cinema could help to alleviate this. It was successful. The prince [[Umberto di Savoia]], the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Henry Ford]] and film stars such as [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Clark Gable]] attended. Forty films form six countries were shown on the terrace of the Excelsior hotel. No awards were given, but an audience referendum chose which films and performances were the most praiseworthy.\n\nThe second festival was held in 1934. It was meant to be a biennial event but it became annual because of the success of the first one. There were some 20 awards, but there was no jury. Premiers were shown, which increased the prestige of the festival. So did a scandal caused by a [[Gustav Machaty]]'s [[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]] which showed the first scenes with a female nude in cinema history, which also launched the career of the actress [[Hedy Lamarr|Hedy Lammarr]]. This time the films were shown in the garden of the Excelsior hotel. In 1937 the venue of the festival was opened. It is the Palazzo del Cinema.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 180, 182-83, 185</ref>\n\nIn 1939 the fascist government imposed the assignation of the awards to two propaganda films, a fascist one and a Nazi one. Because of this the Americans boycotted the 1940 festival. The 1940-41-42 editions are not listed as part of the festival because the government assumed total control of the screening of films and chose films from the \u201cRome-Berlin\u201d axis. These festival were screened at two cinemas in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned. In 1943-45 the festival was suspended because of the war. It resumed in 1946. However, the French wanted their new festival, the  [[Cannes Film Festival]], to start at the same time as he Venice one. After negotiations it was decided that Cannes would run in the spring and Venice would start later, in late August. In 1946 and 1947 the festival was held in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned, this time by the American army. In the latter year the screenings took place at the [[Doge\u2019s Palace]]. The festival returned o Lido in 1948. An arena for outdoors screenings was built outside the film hall. In 1949 the festival\u2019s award, which was called International Great Prize of Venice, was renamed St. Mark\u2019s Lion Prize. Later it was called the Golden Lion.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 188, 189, 191, 192</ref>\n\nThe Lido has also hosted numerous film-shoots. In 1971 the film [[Death in Venice (film)|''Death in Venice'']] <small>(''Morte a Venezia'')</small> directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]], and based on the [[Death in Venice]] novel published in 1912 by [[Thomas Mann]] was screened.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/death-venice-arthouse Death in Venice: No 14 best arthouse film of all time]</ref> Both the novel and the film were set at lido and the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], where Thomas Mann stayed with his wife and brother in the summer of 1911.  The novel was also turned into the [[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice opera]] by Benjamin Britten (his last opera) in 1973 and a ballet by John Neumeier in 2003.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/arts/dance/09hamb.html Thomas Mann Dances to the Strains of Bach and Wagner]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe term [[Lido]], which originates from this island, forms the first part of the name of many seaside resorts in Italy and is used to refer to certain types of outdoor swimming pools, especially in [[Great Britain]]. It also the origin of the name \"Lido deck\" on a [[cruise ship]].\n\nThe British travel writer [[Robin Saikia]] has written a literary history, ''The Venice Lido'', which covers aspects of the island's history from its early days to the present day, published by [http://blueguides.com/all/?display=book&key=205 Blue Guides].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:A view of Piazzale S.M.

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics. It received a second installment, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', months later, which followed the same mashup format, and a third installment in ''[[Mouth Moods]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"When I decided to mash up Smash Mouth with John Lennon, of course I was thinking, \u2018This is super blasphemous, this is designed to make people angry.\u2019\"\n| source = \u2014Neil Cicierega explains his thinking behind the creation of the track \"Imagine All Star People\"<ref name=fast />\n| width  = 23%\n| align  = left\n| style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nCicierega began work on the album after discovering multiple raw instrument tracks from songs featured on the [[music video game]] series ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref name=fast /> Because ''Rock Band'' requires players to control individual instruments for each track, all artists featured in ''Rock Band'' must provide the [[Stem (audio)|stems]] of each song featured in the game.

The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video|music video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]].

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics.

With access to these tracks, Cicierega was able to create mashups of the provided songs. The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]].

He wrote several plays for Kate Putnam, ''American King'' for James O'Neill and ''The Little Maverick'' for Maggie Mitchell. His greatest success, ''[[In Old Kentucky (play)|In Old Kentucky]]'', was written for Jacob Litt. For over 26 years it had uninterrupted production in America. After writing for Broadway, he wrote for film including ''Manhattan Madness'' for [[Douglas Fairbanks]], ''The Mysterious Client'' for Mrs. [[Vernon Castle]] and ''Shifting Sands'' for [[Gloria Swanson]].\n\nHe was a member of the Lambs Club in New York. He married the actress Lucy Harding and died February 9, 1938 in [[Quincy, Illinois]].  He donated the land used to build [[Dazey, North Dakota]], which was named in his honor.

The bishop is [[Ivar Braut]], who has held the post since 2017.\n\n==History==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger was established in the 12th century (either 1112 or maybe 1125) when it was separated from the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]]. Initially, the large diocese covered the (modern) counties of [[Rogaland]], [[Aust-Agder]], and [[Vest-Agder]] as well as the regions of [[Valdres]] (in [[Oppland]] county), [[Hallingdal]] (in [[Buskerud]] county), and the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]] (in [[Hordaland]] county).  After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Diocese of Stavanger continued in the new [[Church of Norway]].<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOver time, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established Diocese of Stavanger and the cathedral in Stavanger regained its place as the seat of a bishop.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Bishops of Stavanger==\n\n===Catholic (12th century-Reformation)===\n{{Main|Ancient Diocese of Stavanger}}\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Reinald, Bishop of Stavanger|Reinald]] ca. 1112\u20131135\n* [[Jon Birgersson]], 1135\u20131152\n* [[Peter, Bishop of Stavanger|Peter]], 1152\u2013??\n* [[Amund, Bishop of Stavanger|Amund]], ??\u20131171\n* [[Eirik Ivarsson]], 1171\u20131188\n* [[Nj\u00e5l, Bishop of Stavanger|Nj\u00e5l]], 1189/90\u20131207\n* [[Henrik, Bishop of Stavanger|Henrik]], 1207\u20131224\n* [[Askell Jonsson]], 1226\u20131254\n* [[Torgils, Bishop of Stavanger|Torgils]], 1255\u20131276\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Arne, Bishop of Stavanger|Arne]], 1277\u20131303\n* [[Ketil, Bishop of Stavanger|Ketil]], 1304\u20131317\n* [[H\u00e5kon Halldorsson]], 1318\u20131322\n* [[Eirik Ogmundsson]], 1322\u20131342\n* [[Guttorm P\u00e5lsson]], 1343\u20131350\n* [[Sigfrid, Bishop of Stavanger|Sigfrid]], 1351\u20131352\n* [[Gyrd Aslason]], 1354\u20131355\n* [[Bottolf Asbj\u00f8rnsson]], 1355\u20131380\n* [[Hallgeirr Osmundsson]], 1380/81\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Olaf, Bishop of Stavanger|Olaf]], 1381/82\u20131398/1400\n* [[H\u00e5kon Ivarsson]], 1400\u20131426\n* [[Audun Eyvindsson]], 1427\u20131445\n* [[Gunnar Eriksson, Bishop of Stavanger|Gunnar Eriksson]], 1445\u20131451/53\n* [[Sigurd Bj\u00f8rnsson]], 1454\u20131463\n* [[Alv Thorgardsson]], 1464\u20131478\n* [[Eiliv Jonsson]], 1481\u20131512\n* [[Hoskuld Hoskuldsson]], 1513\u20131537\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (Reformation\u20131682)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jon Guttormsen]], 1541\u20131557\n* [[Jens Gregersen Riber]], 1558\u20131571\n* [[J\u00f8rgen Eriksen]], 1571\u20131604\n* [[Laurits Clausen Scabo]], 1605\u20131626\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Tomas Cortsen Wegner]], 1627\u20131654\n* [[Markus Christensen Humble]], 1655\u20131661\n* [[Christen Madsen Tausan]], 1661\u20131680\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (1925\u2013present)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jacob Christian Petersen]], 1925\u20131940\n* [[Gabriel Skagestad]], 1940\u20131949\n* [[Karl Martinussen]], 1949\u20131960\n* [[Fritjov S\u00f8iland Birkeli]], 1960\u20131968\n* [[Olav Hages\u00e6ther]], 1968\u20131976\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Sigurd Lunde (bishop)|Sigurd Lunde]], 1977\u20131986\n* [[Bj\u00f8rn Bue]], 1986\u20131997\n* [[Ernst Oddvar Baasland]], 1998\u20132009\n* [[Erling Johan Pettersen]], 2009\u20132016\n* [[Ivar Braut]], 2017-2019\n* [[Anne Lise \u00c5dn\u00f8y]] since 2019\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger is divided into nine [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}) spread out over [[Rogaland]] county.

It covers all of [[Rogaland]] county in western [[Norway]]. The cathedral city is [[Stavanger]], where the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] is located.  The bishop is [[Ivar Braut]], who has held the post since 2017.\n\n==History==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger was established in the 12th century (either 1112 or maybe 1125) when it was separated from the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]]. Initially, the large diocese covered the (modern) counties of [[Rogaland]], [[Aust-Agder]], and [[Vest-Agder]] as well as the regions of [[Valdres]] (in [[Oppland]] county), [[Hallingdal]] (in [[Buskerud]] county), and the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]] (in [[Hordaland]] county).  After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Diocese of Stavanger continued in the new [[Church of Norway]].<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOver time, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established Diocese of Stavanger and the cathedral in Stavanger regained its place as the seat of a bishop.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Bishops of Stavanger==\n\n===Catholic (12th century-Reformation)===\n{{Main|Ancient Diocese of Stavanger}}\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Reinald, Bishop of Stavanger|Reinald]] ca. 1112\u20131135\n* [[Jon Birgersson]], 1135\u20131152\n* [[Peter, Bishop of Stavanger|Peter]], 1152\u2013??\n* [[Amund, Bishop of Stavanger|Amund]], ??\u20131171\n* [[Eirik Ivarsson]], 1171\u20131188\n* [[Nj\u00e5l, Bishop of Stavanger|Nj\u00e5l]], 1189/90\u20131207\n* [[Henrik, Bishop of Stavanger|Henrik]], 1207\u20131224\n* [[Askell Jonsson]], 1226\u20131254\n* [[Torgils, Bishop of Stavanger|Torgils]], 1255\u20131276\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Arne, Bishop of Stavanger|Arne]], 1277\u20131303\n* [[Ketil, Bishop of Stavanger|Ketil]], 1304\u20131317\n* [[H\u00e5kon Halldorsson]], 1318\u20131322\n* [[Eirik Ogmundsson]], 1322\u20131342\n* [[Guttorm P\u00e5lsson]], 1343\u20131350\n* [[Sigfrid, Bishop of Stavanger|Sigfrid]], 1351\u20131352\n* [[Gyrd Aslason]], 1354\u20131355\n* [[Bottolf Asbj\u00f8rnsson]], 1355\u20131380\n* [[Hallgeirr Osmundsson]], 1380/81\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Olaf, Bishop of Stavanger|Olaf]], 1381/82\u20131398/1400\n* [[H\u00e5kon Ivarsson]], 1400\u20131426\n* [[Audun Eyvindsson]], 1427\u20131445\n* [[Gunnar Eriksson, Bishop of Stavanger|Gunnar Eriksson]], 1445\u20131451/53\n* [[Sigurd Bj\u00f8rnsson]], 1454\u20131463\n* [[Alv Thorgardsson]], 1464\u20131478\n* [[Eiliv Jonsson]], 1481\u20131512\n* [[Hoskuld Hoskuldsson]], 1513\u20131537\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (Reformation\u20131682)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jon Guttormsen]], 1541\u20131557\n* [[Jens Gregersen Riber]], 1558\u20131571\n* [[J\u00f8rgen Eriksen]], 1571\u20131604\n* [[Laurits Clausen Scabo]], 1605\u20131626\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Tomas Cortsen Wegner]], 1627\u20131654\n* [[Markus Christensen Humble]], 1655\u20131661\n* [[Christen Madsen Tausan]], 1661\u20131680\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Lutheran (1925\u2013present)===\n{{col-float|width=25%}}\n* [[Jacob Christian Petersen]], 1925\u20131940\n* [[Gabriel Skagestad]], 1940\u20131949\n* [[Karl Martinussen]], 1949\u20131960\n* [[Fritjov S\u00f8iland Birkeli]], 1960\u20131968\n* [[Olav Hages\u00e6ther]], 1968\u20131976\n{{col-float-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Sigurd Lunde (bishop)|Sigurd Lunde]], 1977\u20131986\n* [[Bj\u00f8rn Bue]], 1986\u20131997\n* [[Ernst Oddvar Baasland]], 1998\u20132009\n* [[Erling Johan Pettersen]], 2009\u20132016\n* [[Ivar Braut]], 2017-2019\n* [[Anne Lise \u00c5dn\u00f8y]] since 2019\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe Diocese of Stavanger is divided into nine [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}) spread out over the county.
