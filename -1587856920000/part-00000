The film follows Anna, who becomes convinced that her deceased husband, Sean, has been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a 10-year-old boy.\n\nDistributed by [[New Line Cinema]], the film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office failure, grossing $23.9 million against its $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. While scenes of [[Central Park]] are shown on screen, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. After the lecture he goes jogging, collapses, and dies. Ten years later, Anna has accepted a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Joseph ([[Danny Huston]]).\n\nWhen Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap Anna's gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on.\n\nAt a party for Anna's mother, the boy, who has followed Clara, claims to be Anna's deceased husband, Sean, and warns her not to marry Joseph. At first Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day warning her not to marry Joseph she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband.\n\nThat night Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to get more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms.\n\nSean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know whereabouts. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning.\n\nAnna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even giving intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family become worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt.\n\nWhen Anna misses an appointment with her fianc\u00e9 to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but about Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips.\n\nAnna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When he visits he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. We learn that Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and that he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused.\n\nWhen Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that since he loves her he can not be the reincarnated Sean.\n\nAnna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the sea in anguish after the ceremony.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

The legend also recounts how after the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]], defeated [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]] (Sibinjanin Janko in [[Serbian epic poetry]]) along with his wounded (according to some traditions already dead) nephew Banovac Sekula retreated to the safety of the high Komovi mountains. There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon. Hynadi blessed him for this, and predicted that he and his brothers will be great heroes, as well as their descendants, but that his own will always be the largest and that they will always be the leaders of the tribe.    \n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\nRajevi\u0107i is the biggest branch.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon.
