Because of the weak, induced dipole\u2013dipole [[interaction]] between the helium atoms, their microscopic physical properties are mainly determined by their [[zero-point energy]]. Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4. This implies that helium-3 can overcome dipole\u2013dipole interactions with less [[thermal energy]] than helium-4 can.\n\nThe [[quantum mechanical]] effects on helium-3 and helium-4 are significantly different because with two [[proton]]s, two [[neutron]]s, and two [[electron]]s, helium-4 has an overall [[spin (physics)|spin]] of zero, making it a [[boson]], but with one fewer neutron, helium-3 has an overall spin of one half, making it a [[fermion]].\n\nHelium-3 boils at 3.19 [[kelvin|K]] compared with helium-4 at 4.23 K, and its [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is also lower at 3.35 K, compared with helium-4 at 5.2 K. Helium-3 has less than half the density of helium-4 when it is at its boiling point: 59 g/L compared to 125 g/L of helium-4 at a pressure of one atmosphere. Its latent heat of vaporization is also considerably lower at 0.026 [[kilojoule per mole|kJ/mol]] compared with the 0.0829 kJ/mol of helium-4.<ref>[http://www.trgn.com/database/cryogen.html Teragon's Summary of Cryogen Properties] Teragon Research, 2005</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chase|first=C.

Since the atmosphere of the Earth has a mass of about 5.14{{e|15}} tonnes,<ref>[http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI-3299.1 The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses].

(In fact the effective figure is ten times smaller, since the above ppm are ppmv and not ppmw. One must multiply by 3 (the molecular mass of Helium-3) and divide by 29 (the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere), resulting in 3,828 tonnes of helium-3 in the earth's atmosphere.)\n\n<sup>3</sup>He is produced on Earth from three sources: lithium [[spallation]], [[cosmic rays]], and beta decay of tritium (<sup>3</sup>H). The contribution from cosmic rays is negligible within all except the oldest regolith materials, and lithium spallation reactions are a lesser contributor than the production of <sup>4</sup>He by [[alpha particle]] emissions.\n\nThe total amount of helium-3 in the mantle may be in the range of 0.1\u20131 million [[tonne]]s. However, most of the mantle is not directly accessible. Some helium-3 leaks up through deep-sourced [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanoes such as those of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], but only 300&nbsp;grams per year is emitted to the atmosphere. [[Mid-ocean ridge]]s emit another 3 kilogram per year. Around [[subduction|subduction zone]]s, various sources produce helium-3 in [[natural gas]] deposits which possibly contain a thousand tonnes of helium-3 (although there may be 25 thousand tonnes if all ancient subduction zones have such deposits).

The decay of tritium into helium-3 reduces the explosive power of the fusion warhead, so periodically the accumulated helium-3 must be removed from warhead reservoirs and tritium in storage.

A [[dilution refrigerator]] uses a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4 to reach [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] temperatures as low as a few thousandths of a [[kelvin]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194054/http://na47sun05.cern.ch/target/outline/dilref.html Dilution Refrigeration]. cern.ch</ref>\n\nAn important property of helium-3, which distinguishes it from the more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a [[fermion]] since it contains an odd number of spin {{frac|1|2}} particles. Helium-4 nuclei are [[boson]]s, containing an even number of spin {{frac|1|2}} particles. This is a direct result of the [[Angular momentum quantum number#Addition of quantized angular momenta|addition rules]] for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a [[phase transition]]: A fraction of it enters a [[superfluid]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] that can be roughly understood as a type of [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into ''pairs'' analogous to [[Cooper pair]]s in the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]. Each Cooper pair, having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson. During the 1970s, [[David Lee (physicist)|David Lee]], [[Douglas Osheroff]] and [[Robert Coleman Richardson]] discovered two phase transitions along the melting curve, which were soon realized to be the two superfluid phases of helium-3.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Osheroff|first=D.

The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that <sup>3</sup>He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a ''p''-wave superfluid, with spin one, '''S'''=1, and angular momentum one, '''L'''=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, '''J'''='''S'''+'''L'''=0 (vector addition). Excited states are possible with non-zero total angular momentum, '''J'''>0, which are excited pair collective modes. Because of the extreme purity of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He (since all materials except <sup>4</sup>He have solidified and\nsunk to the bottom of the liquid <sup>3</sup>He and any <sup>4</sup>He has phase separated entirely, this is the most pure condensed matter state), these collective modes have been studied with much greater precision than in any other unconventional pairing system.\n\n=== Medical imaging ===\nHelium-3 nuclei have an intrinsic [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|1|2}}, and a relatively high [[magnetogyric ratio]].

The appeal of helium-3 fusion stems from the [[aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]] nature of its reaction products. Helium-3 itself is non-radioactive. The lone high-energy by-product, the [[proton]], can be contained using electric and magnetic fields. The momentum energy of this proton (created in the fusion process) will interact with the containing electromagnetic field, resulting in direct net electricity generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/presentations/jfs_ieee0904.pdf|title= Lunar {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}} and Fusion Power|author=John Santarius|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the higher [[Coulomb barrier]], the temperatures required for {{Hydrogen|||2}} + {{Helium|||3}} fusion are much higher than those of conventional [[D-T fusion]]. Moreover, since both reactants need to be mixed together to fuse, reactions between nuclei of the same reactant will occur, and the D-D reaction ({{Hydrogen|||2}} + {{Hydrogen|||2}}) does produce a [[neutron]]. Reaction rates vary with temperature, but the D-{{Helium|||3}} reaction rate is never greater than 3.56 times the D-D reaction rate (see graph). Therefore, fusion using D-{{Helium|||3}} fuel at the right temperature and a D-lean fuel mixture, can produce a much lower neutron flux than D-T fusion, but is not clean, negating some of its main attraction.\n\nThe second possibility, fusing {{Helium|||3}} with itself ({{Helium|||3}} + {{Helium|||3}}), requires even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), and thus is even more difficult than the D-{{Helium|||3}} reaction. However, it does offer a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the charged protons produced can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. {{Helium|||3}} + {{Helium|||3}} fusion is feasible as demonstrated in the laboratory and has immense advantages, but commercial viability is many years in the future.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/19296/|title=Mining the Moon: Lab experiments suggest that future fusion reactors could use helium-3 gathered from the moon|author=Mark Williams|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>\n\nThe amounts of helium-3 needed as a replacement for [[fossil fuel|conventional fuel]]s are substantial by comparison to amounts currently available. The total amount of energy produced in the {{Deuterium|||2}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Helium|||3}} reaction is 18.4 M[[electronvolt|eV]], which corresponds to some 493 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hour]]s (4.93\u00d710<sup>8</sup> W\u00b7h) per three [[gram]]s (one [[mole (chemistry)|mole]]) of {{Helium|||3}}  If the total amount of energy could be converted to electrical power with 100% efficiency (a physical impossibility), it would correspond to about 30 minutes of output of a gigawatt electrical plant per mole of {{Helium|||3}}.  Thus, a year's production (at 6 grams for each operation hour) would require 52.5 kilograms of helium-3. The amount of fuel needed for large-scale applications can also be put in terms of total consumption: electricity consumption by 107 million U.S. households in 2001<ref>Date from the US Energy Information Administration</ref> totaled 1,140 billion kW\u00b7h (1.14\u00d710<sup>15</sup> W\u00b7h). Again assuming 100% conversion efficiency, 6.7 [[tonne]]s per year of helium-3 would be required for that segment of the energy demand of the United States, 15 to 20 tonnes per year given a more realistic end-to-end conversion efficiency.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n=== Nuclear fuel (continue) ===\n{{Weasel|section|date=March 2013}}\nA second-generation approach to controlled [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] power involves combining helium-3 (<sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He) and [[deuterium]] ([[Deuterium|<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H]]). This reaction produces a [[helium-4]] ion ([[Helium-4|<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He]]) (like an [[alpha particle]], but of different origin) and a high-energy [[proton]] (positively charged hydrogen ion) (<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>p). The most important potential advantage of this fusion reaction for power production as well as other applications lies in its compatibility with the use of [[electrostatic]] fields to control fuel [[ion]]s and the fusion protons. High speed protons, as positively charged particles, can have their kinetic energy converted directly into [[electricity]], through use of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] conversion materials as well as other techniques. Potential conversion efficiencies of 70% may be possible, as there is no need to convert proton energy to heat in order to drive a [[turbine]]-powered [[Electric generator|electrical generator]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThere have been many claims about the capabilities of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on [[deuterium]] and helium-3 would offer lower capital and [[operating cost]]s than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water [[pollution]], and only low-level [[radioactive]] waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in [[investment]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] will be required to develop and construct the first helium-3 fusion [[power plant]]. Financial break even at today's wholesale [[electricity]] prices (5 US cents per [[kilowatt-hour]]) would occur after five 1-[[gigawatt]] plants were on line, replacing old conventional plants or meeting new demand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4|title=Mining The Moon|author=Paul DiMare|date=October 2004|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=2007-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814162104/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4|archive-date=2007-08-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe reality is not so clear-cut. The most advanced fusion programs in the world are [[inertial confinement fusion]] (such as [[National Ignition Facility]]) and [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (such as [[ITER]] and [[Wendelstein 7-X]]). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |title=ITER & Beyond |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520151601/http://www.iter.org/PROJ/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low [[Coulomb barrier]] for this reaction; for D+<sup>3</sup>He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for <sup>3</sup>He\u2013<sup>3</sup>He. The immense cost of reactors like [[ITER]] and [[National Ignition Facility]] are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for [[Aneutronic fusion#Candidate aneutronic reactions|helium-3 fusion reactions]] are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.\n\nTo attempt to work around this problem of massively large power plants that may not even be economical with D-T fusion, let alone the far more challenging D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, a number of other reactors have been proposed&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Fusor]], [[Polywell]], [[Focus fusion]], and many more, though many of these concepts have fundamental problems with achieving a net energy gain, and generally attempt to achieve fusion in thermal disequilibrium, something that could potentially prove impossible,<ref>{{cite news|title=A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems|author= Todd Rider|hdl = 1721.1/29869}}</ref> and consequently, these long-shot programs tend to have trouble garnering funding despite their low budgets.

Because of the weak, induced dipole\u2013dipole [[interaction]] between the helium atoms, their microscopic physical properties are mainly determined by their [[zero-point energy]]. Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4. This implies that helium-3 can overcome dipole\u2013dipole interactions with less [[thermal energy]] than helium-4 can.\n\nThe [[quantum mechanical]] effects on helium-3 and helium-4 are significantly different because with two [[proton]]s, two [[neutron]]s, and two [[electron]]s, helium-4 has an overall [[spin (physics)|spin]] of zero, making it a [[boson]], but with one fewer neutron, helium-3 has an overall spin of one half, making it a [[fermion]].\n\nHelium-3 boils at 3.19 [[kelvin|K]] compared with helium-4 at 4.23 K, and its [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is also lower at 3.35 K, compared with helium-4 at 5.2 K. Helium-3 has less than half the density of helium-4 when it is at its boiling point: 59 g/L compared to 125 g/L of helium-4 at a pressure of one atmosphere. Its latent heat of vaporization is also considerably lower at 0.026 [[kilojoule per mole|kJ/mol]] compared with the 0.0829 kJ/mol of helium-4.<ref>[http://www.trgn.com/database/cryogen.html Teragon's Summary of Cryogen Properties] Teragon Research, 2005</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chase|first=C.

Since the atmosphere of the Earth has a mass of about 5.14{{e|15}} tonnes,<ref>[http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI-3299.1 The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses].

(In fact the effective figure is ten times smaller, since the above ppm are ppmv and not ppmw. One must multiply by 3 (the molecular mass of Helium-3) and divide by 29 (the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere), resulting in 3,828 tonnes of helium-3 in the earth's atmosphere.)\n\n<sup>3</sup>He is produced on Earth from three sources: lithium [[spallation]], [[cosmic rays]], and beta decay of tritium (<sup>3</sup>H). The contribution from cosmic rays is negligible within all except the oldest regolith materials, and lithium spallation reactions are a lesser contributor than the production of <sup>4</sup>He by [[alpha particle]] emissions.\n\nThe total amount of helium-3 in the mantle may be in the range of 0.1\u20131 million [[tonne]]s. However, most of the mantle is not directly accessible. Some helium-3 leaks up through deep-sourced [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanoes such as those of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], but only 300&nbsp;grams per year is emitted to the atmosphere. [[Mid-ocean ridge]]s emit another 3 kilogram per year. Around [[subduction|subduction zone]]s, various sources produce helium-3 in [[natural gas]] deposits which possibly contain a thousand tonnes of helium-3 (although there may be 25 thousand tonnes if all ancient subduction zones have such deposits).

A [[dilution refrigerator]] uses a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4 to reach [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] temperatures as low as a few thousandths of a [[kelvin]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194054/http://na47sun05.cern.ch/target/outline/dilref.html Dilution Refrigeration]. cern.ch</ref>\n\nAn important property of helium-3, which distinguishes it from the more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a [[fermion]] since it contains an odd number of spin {{frac|1|2}} particles. Helium-4 nuclei are [[boson]]s, containing an even number of spin {{frac|1|2}} particles. This is a direct result of the [[Angular momentum quantum number#Addition of quantized angular momenta|addition rules]] for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a [[phase transition]]: A fraction of it enters a [[superfluid]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] that can be roughly understood as a type of [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into ''pairs'' analogous to [[Cooper pair]]s in the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]. Each Cooper pair, having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson. During the 1970s, [[David Lee (physicist)|David Lee]], [[Douglas Osheroff]] and [[Robert Coleman Richardson]] discovered two phase transitions along the melting curve, which were soon realized to be the two superfluid phases of helium-3.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Osheroff|first=D.

The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that <sup>3</sup>He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a ''p''-wave superfluid, with spin one, '''S'''=1, and angular momentum one, '''L'''=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, '''J'''='''S'''+'''L'''=0 (vector addition). Excited states are possible with non-zero total angular momentum, '''J'''>0, which are excited pair collective modes. Because of the extreme purity of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He (since all materials except <sup>4</sup>He have solidified and\nsunk to the bottom of the liquid <sup>3</sup>He and any <sup>4</sup>He has phase separated entirely, this is the most pure condensed matter state), these collective modes have been studied with much greater precision than in any other unconventional pairing system.\n\n=== Medical imaging ===\nHelium-3 nuclei have an intrinsic [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|1|2}}, and a relatively high [[magnetogyric ratio]].

The appeal of helium-3 fusion stems from the [[aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]] nature of its reaction products. Helium-3 itself is non-radioactive. The lone high-energy by-product, the [[proton]], can be contained using electric and magnetic fields. The momentum energy of this proton (created in the fusion process) will interact with the containing electromagnetic field, resulting in direct net electricity generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/presentations/jfs_ieee0904.pdf|title= Lunar {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}} and Fusion Power|author=John Santarius|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the higher [[Coulomb barrier]], the temperatures required for {{Hydrogen|||2}} + {{Helium|||3}} fusion are much higher than those of conventional [[D-T fusion]]. Moreover, since both reactants need to be mixed together to fuse, reactions between nuclei of the same reactant will occur, and the D-D reaction ({{Hydrogen|||2}} + {{Hydrogen|||2}}) does produce a [[neutron]]. Reaction rates vary with temperature, but the D-{{Helium|||3}} reaction rate is never greater than 3.56 times the D-D reaction rate (see graph). Therefore, fusion using D-{{Helium|||3}} fuel at the right temperature and a D-lean fuel mixture, can produce a much lower neutron flux than D-T fusion, but is not clean, negating some of its main attraction.\n\nThe second possibility, fusing {{Helium|||3}} with itself ({{Helium|||3}} + {{Helium|||3}}), requires even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), and thus is even more difficult than the D-{{Helium|||3}} reaction. However, it does offer a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the charged protons produced can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. {{Helium|||3}} + {{Helium|||3}} fusion is feasible as demonstrated in the laboratory and has immense advantages, but commercial viability is many years in the future.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/19296/|title=Mining the Moon: Lab experiments suggest that future fusion reactors could use helium-3 gathered from the moon|author=Mark Williams|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>\n\nThe amounts of helium-3 needed as a replacement for [[fossil fuel|conventional fuel]]s are substantial by comparison to amounts currently available. The total amount of energy produced in the {{Deuterium|||2}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Helium|||3}} reaction is 18.4 M[[electronvolt|eV]], which corresponds to some 493 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hour]]s (4.93\u00d710<sup>8</sup> W\u00b7h) per three [[gram]]s (one [[mole (chemistry)|mole]]) of {{Helium|||3}}  If the total amount of energy could be converted to electrical power with 100% efficiency (a physical impossibility), it would correspond to about 30 minutes of output of a gigawatt electrical plant per mole of {{Helium|||3}}.  Thus, a year's production (at 6 grams for each operation hour) would require 52.5 kilograms of helium-3. The amount of fuel needed for large-scale applications can also be put in terms of total consumption: electricity consumption by 107 million U.S. households in 2001<ref>Date from the US Energy Information Administration</ref> totaled 1,140 billion kW\u00b7h (1.14\u00d710<sup>15</sup> W\u00b7h). Again assuming 100% conversion efficiency, 6.7 [[tonne]]s per year of helium-3 would be required for that segment of the energy demand of the United States, 15 to 20 tonnes per year given a more realistic end-to-end conversion efficiency.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n=== Nuclear fuel (continue) ===\n{{Weasel|section|date=March 2013}}\nA second-generation approach to controlled [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] power involves combining helium-3 (<sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He) and [[deuterium]] ([[Deuterium|<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H]]). This reaction produces a [[helium-4]] ion ([[Helium-4|<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He]]) (like an [[alpha particle]], but of different origin) and a high-energy [[proton]] (positively charged hydrogen ion) (<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>p). The most important potential advantage of this fusion reaction for power production as well as other applications lies in its compatibility with the use of [[electrostatic]] fields to control fuel [[ion]]s and the fusion protons. High speed protons, as positively charged particles, can have their kinetic energy converted directly into [[electricity]], through use of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] conversion materials as well as other techniques. Potential conversion efficiencies of 70% may be possible, as there is no need to convert proton energy to heat in order to drive a [[turbine]]-powered [[Electric generator|electrical generator]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThere have been many claims about the capabilities of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on [[deuterium]] and helium-3 would offer lower capital and [[operating cost]]s than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water [[pollution]], and only low-level [[radioactive]] waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in [[investment]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] will be required to develop and construct the first helium-3 fusion [[power plant]]. Financial break even at today's wholesale [[electricity]] prices (5 US cents per [[kilowatt-hour]]) would occur after five 1-[[gigawatt]] plants were on line, replacing old conventional plants or meeting new demand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4|title=Mining The Moon|author=Paul DiMare|date=October 2004|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=2007-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814162104/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4|archive-date=2007-08-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe reality is not so clear-cut. The most advanced fusion programs in the world are [[inertial confinement fusion]] (such as [[National Ignition Facility]]) and [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (such as [[ITER]] and [[Wendelstein 7-X]]). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |title=ITER & Beyond |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520151601/http://www.iter.org/PROJ/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low [[Coulomb barrier]] for this reaction; for D+<sup>3</sup>He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for <sup>3</sup>He\u2013<sup>3</sup>He. The immense cost of reactors like [[ITER]] and [[National Ignition Facility]] are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for [[Aneutronic fusion#Candidate aneutronic reactions|helium-3 fusion reactions]] are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.\n\nTo attempt to work around this problem of massively large power plants that may not even be economical with D-T fusion, let alone the far more challenging D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, a number of other reactors have been proposed&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Fusor]], [[Polywell]], [[Focus fusion]], and many more, though many of these concepts have fundamental problems with achieving a net energy gain, and generally attempt to achieve fusion in thermal disequilibrium, something that could potentially prove impossible,<ref>{{cite news|title=A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems|author= Todd Rider|hdl = 1721.1/29869}}</ref> and consequently, these long-shot programs tend to have trouble garnering funding despite their low budgets. Unlike the \"big\", \"hot\" fusion systems, however, if such systems were to work, they could scale to the higher barrier \"[[aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]]\" fuels, and therefore their proponents tend to promote [[Aneutronic fusion#Proton\u2013boron fusion|p-B fusion]], which requires no exotic fuels like helium-3.\n\n== Extraterrestrial mining==\n{{further|Lunar resources#Helium-3}}\n\nMaterials on the [[Moon]]'s surface contain helium-3 at concentrations between 1.4 and 15 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] in sunlit areas,<ref>[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/Research/he3_pubs.html FTI Research Projects :: 3He Lunar Mining].

He was also part of the 22-man squad that won the bronze medals at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] finals, but did not make an appearance during the tournament.\n\nIn January 1999, he won his only international cap for Croatia B in a friendly match against [[France national football team|France B]]. He also continued to be Croatia's second-choice goalkeeper during the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying]]. His only appearance in the qualifying came in a 2\u20131 win at home to [[Malta national football team|Malta]] on 21 August 1999. It eventually turned out to be his final international appearance, as he retired from international football two months later, following Croatia's failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2000|finals]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nOn 22 September 2015, the [[Croatia national football team|Croatia national team]] manager [[Ante \u010ca\u010di\u0107]] appointed him to his coaching staff. \u010ca\u010di\u0107 was sacked in October 2017, but Mrmi\u0107 stayed in his role, continuing to work with the national team under the coaching staff of [[Zlatko Dali\u0107]].\n\nIn 2016, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of Turkish side [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]].\n\n==Honours==\n;Be\u015fikta\u015f\n*[[Turkish Cup]]: [[Turkish Cup|1998]]\n*[[Chancellor Cup]]: [[Chancellor Cup|1997]]\n*[[TSYD Cup]]: [[TSYD Cup|1997]]\n\n==Orders==\n*[[File:Ribbon of an Order of the Croatian Wattle.png|50px]] [[Order of the Croatian Interlace]] - 1998<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/98/07/12/h2_hrv.html |title=PREDSJEDNIK TUDJMAN ODLIKOVAO HRVATSKU NOGOMETNU REPREZENTACIJU |language=Croatian |publisher=hrt.hr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108054336/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/98/07/12/h2_hrv.html |archivedate=8 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{FIFA player|170268}}\n*{{NFT player|pid=12733}}\n*{{CFF player|111199/marjan-mrmic}}\n\n{{Croatia Squad 1996 UEFA Euro}}\n{{Croatia Squad 1998 World Cup}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mrmic, Marjan}}\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav footballers]]\n[[Category:Croatian footballers]]\n[[Category:Croatia international footballers]]\n[[Category:Association football goalkeepers]]\n[[Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players]]\n[[Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players]]\n[[Category:Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K. footballers]]\n[[Category:NK Vara\u017edin players]]\n[[Category:HNK Cibalia players]]\n[[Category:R.
