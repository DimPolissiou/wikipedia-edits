Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [https://www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L.

Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], then [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing. Some research supervised by Sherman is published and can be freely accessed in the [https://www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk/journal Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing].\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. His currently serving police executive students include   Stephen Williams, Acting Commissioner of Police, [[Trinidad and Tobago Police Service]]; from the UK, Chief Constables [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]] ([[Thames Valley Police]]), Simon Bailey ([[Norfolk Constabulary]]), John Parkinson ([[West Yorkshire Police]]), and Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale ([[West Midlands Police]]); and Police Chief William Farrar, from the [[Rialto Police Department]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\nSherman has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his work in the field of criminology and policing. Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology.

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [https://www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T.

Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001).

Among the other medals awarded to him are the Vishista Seva Vibhushanaya, the Utthama Seva Padakkama, the Sri Lanka Navy 50th Anniversary Medal, the Sri Lanka Armed Services Long Service Medal, the President\u2019s Inauguration Medal, the 50th Independence Anniversary Commemoration Medal, the East Humanitarian Operation Medal, the North Humanitarian Operation Medal, the North and East Operations Medal, the Purna Bhumi Padakkama, the Vadamarachchi Operation Medal and the Riviresa Campaign Service Medal.\n\nAdmiral Colombage is the most commended Naval Officer. Successive Commanders of the Navy have issued him with \u2018Letters of Commendation\u2019 for exceptional execution of duties and responsibilities and for his achievements in numerous fields such as operational activities, leadership, managerial and administrative skills, academic achievements, highest commitment and dedication towards the cause of the nation. He is the recipient of the prestigious 5-Star Commendation Badge.\n\nHe aptly showed his prowess as an athlete even after joining the Navy winning the Sri Lanka Navy Colours. He held the post of President of the Sri Lanka Navy Athletics Club from 1999 to 2006 and also served as President of the renowned Ceylonese Track and Field Club.

He was awarded College Colours as well as Sri Lanka Schools Colours for athletics.\n\nThough, his forte was track and field, he rose to become a Senior Prefect of the College and Lance Sergeant of the College Cadet Platoon. He was also a popular member of the College Band and took a keen interest in the activities of numerous societies and won the admiration of his peers as well as teachers.\n\n== Military career ==\nAdmiral Colombage joined the Sri Lanka Navy as an Officer Cadet in 1978 and successfully completed his basic training at the renowned [[Naval and Maritime Academy]] in [[Trincomalee]] winning the \u2018Sword of Honour\u2019 for the Best Officer Cadet of the 7th Intake. He was then selected to attend the prestigious International Midshipmen Course in the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], Dartmouth in the United Kingdom.\n\nAdmiral Colombage is the second officer to be considered to the highest seat of the Commander of the Navy straight from an Operational Naval Command. He served as the Commander Eastern Naval Area at the historic Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee until he was chosen to steer the Sri Lanka Navy. He has achieved many firsts in his distinguished, decorative and unblemished naval career spanning 34 years. He has been conferred with two master's degrees - Master of Science in Defence Studies and Master of Arts in International Studies. Presently, Vice Admiral Colombage is reading for his Doctorate in Philosophy.\n\nAdmiral Colombage has been a regular lecturer at the Defence Services Command and Staff College in Colombo since its inception. He is an expert in Maritime Security and has published papers and conducted National-Level Seminars on Maritime Security.

He is also a Fellow of the Nautical Institute of the United Kingdom and currently the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Branch. He holds Diplomas in Security Studies, Conflict Resolution, International Affairs and Information Technology.\n\nHe has commanded four Operational Naval Commands, namely, Eastern, Northern, Western and North Central, for a period of over 5 years. He served twice as the Director General Operations at Naval Headquarters. Prior to that, he served as the Director General Services as well as the Director Naval Training and Personnel. He has also served in the appointments of Deputy Area Commander (North Central), Deputy Area Commander (South) and Deputy Area Commander (East).\n\nAdmiral Colombage has commanded numerous ships of the Sri Lanka Navy including the Fast Missile Vessels, Fast Gun Boats, Fast Attack Craft and amphibious ships and has been awarded the Surface Warfare Badge. He is a weapon specialist who has undergone extensive training with the Indian Navy and in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nHe is a recipient of the Rana Sura Padakkama for gallantry. Among the other medals awarded to him are the Vishista Seva Vibhushanaya, the Utthama Seva Padakkama, the Sri Lanka Navy 50th Anniversary Medal, the Sri Lanka Armed Services Long Service Medal, the President\u2019s Inauguration Medal, the 50th Independence Anniversary Commemoration Medal, the East Humanitarian Operation Medal, the North Humanitarian Operation Medal, the North and East Operations Medal, the Purna Bhumi Padakkama, the Vadamarachchi Operation Medal and the Riviresa Campaign Service Medal.\n\nAdmiral Colombage is the most commended Naval Officer. Successive Commanders of the Navy have issued him with \u2018Letters of Commendation\u2019 for exceptional execution of duties and responsibilities and for his achievements in numerous fields such as operational activities, leadership, managerial and administrative skills, academic achievements, highest commitment and dedication towards the cause of the nation. He is the recipient of the prestigious 5-Star Commendation Badge.\n\nHe aptly showed his prowess as an athlete even after joining the Navy winning the Sri Lanka Navy Colours. He held the post of President of the Sri Lanka Navy Athletics Club from 1999 to 2006 and also served as President of the renowned Ceylonese Track and Field Club. Presently, he is the President of the Sri Lanka Navy Sports Board and a Vice President of the Defence Services Sports Board.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[D.
