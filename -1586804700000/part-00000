Among those is the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]], co-founded by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[European Commission]]. Since 2017 it has tried to produce a platform approach for dealing with emerging epidemic disease such as COVID-19, which would enable rapid vaccine development and immunity research in response to outbreaks.<ref name=wsj-prep>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/preparing-for-the-next-pandemic-11585936915 \"Preparing for the Next Pandemic\"], ''Wall Street Journal'', April 3, 2020</ref><ref>Gates, Bill.

It made a number of serious errors at the outset of the outbreak, notably in Wuhan, where it failed to communicate. Local authorities withheld information about the virus from the public and the central government and silenced doctors who spoke out.<ref name=cfr/> A study by England's [[University of Southampton]] suggests the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% had China moved to contain the virus three weeks sooner.<ref name=wsj-info>Editorial Board, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-health-coronavirus-disinformation-11586122093 \"World Health Coronavirus Disinformation\"], ''Wall Street Journal'', April 5, 2020</ref>\n\nThe WHO has been criticized for not acting promptly and by failing to provide available information. The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info/> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt that the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The CEO of [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] in Boston, saw the problem:\n{{quote|Anybody with eyes in their head, anybody who is watching what is happening in New York and Washington and elsewhere would be foolish not to get ready now.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\". Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the HHS.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Centralized biodefense strategy===\n\nCiting lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], President Trump released a [[National Biodefense Strategy]] on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Statement from the President on the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security Presidential Memorandum |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-national-biodefense-strategy-national-security-presidential-memorandum/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |last1=Brokaw |first1=Sommer |title=Trump signs presidential memo on national biodefense |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/18/Trump-signs-presidential-memo-on-national-biodefense/2071537290820/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/4c21af485a7d4ccebb22f7316b55d014/White-House-sets-'new-direction'-in-biodefense-strategy|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|date=September 18, 2018|agency=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BartholomewOmberg>Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, [https://thebulletin.org/2019/01/making-sense-of-the-2018-national-biodefense-strategy/ Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (January 18, 2019).</ref> According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation's defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.<ref name=\"statement\" /><ref name=\"UPI\" /> Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed the Secretary of HHS [[Alex Azar]] to oversee implementation of the government's new biodefense strategy and directed [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]] to assist in reviewing and improving the nation's biodefenses.<ref name=\"Owermohle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|website=Politico|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Memo\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"statement\" /> At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,<ref name=BartholomewOmberg /> Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Trump administration outlines new biodefense approach |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-rolling-out-new-biodefense-strategy/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=CBS |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and departures===\n\nIn May 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), largely merging the group responsible for global [[health security]] and [[biodefense]] into a bigger group responsible for [[counter-proliferation]] and biodefense.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert, which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

Most of the score was written while the animation was still in the early stages, with Williams seeking to employ \"the old [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] technique of doing music first and have the animators trying to follow what the music is doing\". Eventually, several cues had to be revised during the editing of the film. The composer decided to employ various musical styles, with \"1920s, 1930s European jazz\" for the opening credits and \"pirate music\" for the battle at sea.<ref>\"Tintin: The Score\", ''The Adventures of Tintin'' DVD</ref> The score was released on 21 October 2011 by [[Sony Classical Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures Of Tintin: John Williams|url=https://www.amazon.fr/The-Adventures-Of-Tintin/dp/B005VTVLOO|publisher=Amazon.fr|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| all_music    = [[John Williams]]\n| total_length = {{duration|m=65|s=22}}\n| title1       = The Adventures of Tintin\n| length1      = 3:07\n| title2       = Snowy's Theme\n| length2      = 2:09\n| title3       = The Secret of the Scrolls\n| length3      = 3:12\n| title4       = Introducing the Thompsons and Snowy's Chase\n| length4      = 4:08\n| title5       = Marlinspike Hall\n| length5      = 3:58\n| title6       = Escape from the Karaboudjan\n| length6      = 3:20\n| title7       = Sir Francis and the Unicorn\n| length7      = 5:05\n| title8       = Captain Haddock Takes the Oars\n| length8      = 2:17\n| title9       = Red Rackham's Curse and the Treasure\n| length9      = 6:10\n| title10      = Capturing Mr. Silk\n| length10     = 2:57\n| title11      = The Flight to Bagghar\n| length11     = 3:33\n| title12      = The Milanese Nightingale\n| length12     = 1:29\n| title13      = Presenting Bianca Castafiore\n| length13     = 3:27\n| title14      = The Pursuit of the Falcon\n| length14     = 5:43\n| title15      = The Captain's Counsel\n| length15     = 2:10\n| title16      = The Clash of the Cranes\n| length16     = 3:48\n| title17      = The Return to Marlinspike Hall and Finale\n| length17     = 5:51\n| title18      = The Adventure Continues\n| length18     = 2:58\n}}\n\n==Differences from the source material==\nThe film mainly draws its story from ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' (1943) and ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' (1941) and to a much lesser degree, from ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' (1944). There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

Most of the score was written while the animation was still in the early stages, with Williams seeking to employ \"the old [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] technique of doing music first and have the animators trying to follow what the music is doing\". Eventually, several cues had to be revised during the editing of the film. The composer decided to employ various musical styles, with \"1920s, 1930s European jazz\" for the opening credits and \"pirate music\" for the battle at sea.<ref>\"Tintin: The Score\", ''The Adventures of Tintin'' DVD</ref> The score was released on 21 October 2011 by [[Sony Classical Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures Of Tintin: John Williams|url=https://www.amazon.fr/The-Adventures-Of-Tintin/dp/B005VTVLOO|publisher=Amazon.fr|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| all_music    = [[John Williams]]\n| total_length = {{duration|m=65|s=22}}\n| title1       = The Adventures of Tintin\n| length1      = 3:07\n| title2       = Snowy's Theme\n| length2      = 2:09\n| title3       = The Secret of the Scrolls\n| length3      = 3:12\n| title4       = Introducing the Thompsons and Snowy's Chase\n| length4      = 4:08\n| title5       = Marlinspike Hall\n| length5      = 3:58\n| title6       = Escape from the Karaboudjan\n| length6      = 3:20\n| title7       = Sir Francis and the Unicorn\n| length7      = 5:05\n| title8       = Captain Haddock Takes the Oars\n| length8      = 2:17\n| title9       = Red Rackham's Curse and the Treasure\n| length9      = 6:10\n| title10      = Capturing Mr. Silk\n| length10     = 2:57\n| title11      = The Flight to Bagghar\n| length11     = 3:33\n| title12      = The Milanese Nightingale\n| length12     = 1:29\n| title13      = Presenting Bianca Castafiore\n| length13     = 3:27\n| title14      = The Pursuit of the Falcon\n| length14     = 5:43\n| title15      = The Captain's Counsel\n| length15     = 2:10\n| title16      = The Clash of the Cranes\n| length16     = 3:48\n| title17      = The Return to Marlinspike Hall and Finale\n| length17     = 5:51\n| title18      = The Adventure Continues\n| length18     = 2:58\n}}\n\n==Differences from the source material==\nThe film mainly draws its story from ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' (1943) and ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' (1941) and to a much lesser degree, from ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' (1944). There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

He also earned 27 [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team]] and went to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry <ref>{{cite web|last=Laird |first=Sam |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/19/soccer-youtube-jimmy-conrad-kick-tv/#0nOvi.RJSkqM |title=A Soccer Star's Transition From the Pitch to YouTube |publisher=Mashable |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> and currently stars on his [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJimmyConrad Jimmy Conrad]. He currently serves as the head coach of [[USL League Two]] side [[San Francisco Glens]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===High school and college===\nBorn in [[Arcadia, California]], Conrad attended [[Temple City High School]] in [[Temple City, California]] and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at [[San Diego State University]] in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Championship]] team.\n\n===Professional===\nUndrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams.  Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct [[San Diego Flash]] of the [[USL First Division|A-League]] which gave him a contract.  In 1999, [[Brian Quinn (soccer)|Brian Quinn]] became the head coach of the [[San Jose Clash]].  When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, [[Ralf Wilhelms]], head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the [[San Diego Sockers (1974\u201396)|San Diego Sockers]], recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper [[Joe Cannon (soccer)|Joe Cannon]].<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/20060118-9999-lz1s18soccr-1.html Often-overlooked Jimmy Conrad, now with national team, has proved doubters wrong]</ref>  The Clash signed Conrad that year.  He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the [[MLS Cup]] in 2001. In 2000, he also played for [[Lech Pozna\u0144]] in Poland.\n\nIn 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select [[Arturo \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1985)|Arturo Alvarez]]. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the [[US Open Cup]] and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's [[MLS Best XI|Best XI]] and was a finalist for [[MLS Defender of the Year Award]]. He won the award a year later.\n\nDespite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach [[Curt Onalfo]] rewarded him the club captaincy.\n\nConrad was out of contract after the [[2010 MLS season]] and elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]]. On December 15, 2010 Conrad was selected by [[Chivas USA]] in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |title=Wolff goes 1st in Stage 2 Re-Entry Draft, \u00c1ngel to LA  |work=www.mlssoccer.com |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219135941/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |archivedate=19 December 2010 |quote=Wolff's former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad also went in the early going on Wednesday, taken second overall by Chivas USA.

In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the team's 1\u20131 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].

He also earned 27 [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team]] and went to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry <ref>{{cite web|last=Laird |first=Sam |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/19/soccer-youtube-jimmy-conrad-kick-tv/#0nOvi.RJSkqM |title=A Soccer Star's Transition From the Pitch to YouTube |publisher=Mashable |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> and currently stars on his [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJimmyConrad Jimmy Conrad]. He currently serves as the head coach of [[USL League Two]] side [[San Francisco Glens]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===High school and college===\nBorn in [[Arcadia, California]], Conrad attended [[Temple City High School]] in [[Temple City, California]] and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at [[San Diego State University]] in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Championship]] team.\n\n===Professional===\nUndrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams.  Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct [[San Diego Flash]] of the [[USL First Division|A-League]] which gave him a contract.  In 1999, [[Brian Quinn (soccer)|Brian Quinn]] became the head coach of the [[San Jose Clash]].  When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, [[Ralf Wilhelms]], head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the [[San Diego Sockers (1974\u201396)|San Diego Sockers]], recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper [[Joe Cannon (soccer)|Joe Cannon]].<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/20060118-9999-lz1s18soccr-1.html Often-overlooked Jimmy Conrad, now with national team, has proved doubters wrong]</ref>  The Clash signed Conrad that year.  He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the [[MLS Cup]] in 2001. In 2000, he also played for [[Lech Pozna\u0144]] in Poland.\n\nIn 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select [[Arturo \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1985)|Arturo Alvarez]]. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the [[US Open Cup]] and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's [[MLS Best XI|Best XI]] and was a finalist for [[MLS Defender of the Year Award]]. He won the award a year later.\n\nDespite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach [[Curt Onalfo]] rewarded him the club captaincy.\n\nConrad was out of contract after the [[2010 MLS season]] and elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]]. On December 15, 2010 Conrad was selected by [[Chivas USA]] in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |title=Wolff goes 1st in Stage 2 Re-Entry Draft, \u00c1ngel to LA  |work=www.mlssoccer.com |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219135941/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |archivedate=19 December 2010 |quote=Wolff's former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad also went in the early going on Wednesday, taken second overall by Chivas USA.

Harding]] from 1921 to 1923. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a seminal investigation by Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first [[Cabinet of the United States|presidential cabinet]] member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.\n\nBefore the [[Watergate scandal]], Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|scandal in the history of American politics]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |title=Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time |last=Cherny |first=Robert W |work=History Now |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709015531/http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}</ref> It damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its controversial handling of the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922]] and Harding's veto of the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act|Bonus Bill]] in 1922.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Domestic-and-foreign-affairs.html | title = Grant-Eisenhower | contribution = Warren G Harding: Domestic & foreign affairs | publisher = President profiles}}.</ref> Congress subsequently passed legislation, enduring to this day, giving subpoena power to the House and Senate for review of tax records of any US citizen without regard to elected or appointed position, nor subject to White House interference.<ref name=Paletta9April>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-treasury-lawyers-discussed-trumps-tax-returns-before-democrats-request-mnuchin-says/2019/04/09/9693618e-5ad2-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html |title=Mnuchin reveals White House lawyers consulted Treasury on Trump tax returns, despite law meant to limit political involvement |work=The Washington Post|date=9 April 2019|accessdate=9 April 2019|first=Damian|last=Paletta}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Teapot Rock postcard crop.jpg|thumb|Teapot Dome around the time of the scandal, featuring Teapot Rock (from postcard c. 1922)]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from [[coal]] to [[fuel oil]]. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.\n\nLater in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|100000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn |US}}) in November 1921. He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.\n\n==Investigation and outcome==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nIn April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

La Follette Sr.]] of [[Wisconsin]] led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent. However, his suspicions were aroused after his own office in the [[Senate Office Building]] was ransacked.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Investigates_the_Teapot_Dome_Scandal.htm|title=Senate Investigates the \"Teapot Dome\" Scandal |work= Historical Minutes: 1921\u20131940|publisher=Art & History, United States Senate}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Albert B. Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]\n\nDemocrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.\n\nMoney from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained.

Harding]] from 1921 to 1923. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a seminal investigation by Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first [[Cabinet of the United States|presidential cabinet]] member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.\n\nBefore the [[Watergate scandal]], Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|scandal in the history of American politics]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |title=Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time |last=Cherny |first=Robert W |work=History Now |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709015531/http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}</ref> It damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its controversial handling of the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922]] and Harding's veto of the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act|Bonus Bill]] in 1922.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Domestic-and-foreign-affairs.html | title = Grant-Eisenhower | contribution = Warren G Harding: Domestic & foreign affairs | publisher = President profiles}}.</ref> Congress subsequently passed legislation, enduring to this day, giving subpoena power to the House and Senate for review of tax records of any US citizen without regard to elected or appointed position, nor subject to White House interference.<ref name=Paletta9April>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-treasury-lawyers-discussed-trumps-tax-returns-before-democrats-request-mnuchin-says/2019/04/09/9693618e-5ad2-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html |title=Mnuchin reveals White House lawyers consulted Treasury on Trump tax returns, despite law meant to limit political involvement |work=The Washington Post|date=9 April 2019|accessdate=9 April 2019|first=Damian|last=Paletta}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Teapot Rock postcard crop.jpg|thumb|Teapot Dome around the time of the scandal, featuring Teapot Rock (from postcard c. 1922)]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from [[coal]] to [[fuel oil]]. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.\n\nLater in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|100000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn |US}}) in November 1921. He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.\n\n==Investigation and outcome==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nIn April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]\n\nDemocrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.\n\nMoney from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.<ref name=revenues/>\n\nIn 1929, Fall was found guilty of accepting bribes from Doheny. Conversely, in 1930, Doheny was acquitted of paying bribes to Fall.

He was designated as the UNP candidate in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], but was then assassinated by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE).\n\n==Early Life==\nHe was born in [[Kandy]] as the eldest son of a family of seven children to [[Andrew Dissanayake]] who served as an MP and a deputy minister in the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] government of [[Solomon Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]]. His mother, Welegedara Samaratunga Kumarihamy of Kotmale. Born and bred in Kotmale, his basic values were cultivated in this rural milieu social surrounding and environment. The wealthy Dissanayake family resided in both [[Kandy]] as well as [[Nuwara Eliya]]. Dissanayake had his schooling at the prestigious [[Trinity College (Kandy)|Trinity College]] in Kandy, and received his tertiary education at the [[Sri Lanka Law College]]. Later in life, he completed an MPhil Degree in International Relations at [[Cambridge University]] UK.\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Gamini Dissanayake statue.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Gamini Dissanayake statue at<br /> Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo]] -->\n\n==Political career==\nGamini Dissanayake won the 1970 elections and became a member of parliament under UNP candidature and was one of the 18 UNP members in the parliament at a time when his party has faced an humiliating defeat. He comfortably secured his Nuwaraeliya-Maskeliya multielectorate seat in the 1977 elections and was appointed as the minister of Mahaweli Development. Dissanyake spearheaded the [[Mahaweli Development programme|Mahaweli Development Project]]. This was a huge project which was expected to take 30 years to finish. But due to Dissanayake's skills he managed to finish the project within 6 years. The Mahaweli Development Project is the largest development project conducted in Sri Lanka after independence. The whole country was affected by the project which focused on irrigation, hydro power generation, agriculture, town & country development. Further it was criticised by the time as to introduce sinhala population into Tamil's motherland. Majority of the power generated for the local consumption is generated from these hydropower plants while an overwhelming majority of the rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is conducted in these [[Mahaweli]] areas.\n\nHe was the chairperson of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped his country to gain the Test Status in cricket. He played a pivotal role in signing the Indoo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987. In 1989 he was re elected as a MP from Nuwaraeliya District securing the highest percentage of preferential votes obtained by any UNP MP. He was the Minister of Estate Development during Premadasa regime. He was not awarded a portfolio in 1990 cabinet reshuffle and remained as a back-seat MP in the parliament. Dissanayake was accused of abduction of Prof. Ralph Bultjens. Prof Rohan Goonarathne in an interview with Hasitha Kuruppu told that Dissanayake did that as Bultjens in his lectures accused Dissanayake for swindling of money.<ref>GunaratnaRohan. Interview with Hasitha Kuruppu. Ceylontoday. November 2013</ref> Later he was acquitted from the courts.\n\nHe played a major role in the aborted impeachment motion against President Premadasa and as a result was expelled from UNP in 1992. In the same year Dissanayaka joined Lalith Athulathmudali to form United National Democratic Front (DUNF) which was a rising political force of that era. Dissanayaka contested to Kandy District at 1993 provincial council elections and became a member of the Central Provincial Council. After the assassination of Athulathmudali, Dissanayake became the leader of DUNF. Later he rejoined UNP and was appointed to the parliament as a national list MP and was offered a vital portfolio in the Wijethunga Government. In 1994 PA came to power defeating UNP when Dissanayaka was re elected as a member of parliament from Kandy District.

He was designated as the UNP candidate in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], but was then assassinated by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE).\n\n==Early Life==\nHe was born in [[Kandy]] as the eldest son of a family of seven children to [[Andrew Dissanayake]] who served as an MP and a deputy minister in the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] government of [[Solomon Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]]. His mother, Welegedara Samaratunga Kumarihamy of Kotmale. Born and bred in Kotmale, his basic values were cultivated in this rural milieu social surrounding and environment. The wealthy Dissanayake family resided in both [[Kandy]] as well as [[Nuwara Eliya]]. Dissanayake had his schooling at the prestigious [[Trinity College (Kandy)|Trinity College]] in Kandy, and received his tertiary education at the [[Sri Lanka Law College]]. Later in life, he completed an MPhil Degree in International Relations at [[Cambridge University]] UK.\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Gamini Dissanayake statue.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Gamini Dissanayake statue at<br /> Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo]] -->\n\n==Political career==\nGamini Dissanayake won the 1970 elections and became a member of parliament under UNP candidature and was among one of the 18 UNP members in the parliament at a time when his party has faced an humiliating defeat. He comfortably secured his Nuwaraeliya-Maskeliya multielectorate seat in the 1977 elections and was appointed as the minister of Mahaweli Development. Dissanyake spearheaded the [[Mahaweli Development programme|Mahaweli Development Project]]. This was a huge project which was expected to take 30 years to finish. But due to Dissanayake's skills he managed to finish the project within 6 years. The Mahaweli Development Project is the largest development project conducted in Sri Lanka after independence. The whole country was affected by the project which focused on irrigation, hydro power generation, agriculture, town & country development. Further it was criticised by the time as to introduce sinhala population into Tamil's motherland. Majority of the power generated for the local consumption is generated from these hydropower plants while an overwhelming majority of the rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is conducted in these [[Mahaweli]] areas.\n\nHe was the chairperson of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped his country to gain the Test Status in cricket. He played a pivotal role in signing the Indoo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987. In 1989 he was re elected as a MP from Nuwaraeliya District securing the highest percentage of preferential votes obtained by any UNP MP. He was the Minister of Estate Development during Premadasa regime. He was not awarded a portfolio in 1990 cabinet reshuffle and remained as a back-seat MP in the parliament. Dissanayake was accused of abduction of Prof. Ralph Bultjens. Prof Rohan Goonarathne in an interview with Hasitha Kuruppu told that Dissanayake did that as Bultjens in his lectures accused Dissanayake for swindling of money.<ref>GunaratnaRohan. Interview with Hasitha Kuruppu. Ceylontoday. November 2013</ref> Later he was acquitted from the courts.\n\nHe played a major role in the aborted impeachment motion against President Premadasa and as a result was expelled from UNP in 1992. In the same year Dissanayaka joined Lalith Athulathmudali to form United National Democratic Front (DUNF) which was a rising political force of that era. Dissanayaka contested to Kandy District at 1993 provincial council elections and became a member of the Central Provincial Council. After the assassination of Athulathmudali, Dissanayake became the leader of DUNF. Later he rejoined UNP and was appointed to the parliament as a national list MP and was offered a vital portfolio in the Wijethunga Government. In 1994 PA came to power defeating UNP when Dissanayaka was re elected as a member of parliament from Kandy District. In a contest held among UNP MPs to choose the opposition leader Dissanayaka recorded a comfortable victory over Ranil Wickramasinghe.\n\n==Assassination==\nWhen President [[Dingiri Banda Wijetunga|D.B. Wijetunga]] indicated he would not run in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], Dissanayake was selected as the UNP candidate at the same time he was the Leader of the Opposition in parliament.

This cartoon was released a year after ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, \"Oh boy! What a day!\" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer (with the natural setting in the shape of a giant hand fan revealed to be a city dump) and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes dinner-like breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up, even when his alarm clock rings and pulls off his blanket. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath, but he sees birds and tries to swat them with the towel. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area.\n\nWhen Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion and without stopping - for breakfast, in which it drives through a closed road. After several mishaps during the meal, eventually having popcorn for breakfast, Goofy notices that no one is in the driver's seat and accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashing into a truck and two trains and is a wreck on the inside (but okay on the outside) by the time it's miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy, who was singing \"''She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes''\" while driving down the hill, says in the end, \"Well, I brought you down, safe and sound.\"\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Mickey Mouse: [[Walt Disney]]\n* Donald Duck: [[Clarence Nash]]\n* Goofy: [[Pinto Colvig]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hischak |first1=Thomas S. |title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-0786462711 |page=257 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Disney_Voice_Actors/e1RTP8thtR0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=traffic+troubles+mickey+mouse&pg=PA257&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\nA Fisher-Price version of the movie (and silent), was released for the Movie Viewer in 1974, and lasted until 1979.

In addition, the short film is a parody of the book, ''Through the Looking Glass'', by Lewis Carroll.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMickey falls asleep after reading ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]]. An astral projection of himself (presumably Mickey in his dream state) leaves his body and passes through his mirror into an alternate version of his house. His furniture and possessions have come to life and are complete with faces and personalities, but most of them remain motionless. He jumps on a rocking chair that throws him off in annoyance while a nearby coat rack watches in surprise, and lands on the footrest that behaves like a puppy while Mickey rides on it like a horse until it jumps into the rocking chair. While the chair tries to calm down the footrest, Mickey tries to comfort them, only to end up angering them instead. He bumps into an umbrella, who scolds him until it suddenly drops open and re-closes itself in embarrassment before returning to where it originally was.\nMickey then comes across a nut cracker breaking open a walnut and offers it to him while it eats the shells. After eating the walnut, Mickey's lower body commences to wildly spin around, and it hits his face. While his lower body crazily spins, he suddenly becomes gigantic and then shrinks. The telephone suddenly rings and it throws its receiver down to Mickey, who uses it to climb up to the table. He attempts to answer the call, only to get responses from the phone itself and then proceeds to jump rope with the telephone, who uses its receiver and wire as a jump rope while the radio begins playing music.\nMickey begins to dance his way through his house, tap dancing on a [[top hat]] (wearing a tiny one with a match for a cane) with some gloves (eventually he gets his butt kicked twice by the gloves), [[playing cards]] (some of them hit Mickey's butt during the dance), and eventually the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] card (who resembles [[Greta Garbo]]). The [[joker (playing card)|joker]] on his bicycle notices and alerts the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] who uses the joker's bike to get down there and pulls the queen aside before proceeding to fight for his lady in a sword duel with Mickey, who uses both a [[sewing needle]] and a [[Button (clothing)|button]] as a makeshift sword after the King of Hearts pushes him and gets his butt stabbed by the needle. \nMickey defeats the king by pushing him into an inkwell, where a stamp takes him out and cleans him. Considering this as the last straw, the king then orders for the cards to be called out to get rid of Mickey for good and the radio acts as an alarm to summon the cards like police cars - \"Calling all cards! Calling all cards!\" in which some come out from the king's throne and some come out from a drawer. Chaos ensues as Mickey runs from the cards. He picks up a fountain pen, hides in a basket of yarn, and uses the pen like a machine gun to fire ink at the cards while wearing a thimble-like a helmet. The pen eventually runs out of ink, allowing the cards to pig-pile on Mickey, who then escapes in a torn sock. After being spotted, the cards give chase again and throw their pictures at him. Mickey then turns on an electric fan to blow the cards back while the telephone calls the police in panic as Mickey swings from a lamp rope and runs on a globe until he trips and falls into the globe's [[Bay of Bengal]] and is thrown out by a figure, who appears to be a small version of Neptune, by impaling Mickey's butt. He then grows back to his normal size and escapes back to the real world through the mirror where he reenters his body. Eventually, he is awakened by his alarm clock and it has all been a dream and goes back to sleep after throwing his alarm clock into a drawer.\n\n==Releases==\n* 1936 &ndash; theatrical release\n* 1956 &ndash; ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'', episode #3.8: \"[[The Plausible Impossible]]\" (TV)\n* c. 1972 &ndash; ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'', episode #27: \"Mickey Mouse\" (TV)\n* 1981 &ndash; \"[[Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections]] Volume One\" (VHS)\n* c. 1983 &ndash; ''[[Good Morning, Mickey!]]'', episode #4 (TV)\n* c. 1988 &ndash; ''[[Mickey's Magical World]]'', (VHS)\n* c. 1992 &ndash; ''[[Mickey's Mouse Tracks]]'', episode #52 (TV)\n* 1997 &ndash; ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (TV series)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', episode #1.50: \"Storyteller Mickey\" (TV)\n* 1998 &ndash; \"[[The Spirit of Mickey]]\" (VHS)\n* 2001 &ndash; \"[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave One#Mickey Mouse in Living Color|Mickey Mouse in Living Color]]\" (DVD)\n* 2004/2011 &ndash; Bonus on DVD release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (DVD)\n* 2009 &ndash; Walt Disney Animation Collection: ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' (DVD)\n* 2011 &ndash; ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'', episode #23 (TV)\n* 2012 &ndash; ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'': Volume 5 (DVD)\n* 2018 &ndash; ''Celebrating Mickey'' (Blu-ray/DVD/Digital)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This cartoon was featured, and referenced, in the 2002 video game ''[[Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse]]''.\n* Some elements from the cartoon like the cards and the opening were used in ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.\n* The song during the magic gloves dance scene was used for the ''[[Walt Disney Mini Classics]]'' promos during their movie's end.\n* The melody during Mickey\u2019s marching with the cards in the middle of the film is a jazzed-up version of the music used in another 1932 cartoon classic, ''Santa\u2019s Workshop''.

He is best known as the writer of ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1959), the basis for the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film of the same name]] by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. His fondness for a [[pun]] is evident in the titles of his story collections such as ''Tales in a Jugular Vein'', ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of'' and ''Out of the Mouths of Graves''.\n\nBloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle and began his professional writing career immediately after graduation, aged 17. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while Bloch started his career by emulating Lovecraft and his brand of \"[[cosmic horror]]\", he later specialized in crime and horror stories dealing with a more psychological approach.\n\nBloch was a contributor to [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to [[science fiction fanzine]]s and [[fandom]] in general.\n\nHe won the [[Hugo Award]] (for his story \"[[That Hell-Bound Train]]\"), the [[Bram Stoker Award]], and the [[World Fantasy Award]]. He served a term as president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]] (1970) and was a member of that organization and of [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], the [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of [[Ed Gein]]\" (1962)<ref>The essay was previously collected in ''The Lost Bloch, Volume Three: Crimes and Punishments'' (2002) {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?995871 |title= Bibliography: The Shambles of Ed Gein |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American [[true crime]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=289&section=toc |author= [[Library of America]] |title= True Crime: An American Anthology |publisher= Library of America |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis favorites among his own novels were ''The Kidnapper'', ''The Star Stalker'', ''Psycho'', ''Night-World,'' and ''Strange Eons''.<ref name=Larson>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Randall |title= The Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969\u20131986|year=1989 |publisher=Starmont House |isbn=1-55742-147-1}}</ref> His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of [[Germans|German]] [[Jewish]] descent. Bloch's family moved to [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the [[Methodist Church]] there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and attended Emerson Grammar School.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography''. NY: Tor, 1993, p. 30</ref> In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror.<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\">''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', April 6, 1935.</ref><ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\">Reprint of 1949 autobiographical article in Graeme Flanagan, ''Robert Bloch: A Bio-Bibliography''. Canberra: Flanagan, 1979, pp. 6-12</ref> Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the Public Library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead [[toy soldiers]] and for [[silent cinema]].<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to [[Milwaukee]], where Stella worked at the [[Lizzie Black Kander|Milwaukee Jewish Settlement]] [[settlement house]]. Robert attended Washington, then [[Lincoln High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Lincoln High School]], where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of ''The Quill'', Lincoln's [[literary magazine]], and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was [[Death (personification)|Death]]). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\"/> during the height of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\n\n==Career==\n===''Weird Tales'' magazine and the influence of H. P.

In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked ''Weird Tales'' (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/><ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed).

''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), p. 15</ref> The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. ''Weird Tales'' cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new ''Weird Tales'' issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9.<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> His parents were not impressed with [[Hugh Doak Rankin]]'s sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukeee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading ''Weird Tales'' during convalescence from flu.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]], a frequent contributor to ''Weird Tales'', became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"[[Pickman's Model]],\" in ''Weird Tales'' for October 1927.<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\">Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 49.</ref> Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell|James Lowell]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. In 'Pickman's Model', the ghouls ate all three. Now that, I decided, was poetic justice.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\"/> As a teenager, Bloch wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft (1933), asking where he could find copies of earlier stories of Lovecraft's that Bloch had missed.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 64-65.</ref> Lovecraft lent them to him.

Bloch took up Lovecraft's offer in late April 1933, sending him two short items, \"The Gallows\" and another work whose title is unknown.<ref>S. T. Joshi, \"A Literary Tutelage: Robert Bloch and H.

Barlow]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Donald Wandrei]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry S. Whitehead]], [[E. Hoffman Price]], [[Bernard Austin Dwyer]] and [[J. Vernon Shea]]. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies,\" \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to ''Weird Tales''; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine ''Marvel Tales'' (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in ''[[Unusual Stories]]'' (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 50</ref>\n\nBloch graduated from high school in June, 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to ''Weird Tales.'' Bloch's first publication in ''Weird Tales'' was a letter criticising the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories of [[Robert E. Howard]]. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to ''Weird Tales,'' were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?59533 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Feast in the Abbey |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?63765 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Secret in the Tomb |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of [[Arkham House]]).<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 80.</ref> Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket.

NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met [[Farnsworth Wright]], the then editor of ''Weird Tales''. He also met the first ''Weird Tales'' writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - [[Otto Binder]].<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 49</ref>\n\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features [[Nyarlathotep]]; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'' and ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Cultes des Goules|Cultes des Goules]]''. Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume ''Mysteries of the Worm'' (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in ''[[Something About Cats and Other Pieces]]''.\n\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character [[Robert Harrison Blake|Robert Blake]] in Lovecraft's story \"[[The Haunter of the Dark]]\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"[[The Shambler from the Stars (Short Story)|The Shambler from the Stars]]\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.loa.org/2010/09/what-robert-bloch-owes-to-h-p-lovecraft.html |author= [[Library of America]] |date= September 23, 2010 |title= What Robert Bloch owes to H.

Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\">\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 51</ref> Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (''Weird Tales'' Sept 1950).\n\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization,  even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" <ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\"/> Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for ''Weird Tales'', where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the [[conte cruel]] (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), [[demonic possession]] (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and [[black magic]] (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited [[Henry Kuttner]] in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\", was published in ''Amazing Stories'' (August 1938).\n\n===Milwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression===\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Ralph Milne Farley]] and [[Raymond A. Palmer]]. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with [[C.L. Moore]] and her husband [[Henry Kuttner]], who visited him in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians [[Stoopnagle and Budd]], and to [[Roy Atwell]]. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in ''Weird Tales'' (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\n\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' for April. ''Weird Tales'' published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in ''Amazing Stories'' (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".<ref>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', August 1938, p.146</ref>\n\n=== Campaign manager for Carl Zeidler ===\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for [[List of mayors of Milwaukee|Mayor of Milwaukee]] of a little-known assistant city attorney named [[Carl Zeidler]]. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, ''Once Around the Bloch'', he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:\n\n{{quote|If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn (\"The Cloak\") in ''Unknown''. Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little [[vampire]] story called \"The Cloak\", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.}}\n\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (''Amazing Stories,'' August) and \"The Cloak\" (''Unknown,'' March).\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Fantastic adventures 195008.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Devil With You\" was the cover story in the July 1950 issue of ''Fantastic Adventures''.]]\n[[File:Imagination 195106.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novella \"Hell's Angel\" was the cover story in the June 1951 issue of ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]].]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's completion of the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\" was touted by ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' as \"A New Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece\".]]\n[[File:Other worlds 195306.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Thinking Cap\" was the cover story in the June 1953 issue of ''[[Other Worlds Science Stories|Other Worlds]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]]]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195501.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's 1950 novella \"The Devil with You\" was retitled \"Black Magic Holiday\" when it was reprinted in ''[[Imaginative Tales]]'' in 1955.]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195503.jpg|thumb|right|However, Bloch's 1942 novella \"Mr. Margate's Mermaid\" retained its original title when it was reprinted later in 1955.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195806.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"Terror in Cut-Throat Cove\" was the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195905.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Hungry Eye\" was cover-featured on the May 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195907.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Last Plea\" was the cover story for the July 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 196001.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Funnel of God\" took the cover of the January 1960 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in ''[[Unknown Worlds]]'' first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the [[Damon Runyon]]-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' (April 1942). Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in ''Fantastic Adventures'', the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel ''In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments'',<ref>\"Lefty Feep and I\" in Bloch's ''Out of My head''. Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986, 125\u201330.</ref> Bloch also worked for a time in local [[vaudeville]] and tried to break into writing for nationally known performers.\n\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\",  (''Weird Tales'', July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments.<ref name=casebook>{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-bloch.html |title=Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper |first= Eduardo |last=Zinna |work=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}</ref> It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 adapted by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the [[Marquis de Sade]] (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and [[Lizzie Borden]] (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\n\nIn 1944, [[Laird Cregar]] performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network<ref>Jacket copy (front flap) Robert Bloch. ''The opener of the Way.'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1945.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called ''Stay Tuned for Terror''. Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (None of the episodes, which were all broadcast, are extant).<ref>For further information see \"Stay Tuned for Terror\" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''. Cambridge MA; NESFA Press, 1986, 33\u201341</ref>[http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/staytuned.html][http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Stay-Tuned-For-Terror.html]. The same year he published \"The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]\" (''Weird Tales,'' Sept). [[August Derleth]]'s [[Arkham House]], Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, ''The Opener of the Way'', in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by [[Ronald Clyne]]. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (''Weird Tales'', Sept) and ''[[Lizzie Borden]] Took an Axe'' (''Weird Tales'', Nov).\n\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover - the thriller ''The Scarf'' ([[Dial Press|The Dial Press]] 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in [[Minneapolis]] and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and finally [[Hollywood]], where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\n\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon I]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], [[Toronto]], Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\"(Weird Tales, Jan).\n\nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 ''Spiderweb'', ''The Kidnapper'' and ''The Will to Kill'' as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panellist on the TV quiz show ''It's a Draw''. ''Shooting Star'' (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled ''Terror in the Night''. ''This Crowded Earth'' (1958) was science fiction.\n\nWith the demise of ''Weird Tales'', Bloch continued to have his fiction published in ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Fantastic]]'', ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Universe]]''; he was a particularly frequent contributor to ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'' and ''[[Imaginative Tales]]''. His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in ''[[The Saint (magazine)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'' and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as ''Shock''.\n\n===Jack the Ripper===\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 science fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' was a story, \"[[A Toy for Juliette]]\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the [[Marquis de Sade]] in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series episode \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\". His 1984 novel ''Night of the Ripper'' is set during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] and follows the investigation of Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] within the storyline.\n\n===''Psycho''===\nBloch won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]  for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, ''Psycho,'' was published.  Bloch had written an earlier short story involving [[dissociative identity disorder]], \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 ''Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine'', that foreshadowed the 1959 novel ''Psycho''. However, ''Psycho'' also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay.\" Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume ''The Science Fiction Novel'' (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in ''Fantastic'' (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[Norman Bates]], the main character in ''Psycho'', was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in ''Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3'').  Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of [[Lin Carter]]) and [[Chris Steinbrunner]], as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmonster.com/horror29.html|title=THE ASTOUNDING B MONSTER - HORROR|author=|date=|website=www.bmonster.com}}</ref> Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary ''Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield'', which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself - a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America - rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"<ref>Robert Bloch. \"Building the Bates Motel\". ''Mystery Scene'', No 40 (1993):19, 26, 27, 58.</ref>\n\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film version of his novel]], which was directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] from an adapted screenplay by [[Joseph Stefano]], he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special [[Mystery Writers of America]] scroll for the novel in 1961.\n\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to [[Douglas E. Winter]] in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during [[World War II]] and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|title=DarkEcho/HorrorOnline: Robert Bloch: Behind the Bates Motel|author=|date=|website=www.darkecho.com}}</ref> While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\n\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with [[Simon & Schuster]] included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\n\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the ''Psycho'' series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\n\nThe film ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of ''Psycho''. Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\n\n===The early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction===\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the [[Macdonald Carey]] vehicle, ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]'', (penning five episodes) as well as one for ''[[Whispering Smith]]''. Further TV work included an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of ''[[Thriller (US TV series)|Thriller]]'' (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1960\u201362). His short story collection ''Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares'' was published by Arkham House in 1960.\n\nBloch wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'' (1962), which is only very loosely related to [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|the 1920 German silent film]], and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\" for ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. The episode was shelved when the [[NBC television|NBC Television Network]] and sponsor [[Revlon]] called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to [[public domain]] status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free [[video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-sorcerers-apprentice-181237|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerer's Apprentice (1962) - Joseph Leytis|author=|date=|website=AllMovie}}</ref><ref>Grams, Martin and Patrik Winstrom, ''The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion'' c. 2001, OTR Publishing, Churchville, Maryland, {{ISBN|0-9703310-1-0}} (pp. 385\u2013388)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/suppressed/sorcerer.asp|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice|author=|date=August 16, 2013|website=snopes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AlfredHitchcockPresentsTheSorcerersApprentice|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerers Apprentice|last=FreeBmovies|date=|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including ''The Dead Beat'' (1960), and ''Firebug '' (1961), for which [[Harlan Ellison]], then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words.<ref>The novel ''Blood Runs Cold'' also appeared in 1961.{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=255}}</ref> In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel ''The Couch'' (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=270}}</ref> That year several Bloch short story collections- ''Atoms and Evil'', ''More Nightmares'' and ''Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper'' were published, as well as another novel, ''Terror'' (whose working titles included ''Amok'' and ''Kill for Kali''). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as ''The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing'' (Advent Publishers). In this era, [[Stephen King]] later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as ''The Deadbeat'', ''The Scarf'', ''Firebug'', ''Psycho'', and ''The Couch'' was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by [[James M. Cain|James Cain]].\"<ref>Stephen King, \"A Profile of Robert Bloch\". ''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, ''Bogey men'' and ''Horror-7''. In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by [[William Castle]], ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (also 1964), along with ''[[The Skull (film)|The Skull]]'' (1965).The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s: Film & TV writing===\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included ''The Alfred Hitchcock Hour'' (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Dennis R.|author2=Carl H.

He penned three scripts for the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\", \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\" (another [[Jack the Ripper]] variant), and \"[[Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Catspaw]]\".\n\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English [[Hammer Films]] series ''[[Journey to the Unknown]]'' for [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie ''[[Journey to Midnight]]'' (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams,\" co-scripted with [[Michael J. Bird]] and based on the eponymous story by [[Richard Matheson]].\n\nFollowing the movie ''[[The Skull]]'' (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by [[Milton Subotsky]], he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by [[Amicus Productions]] \u2013 ''[[The Psychopath]]'' (1966), ''[[The Deadly Bees]]'' (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' (also 1967), ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]'' (1971) and ''[[Asylum (1972 horror film)|Asylum]]'' (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director [[Curtis Harrington]] \u2013 ''[[The Cat Creature]]'' (1973) (an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'') and ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]''. ''The Cat Creature'' was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), the [[Val Lewton]]-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess ([[Bastet|Bast]]), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\"<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 360</ref> A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 360\u201363</ref>\n\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for ''[[Night Gallery]]'' (1971), ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' (1972), ''[[The Manhunter]]'' (1974), and ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'' (1976).\n\n===The later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction===\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''. 1966 saw Bloch win the [[Ann Radcliffe]] Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - ''Chamber of Horrors''. Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]'') only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.<ref name=\"First World Fantasy Convention p. 8\">\"Time-Travelling with H. P. Lovecraft\" in ''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press), p. 8</ref>\n\nIn 1967, another Bloch collection, ''The Living Demons'' was issued. He also published another classic story of [[Jack the Ripper]], \"A Toy for Juliette\" in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day''. His novel ''The Star Stalker'' was published, and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\n\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''.

In 1968, a duo of long science fiction novellas appeared as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day'', as did his novel ''The Star Stalker'' and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories from Mirage Press in hardback). ''Ladies Day/This Crowded Earth'' and ''The Star Stalker'' followed in 1968. The collection ''Bloch and Bradbury'' (a collaboration with [[Ray Bradbury]]) and the hardcover novel ''The Todd Dossier'', originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\n\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969. That same year,<!-- 1969 --> Bloch was invited to the Second International Film Festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]], March 23\u201331, along with other science fiction writers from the United States, Britain and Europe.<ref>[[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]] wrote an essay, \"Report\", for ''Luna 6'', 1969, which also appeared as \"The Jos\u00e9s from Rio\" in ''Pearls From Peoria'', Subterranean Press, 2006. {{cite web |quote= The article begins as Phil and fellow scifi authors [[Alfred Bester]], [[Arthur C.

In 1972 he published another novel, ''Night-World''. In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon II]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel ''American Gothic'', inspired by the true life story of serial killer [[H.H. Holmes]].\n\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First [[World Fantasy Convention]] held in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The award was a bust of H.P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence.<ref>''Time-Travelling with H. P. Lovecraft''in ''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press), p. 7</ref> An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online at  [https://archive.org/details/FirstWorldFantasyConvention1975]\n\nIn 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings - ''Gravely, Robert Bloch!\" and ''Blood! The Life and Times of jack the Ripper!\"(with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, [[Lester del Rey]] edited ''The Best of Robert Bloch'' for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared - ''Cold Chills'' and ''The King of Terrors.''\n\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His ''Selected Stories'' (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title ''The Complete Stories'') appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent,\" set in [[Andre Norton]]'s Witch World, to ''Tales of the Witch World'' (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (also reissued as ''The Cunning''), and two more short story collections, ''Out of the Mouths of graves'' and ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.''\n\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction - ''Sneak Preview'' (1971) - through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute ''Strange Eons'' (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (1979);\n\n===The 1980s===\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (one episode, 1980), ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]'' (two episodes,1981), ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1 episode, 1986), ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (three episodes, 1984\u201387 - \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody needs a Little Love\") and ''[[Monsters (TV series)|Monsters]]'' (three episodes, 1988\u20131989 - \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with [[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' in 1998.\n\n''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, [[T. E. D. Klein|T.E.D. Klein]] and [[Fritz Leiber]]. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]-themed collection ''Mysteries of the Worm''. This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\n\nBloch's sequel to the original ''Psycho'' (''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' was published in 1982 (unrelated to the film of the same title) and in 1983 he novelised ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. His novel ''[[Night of the Ripper]]'' (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\n\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus ''Unholy Trinity'', collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, ''The Scarf'', ''The Dead Beat'' and ''The Couch.'' A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as ''Out of My Head.''\n\nIn 1987,  Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set ''The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch'' (individual volumes titled ''Final reckonings'', ''Bitter Ends'' and ''Last Rites''). When Citadel press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it ''The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.'' The same year a collection, ''Midnight Pleasures'' appeared from Doubleday, and ''Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep'' (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, however the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, ''The Kidnapper.'\n\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection, ''Fear and Trembling'', the thriller novel ''Lori'' (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, ''Screams'' (containing ''The Will to Kill'', ''Firebug'' and ''The Star Stalker''). Randall D. Larson issued ''The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986'' (Starmont House), together with ''Robert Bloch'' (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and ''The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography'' (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\n\n===The 1990s: Last works===\nBloch's novel, ''The Jekyll Legacy'' (1990), was a collaboration with [[Andre Norton]] and a sequel to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.  The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with ''Psycho House'' (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled ''Psycho III''. It would prove to be his last published novel.\n\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first [[World Horror Convention]] held in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with [[Martin H. Greenberg]] the original anthology ''Psycho-Paths'' (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to ''In Search of Lovecraft'' by [[J. Vernon Shea]].\n\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", ''Once Around the Bloch'' (Tor) and edited the original anthology ''Monsters in Our Midst''.\n\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, ''The Early Fears''. Bloch began editing a new original anthology, ''[[Robert Bloch's Psychos]]'' but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=158}}</ref> During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) [[tuberculosis]] of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=215\u2013217}}</ref>\n\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to [[Weyauwega, Wisconsin|Weyauwega]], Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\n\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko) \u2014 who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier \u2014 and made her his second wife in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=308\u2013309}}</ref> They honeymooned in [[Tahiti]], and in 1965 visited London, then [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=304\u2013313}}</ref> They remained happily married until Bloch's death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]], Canada.  Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch's in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.\n\nBloch died on 23 September 1994 after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |title=Robert Bloch |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230952/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft\">{{cite web|url=http://alangullette.com/lit/hpl/bloch.htm|title=Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft|author=|date=|website=alangullette.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/RobertBloch.html|title=Robert Bloch|author=|date=|website=www.tabula-rasa.info}}</ref> in Los Angeles after a writing career lasting 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film.

He is best known as the writer of ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1959), the basis for the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film of the same name]] by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. His fondness for a [[pun]] is evident in the titles of his story collections such as ''Tales in a Jugular Vein'', ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of'' and ''Out of the Mouths of Graves''.\n\nBloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle and began his professional writing career immediately after graduation, aged 17. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while Bloch started his career by emulating Lovecraft and his brand of \"[[cosmic horror]]\", he later specialized in crime and horror stories dealing with a more psychological approach.\n\nBloch was a contributor to [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to [[science fiction fanzine]]s and [[fandom]] in general.\n\nHe won the [[Hugo Award]] (for his story \"[[That Hell-Bound Train]]\"), the [[Bram Stoker Award]], and the [[World Fantasy Award]]. He served a term as president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]] (1970) and was a member of that organization and of [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], the [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of [[Ed Gein]]\" (1962)<ref>The essay was previously collected in ''The Lost Bloch, Volume Three: Crimes and Punishments'' (2002) {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?995871 |title= Bibliography: The Shambles of Ed Gein |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American [[true crime]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=289&section=toc |author= [[Library of America]] |title= True Crime: An American Anthology |publisher= Library of America |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis favorites among his own novels were ''The Kidnapper'', ''The Star Stalker'', ''Psycho'', ''Night-World,'' and ''Strange Eons''.<ref name=Larson>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Randall |title= The Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969\u20131986|year=1989 |publisher=Starmont House |isbn=1-55742-147-1}}</ref> His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of [[Germans|German]] [[Jewish]] descent. Bloch's family moved to [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the [[Methodist Church]] there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and attended Emerson Grammar School.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography''. NY: Tor, 1993, p. 30</ref> In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror.<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\">''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', April 6, 1935.</ref><ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\">Reprint of 1949 autobiographical article in Graeme Flanagan, ''Robert Bloch: A Bio-Bibliography''. Canberra: Flanagan, 1979, pp. 6-12</ref> Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the Public Library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead [[toy soldiers]] and for [[silent cinema]].<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to [[Milwaukee]], where Stella worked at the [[Lizzie Black Kander|Milwaukee Jewish Settlement]] [[settlement house]]. Robert attended Washington, then [[Lincoln High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Lincoln High School]], where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of ''The Quill'', Lincoln's [[literary magazine]], and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was [[Death (personification)|Death]]). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\"/> during the height of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\n\n==Career==\n===''Weird Tales'' magazine and the influence of H. P.

In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked ''Weird Tales'' (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/><ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed).

''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), p. 15</ref> The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. ''Weird Tales'' cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new ''Weird Tales'' issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9.<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> His parents were not impressed with [[Hugh Doak Rankin]]'s sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukeee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading ''Weird Tales'' during convalescence from flu.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]], a frequent contributor to ''Weird Tales'', became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"[[Pickman's Model]],\" in ''Weird Tales'' for October 1927.<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\">Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 49.</ref> Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell|James Lowell]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].

Barlow]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Donald Wandrei]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry S. Whitehead]], [[E. Hoffman Price]], [[Bernard Austin Dwyer]] and [[J. Vernon Shea]]. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies,\" \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to ''Weird Tales''; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine ''Marvel Tales'' (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in ''[[Unusual Stories]]'' (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 50</ref>\n\nBloch graduated from high school in June, 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to ''Weird Tales.'' Bloch's first publication in ''Weird Tales'' was a letter criticising the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories of [[Robert E. Howard]]. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to ''Weird Tales,'' were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?59533 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Feast in the Abbey |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?63765 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Secret in the Tomb |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of [[Arkham House]]).<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 80.</ref> Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn't even smoke.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met [[Farnsworth Wright]], the then editor of ''Weird Tales''. He also met the first ''Weird Tales'' writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - [[Otto Binder]].<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 49</ref>\n\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features [[Nyarlathotep]]; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'' and ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Cultes des Goules|Cultes des Goules]]''. Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume ''Mysteries of the Worm'' (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in ''[[Something About Cats and Other Pieces]]''.\n\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character [[Robert Harrison Blake|Robert Blake]] in Lovecraft's story \"[[The Haunter of the Dark]]\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"[[The Shambler from the Stars (Short Story)|The Shambler from the Stars]]\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.loa.org/2010/09/what-robert-bloch-owes-to-h-p-lovecraft.html |author= [[Library of America]] |date= September 23, 2010 |title= What Robert Bloch owes to H. P. Lovecraft |publisher= Reader's Almanac: The Official Blog of the [[Library of America]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft [and some of his creations] giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\">\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 51</ref> Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (''Weird Tales'' Sept 1950).\n\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization,  even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" <ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\"/> Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for ''Weird Tales'', where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the [[conte cruel]] (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), [[demonic possession]] (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and [[black magic]] (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited [[Henry Kuttner]] in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\", was published in ''Amazing Stories'' (August 1938).\n\n===Milwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression===\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Ralph Milne Farley]] and [[Raymond A. Palmer]]. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with [[C.L. Moore]] and her husband [[Henry Kuttner]], who visited him in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians [[Stoopnagle and Budd]], and to [[Roy Atwell]]. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in ''Weird Tales'' (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\n\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' for April. ''Weird Tales'' published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in ''Amazing Stories'' (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".<ref>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', August 1938, p.146</ref>\n\n=== Campaign manager for Carl Zeidler ===\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for [[List of mayors of Milwaukee|Mayor of Milwaukee]] of a little-known assistant city attorney named [[Carl Zeidler]]. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, ''Once Around the Bloch'', he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries.

If I had not written a little [[vampire]] story called \"The Cloak\", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.}}\n\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (''Amazing Stories,'' August) and \"The Cloak\" (''Unknown,'' March).\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Fantastic adventures 195008.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Devil With You\" was the cover story in the July 1950 issue of ''Fantastic Adventures''.]]\n[[File:Imagination 195106.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novella \"Hell's Angel\" was the cover story in the June 1951 issue of ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]].]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's completion of the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\" was touted by ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' as \"A New Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece\".]]\n[[File:Other worlds 195306.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Thinking Cap\" was the cover story in the June 1953 issue of ''[[Other Worlds Science Stories|Other Worlds]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]]]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195501.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's 1950 novella \"The Devil with You\" was retitled \"Black Magic Holiday\" when it was reprinted in ''[[Imaginative Tales]]'' in 1955.]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195503.jpg|thumb|right|However, Bloch's 1942 novella \"Mr. Margate's Mermaid\" retained its original title when it was reprinted later in 1955.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195806.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"Terror in Cut-Throat Cove\" was the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195905.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Hungry Eye\" was cover-featured on the May 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195907.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Last Plea\" was the cover story for the July 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 196001.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Funnel of God\" took the cover of the January 1960 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in ''[[Unknown Worlds]]'' first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the [[Damon Runyon]]-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' (April 1942). Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in ''Fantastic Adventures'', the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel ''In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments'',<ref>\"Lefty Feep and I\" in Bloch's ''Out of My head''. Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986, 125\u201330.</ref> Bloch also worked for a time in local [[vaudeville]] and tried to break into writing for nationally known performers.\n\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\",  (''Weird Tales'', July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments.<ref name=casebook>{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-bloch.html |title=Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper |first= Eduardo |last=Zinna |work=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}</ref> It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 adapted by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the [[Marquis de Sade]] (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and [[Lizzie Borden]] (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\n\nIn 1944, [[Laird Cregar]] performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network<ref>Jacket copy (front flap) Robert Bloch. ''The opener of the Way.'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1945.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called ''Stay Tuned for Terror''. Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (None of the episodes, which were all broadcast, are extant).<ref>For further information see \"Stay Tuned for Terror\" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''. Cambridge MA; NESFA Press, 1986, 33\u201341</ref>[http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/staytuned.html][http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Stay-Tuned-For-Terror.html]. The same year he published \"The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]\" (''Weird Tales,'' Sept). [[August Derleth]]'s [[Arkham House]], Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, ''The Opener of the Way'', in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by [[Ronald Clyne]]. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (''Weird Tales'', Sept) and ''[[Lizzie Borden]] Took an Axe'' (''Weird Tales'', Nov).\n\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover - the thriller ''The Scarf'' ([[Dial Press|The Dial Press]] 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in [[Minneapolis]] and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and finally [[Hollywood]], where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\n\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon I]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], [[Toronto]], Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\"(Weird Tales, Jan).\n\nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 ''Spiderweb'', ''The Kidnapper'' and ''The Will to Kill'' as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panellist on the TV quiz show ''It's a Draw''. ''Shooting Star'' (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled ''Terror in the Night''. ''This Crowded Earth'' (1958) was science fiction.\n\nWith the demise of ''Weird Tales'', Bloch continued to have his fiction published in ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Fantastic]]'', ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Universe]]''; he was a particularly frequent contributor to ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'' and ''[[Imaginative Tales]]''. His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in ''[[The Saint (magazine)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'' and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as ''Shock''.\n\n===Jack the Ripper===\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 science fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' was a story, \"[[A Toy for Juliette]]\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the [[Marquis de Sade]] in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series episode \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\". His 1984 novel ''Night of the Ripper'' is set during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] and follows the investigation of Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] within the storyline.\n\n===''Psycho''===\nBloch won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]  for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, ''Psycho,'' was published.  Bloch had written an earlier short story involving [[dissociative identity disorder]], \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 ''Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine'', that foreshadowed the 1959 novel ''Psycho''. However, ''Psycho'' also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay.\" Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume ''The Science Fiction Novel'' (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in ''Fantastic'' (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[Norman Bates]], the main character in ''Psycho'', was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in ''Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3'').  Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of [[Lin Carter]]) and [[Chris Steinbrunner]], as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmonster.com/horror29.html|title=THE ASTOUNDING B MONSTER - HORROR|author=|date=|website=www.bmonster.com}}</ref> Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary ''Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield'', which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself - a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America - rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"<ref>Robert Bloch. \"Building the Bates Motel\". ''Mystery Scene'', No 40 (1993):19, 26, 27, 58.</ref>\n\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film version of his novel]], which was directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] from an adapted screenplay by [[Joseph Stefano]], he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special [[Mystery Writers of America]] scroll for the novel in 1961.\n\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to [[Douglas E. Winter]] in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during [[World War II]] and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|title=DarkEcho/HorrorOnline: Robert Bloch: Behind the Bates Motel|author=|date=|website=www.darkecho.com}}</ref> While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\n\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with [[Simon & Schuster]] included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\n\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the ''Psycho'' series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\n\nThe film ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of ''Psycho''. Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\n\n===The early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction===\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the [[Macdonald Carey]] vehicle, ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]'', (penning five episodes) as well as one for ''[[Whispering Smith]]''. Further TV work included an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of ''[[Thriller (US TV series)|Thriller]]'' (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1960\u201362). His short story collection ''Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares'' was published by Arkham House in 1960.\n\nBloch wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'' (1962), which is only very loosely related to [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|the 1920 German silent film]], and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\" for ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. The episode was shelved when the [[NBC television|NBC Television Network]] and sponsor [[Revlon]] called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to [[public domain]] status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free [[video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-sorcerers-apprentice-181237|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerer's Apprentice (1962) - Joseph Leytis|author=|date=|website=AllMovie}}</ref><ref>Grams, Martin and Patrik Winstrom, ''The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion'' c. 2001, OTR Publishing, Churchville, Maryland, {{ISBN|0-9703310-1-0}} (pp. 385\u2013388)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/suppressed/sorcerer.asp|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice|author=|date=August 16, 2013|website=snopes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AlfredHitchcockPresentsTheSorcerersApprentice|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerers Apprentice|last=FreeBmovies|date=|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including ''The Dead Beat'' (1960), and ''Firebug '' (1961), for which [[Harlan Ellison]], then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words.<ref>The novel ''Blood Runs Cold'' also appeared in 1961.{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=255}}</ref> In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel ''The Couch'' (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=270}}</ref> That year several Bloch short story collections- ''Atoms and Evil'', ''More Nightmares'' and ''Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper'' were published, as well as another novel, ''Terror'' (whose working titles included ''Amok'' and ''Kill for Kali''). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as ''The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing'' (Advent Publishers). In this era, [[Stephen King]] later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as ''The Deadbeat'', ''The Scarf'', ''Firebug'', ''Psycho'', and ''The Couch'' was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by [[James M. Cain|James Cain]].\"<ref>Stephen King, \"A Profile of Robert Bloch\". ''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, ''Bogey men'' and ''Horror-7''. In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by [[William Castle]], ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (also 1964), along with ''[[The Skull (film)|The Skull]]'' (1965).The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s: Film & TV writing===\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included ''The Alfred Hitchcock Hour'' (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Dennis R.|author2=Carl H.

He penned three scripts for the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\", \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\" (another [[Jack the Ripper]] variant), and \"[[Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Catspaw]]\".\n\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English [[Hammer Films]] series ''[[Journey to the Unknown]]'' for [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie ''[[Journey to Midnight]]'' (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams,\" co-scripted with [[Michael J. Bird]] and based on the eponymous story by [[Richard Matheson]].\n\nFollowing the movie ''[[The Skull]]'' (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by [[Milton Subotsky]], he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by [[Amicus Productions]] \u2013 ''[[The Psychopath]]'' (1966), ''[[The Deadly Bees]]'' (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' (also 1967), ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]'' (1971) and ''[[Asylum (1972 horror film)|Asylum]]'' (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director [[Curtis Harrington]] \u2013 ''[[The Cat Creature]]'' (1973) (an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'') and ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]''. ''The Cat Creature'' was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), the [[Val Lewton]]-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess ([[Bastet|Bast]]), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\"<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 360</ref> A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 360\u201363</ref>\n\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for ''[[Night Gallery]]'' (1971), ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' (1972), ''[[The Manhunter]]'' (1974), and ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'' (1976).\n\n===The later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction===\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''. 1966 saw Bloch win the [[Ann Radcliffe]] Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - ''Chamber of Horrors''. Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]'') only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.<ref name=\"First World Fantasy Convention p. 8\">\"Time-Travelling with H.

He also published another classic story of [[Jack the Ripper]], \"A Toy for Juliette\" in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day''. His novel ''The Star Stalker'' was published, and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\n\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''.

The collection ''Bloch and Bradbury'' (a collaboration with [[Ray Bradbury]]) and the hardcover novel ''The Todd Dossier'', originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\n\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969.

In 1972 he published another novel, ''Night-World''. In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon II]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel ''American Gothic'', inspired by the true life story of serial killer [[H.H. Holmes]].\n\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First [[World Fantasy Convention]] held in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The award was a bust of H.P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence.<ref>''Time-Travelling with H. P.

Two further short story collections appeared - ''Cold Chills'' and ''The King of Terrors.''\n\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His ''Selected Stories'' (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title ''The Complete Stories'') appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent,\" set in [[Andre Norton]]'s Witch World, to ''Tales of the Witch World'' (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (also reissued as ''The Cunning''), and two more short story collections, ''Out of the Mouths of graves'' and ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.''\n\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction - ''Sneak Preview'' (1971) - through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute ''Strange Eons'' (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (1979);\n\n===The 1980s===\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (one episode, 1980), ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]'' (two episodes,1981), ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1 episode, 1986), ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (three episodes, 1984\u201387 - \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody needs a Little Love\") and ''[[Monsters (TV series)|Monsters]]'' (three episodes, 1988\u20131989 - \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with [[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' in 1998.\n\n''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, [[T. E. D. Klein|T.E.D. Klein]] and [[Fritz Leiber]]. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]-themed collection ''Mysteries of the Worm''. This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\n\nBloch's sequel to the original ''Psycho'' (''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' was published in 1982 (unrelated to the film of the same title) and in 1983 he novelised ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. His novel ''[[Night of the Ripper]]'' (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\n\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus ''Unholy Trinity'', collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, ''The Scarf'', ''The Dead Beat'' and ''The Couch.'' A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as ''Out of My Head.''\n\nIn 1987,  Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set ''The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch'' (individual volumes titled ''Final reckonings'', ''Bitter Ends'' and ''Last Rites''). When Citadel press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it ''The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.'' The same year a collection, ''Midnight Pleasures'' appeared from Doubleday, and ''Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep'' (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, however the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, ''The Kidnapper.'\n\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection, ''Fear and Trembling'', the thriller novel ''Lori'' (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, ''Screams'' (containing ''The Will to Kill'', ''Firebug'' and ''The Star Stalker''). Randall D. Larson issued ''The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986'' (Starmont House), together with ''Robert Bloch'' (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and ''The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography'' (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\n\n===The 1990s: Last works===\nBloch's novel, ''The Jekyll Legacy'' (1990), was a collaboration with [[Andre Norton]] and a sequel to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.  The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with ''Psycho House'' (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled ''Psycho III''. It would prove to be his last published novel.\n\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first [[World Horror Convention]] held in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with [[Martin H. Greenberg]] the original anthology ''Psycho-Paths'' (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to ''In Search of Lovecraft'' by [[J. Vernon Shea]].\n\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", ''Once Around the Bloch'' (Tor) and edited the original anthology ''Monsters in Our Midst''.\n\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, ''The Early Fears''. Bloch began editing a new original anthology, ''Robert Bloch's Psychos'' but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=158}}</ref> During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) [[tuberculosis]] of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=215\u2013217}}</ref>\n\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to [[Weyauwega, Wisconsin|Weyauwega]], Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\n\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko) \u2014 who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier \u2014 and made her his second wife in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=308\u2013309}}</ref> They honeymooned in [[Tahiti]], and in 1965 visited London, then [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=304\u2013313}}</ref> They remained happily married until Bloch's death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]], Canada.  Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch's in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.\n\nBloch died on 23 September 1994 after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |title=Robert Bloch |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230952/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft\">{{cite web|url=http://alangullette.com/lit/hpl/bloch.htm|title=Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft|author=|date=|website=alangullette.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/RobertBloch.html|title=Robert Bloch|author=|date=|website=www.tabula-rasa.info}}</ref> in Los Angeles after a writing career lasting 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film.
