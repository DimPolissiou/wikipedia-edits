The animal was described as being around five feet, or one and a half meters, long, with a dog-like head, long drooping whiskers; an elongated but robust body, thick fur coat, no limbs but two tail fins much like a shark. He described the creature as being playful and inquisitive, much like a monkey. After observing it for two hours, he attempted to shoot and collect the creature, but missed, and the creature swam away. A similar creature was seen in June, 1965, by sailor [[Miles Smeeton]] and company off [[Atka Island]], Alaska.\n\nThere have been four attempts to scientifically classify the creature, [[species description|described]] as ''Simia marina'', ''Siren cynocephala'', ''Trichechus hydropithecus'', and ''Manatus simia''. Steller most likely simply misidentified a [[Northern fur seal]].\n\n==Accounts==\n===Original account===\n====Observations====\n{{Location map+ | Alaska\n| relief  = 2\n| width   = 250\n| float   = right\n| caption = Locations of purported sightings\n| places =\n{{Location map~ | Alaska\n |Alaska\n |label=Shumagin Islands\n |link=Shumagin Islands\n |lat=55.228056\n |long=-160.018056\n |position=right\n}}\n{{Location map~ | Alaska\n |Alaska\n |label=Atka Island\n |link=Atka Island\n |lat=52.13806\n |long=-174.4453\n |position=right\n}}\n}}\nGerman zoologist [[Georg Steller]] was onboard the ''St. Peter'' on [[Vitus Bering]]'s [[Great Northern Expedition]] from 1733\u20131743, and [[species description|described]] several new species during the voyage. At around sunset on August 10, 1741, around [[Shumagin Islands]], Alaska, Steller reported a strange and unidentifiable creature floating near the ship.<ref name=Stellar1742>{{cite book|first=G. W.|last=Steller|authorlink=Georg Wilhelm Steller|title=Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741\u20131742|editor1-first=O.|editor1-last=Frost|translator-first=M.|translator-last=Engel|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=82\u201383|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=VtJY90BJ1yMC|page=79}}|isbn=978-0-8047-2181-3|year=1993}}</ref> \n\nThe creature purportedly stared at the ship for 2 hours\u2013according to Steller, seemingly out of admiration\u2013and got so close to the ship that it could have been poked by a pole. However, he said that whenever the crew attempted to approach the creature, it would swim farther out. He said it raised a third of its body out of the water, maintaining a human-like posture, for several minutes. After a half hour, the creature dove under the water and swam underneath the ship to the other side, and did this repeatedly about 30 times.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\nSteller stated that, when a large [[seaweed]] stalk about {{cvt|3\u20134|fathom|ft m}} long floated by, the creature quickly swam towards it and grabbed it with its mouth. The creature then swam closer to the ship and, purportedly, did juggling tricks with it like a trained monkey, though eating pieces of it now and again.<ref name=Stellar1742/> Steller's description of it as a sea-monkey probably stemmed more from such behavior rather than actual resemblance to a monkey.<ref name=Stejneger/>\n\nSteller attempted to collect the animal, so he took a gun and fired at it, but missed. He reported that the creature disappeared for a moment, but quickly came back, frightened, and once again gradually neared the ship. Steller fired at it again, but missed or only wounded the creature, which swam away. It was not seen again.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\n====Description====\nSteller reported the creature as being 2 [[ell]]s long, the combined length of the forearm and extended hand. It purportedly had a dog-like head, with pointed and erect ears, large eyes, and whiskers on the upper and lower lips resembling a [[Fu Manchu mustache]].<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\nHe described the body as being long and fat, thinning towards the tail. He said the creature had a thick fur coat, gray on the back and reddish-white on the belly. Steller did not see any forelimbs or pectoral fins. The tail apparently had two fins, the upper fin double the size of the lower fin, much like a shark.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\n===Other accounts===\nIn June 1965, on his [[ketch]] the ''Tzu Hang'', sailor [[Miles Smeeton]], his daughter Clio, and his friend Henry Combe purportedly saw a similar creature on the northern coast of [[Atka Island]]. They reported the creature as being about {{cvt|5|ft|m}} long, and having {{cvt|4\u20135|in|cm|adj=on}} reddish-yellow fur, and a face resembling that of a [[shih-tzu]]. He details this 10\u201315 second encounter in his book ''Misty Island'', and noted Steller's observations closely matched his own.<ref>{{cite book|first=M.|last=Smeeton|authorlink=Miles and Beryl Smeeton|year=1969|title=The Misty Islands|publisher=Grafton|pages=109\u2013110|isbn=978-0-246-13489-9}}</ref>\n\n==Research history==\n[[File:Animal drawings collected by Felix Platter, p1 - (31).jpg|upright|thumb|''Simia marina'' in [[Conrad Gessner]]'s ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia animalium]]'']]\nAll Steller's writings regarding his expedition were published posthumously, but most of his writings were lost. His account of the creature was detailed in his diary, published in 2 installments by Prussian zoologist [[Peter Simon Pallas]] in 1781 and 1793.<ref name=Stellar1742/> He also made a small note in his most famous book ''De Bestiis Marinus'', calling it an \"imperfect account\" for lack of a specimen:\n{{quote|text=I describe the traces of a certain unknown animal upon the island of Shumagin, and I insert a sketch of a sea ape, and with this imperfect account I must content myself and others.<ref>{{cite book|first=G.

He described the creature as being playful and inquisitive, much like a monkey. After observing it for two hours, he attempted to shoot and collect the creature, but missed, and the creature swam away. A similar creature was seen in June, 1965, by sailor [[Miles Smeeton]] and company off [[Atka Island]], Alaska.\n\nThere have been four attempts to scientifically classify the creature, [[species description|described]] as ''Simia marina'', ''Siren cynocephala'', ''Trichechus hydropithecus'', and ''Manatus simia''. Steller most likely simply misidentified a [[Northern fur seal]].\n\n==Accounts==\n===Original account===\n====Observations====\n{{Location map+ | Alaska\n| relief  = 2\n| width   = 250\n| float   = right\n| caption = Locations of purported sightings\n| places =\n{{Location map~ | Alaska\n |Alaska\n |label=Shumagin Islands\n |link=Shumagin Islands\n |lat=55.228056\n |long=-160.018056\n |position=right\n}}\n{{Location map~ | Alaska\n |Alaska\n |label=Atka Island\n |link=Atka Island\n |lat=52.13806\n |long=-174.4453\n |position=right\n}}\n}}\nGerman zoologist [[Georg Steller]] was onboard the ''St. Peter'' on [[Vitus Bering]]'s [[Great Northern Expedition]] from 1733\u20131743, and [[species description|described]] several new species during the voyage. At around sunset on August 10, 1741, around [[Shumagin Islands]], Alaska, Steller reported a strange and unidentifiable creature floating near the ship.<ref name=Stellar1742>{{cite book|first=G.

However, he said that whenever the crew attempted to approach the creature, it would swim farther out. He said it raised a third of its body out of the water, maintaining a human-like posture, for several minutes. After a half hour, the creature dove under the water and swam underneath the ship to the other side, and did this repeatedly about 30 times.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\nSteller stated that, when a large [[seaweed]] stalk about {{cvt|3\u20134|fathom|ft m}} long floated by, the creature quickly swam towards it and grabbed it with its mouth. The creature then swam closer to the ship and, purportedly, did juggling tricks with it like a trained monkey, though eating pieces of it now and again.<ref name=Stellar1742/> Steller's description of it as a sea-monkey probably stemmed more from such behavior rather than actual resemblance to a monkey.<ref name=Stejneger/>\n\nSteller attempted to collect the animal, so he took a gun and fired at it, but missed. He reported that the creature disappeared for a moment, but quickly came back, frightened, and once again gradually neared the ship. Steller fired at it again, but missed or only wounded the creature, which swam away. It was not seen again.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\n====Description====\nSteller reported the creature as being 2 [[ell]]s long, the combined length of the forearm and extended hand. It purportedly had a dog-like head, with pointed and erect ears, large eyes, and whiskers on the upper and lower lips resembling a [[Fu Manchu mustache]].<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\nHe described the body as being long and fat, thinning towards the tail. He said the creature had a thick fur coat, gray on the back and reddish-white on the belly. Steller did not see any forelimbs or pectoral fins. The tail apparently had two fins, the upper fin double the size of the lower fin, much like a shark.<ref name=Stellar1742/>\n\n===Other accounts===\nIn June 1965, on his [[ketch]] the ''Tzu Hang'', sailor [[Miles Smeeton]], his daughter Clio, and his friend Henry Combe purportedly saw a similar creature on the northern coast of [[Atka Island]]. They reported the creature as being about {{cvt|5|ft|m}} long, and having {{cvt|4\u20135|in|cm|adj=on}} reddish-yellow fur, and a face resembling that of a [[shih-tzu]].

Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before.

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chong's and those of other defendants and the DEA tactics used in the investigation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nParis Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that \"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOf the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain. She said, \"He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.\"<ref name=\"Tommy Chong's Bongs\">{{cite magazine |author=Greg Beato | title=Tommy Chong's Bongs| date=May 2004 | magazine= Reason Magazine| url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/29137.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring its investigation of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in western Pennsylvania. They asked Paris Chong to sell them [[Water pipe percolator|pipes]] through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in [[Western Pennsylvania]] because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong's prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong's illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]'', a parody of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''. His parole officer barred him from the show and the tour was cancelled, as audience members were smoking pot during performances.

The search was one of nine conducted for [[Operation True Test]], an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. It targeted companies that sell so-called \"masking products,\" intended to help drug-users pass employer drug tests. No federal law bans such products; they are regulated on a state-by-state basis.

Around this same time, Cheech and Chong appeared together on the internet-based, pro-marijuana show, [[Getting Doug With High]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1960, Chong married Maxine Sneed in Canada.

W. Bush]] and his wife, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Barbara Bush]]. After she was born in California, her family soon relocated to Texas, where Robin lived most of her life.\n\nAt the age of 3, Robin was diagnosed with advanced leukemia. As she was given very little time to live, her parents flew her to [[New York City]] for treatment, where she spent the next six months. Despite doctors' efforts, she died two months before her fourth birthday. Her death prompted them to establish a foundation for leukemia research.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Barabara Bush with her two children, 1950.jpg|thumb|165px|left|Barbara Bush with Robin and George W. Bush, in Texas, October 1950.]]\nThen an [[oil field]] equipment [[salesman]] for [[Dresser Industries]], [[George H. W.

W.'s mother pointed out that her initials would be P. P. Bush, which \"would never do\".{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=37}} From birth, the little girl was referred to as Robin, so much so that, later in life, Barbara would comment that Robin's siblings probably do not even remember her real name.{{sfn|Bush|2004|p=ix}}\n\nRobin was described as being calm and having a \"sweet soul\". She was \"quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls.\"<ref name=td1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.today.com/video/barbara-bush-child-lost-to-cancer-is-an-angel-to-me-44510275789?v=raila |title='Barbara Bush: Child lost to cancer is \u2018an angel to me\u2019 |last=Bush Hager |first=Jenna |date=2012-11-20 |website=Today |access-date=2018-08-27}}</ref> Her father would later say of Robin: \"She'd fight and cry and play and make her way just like the rest, but there was about her a certain softness... Her peace made me feel strong, and so very important.\"{{sfn|Green|2000|p=39}}\nIn 1950, shortly after Robin's birth, the family relocated again, this time to [[Midland, Texas]]; the family quickly became involved in their new town.{{sfn|Gutin|2008|p=13}} In February 1953, after having moved to their third house in Midland, the Bushes had another child, [[Jeb Bush|John Ellis]], nicknamed \"Jeb\".{{sfn|Bush|2015|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn the spring of 1953, shortly after Jeb's birth, Robin awoke one morning, listless.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=32}} She said she was unsure of what to do that particular morning, stating that she \"may go out and lie on the grass and watch the cars go by\", or just stay in bed. Barbara believed Robin had come down with what her mother had referred to as \"spring fever\",{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=39}} as, up until that point, she had been \"as rowdy and healthy\" as her brothers.<ref name=wp1 /> The child was taken to the family's pediatrician, Dorothy Wyvell, who took a blood sample and told Barbara to return later that afternoon with George H. W.; Barbara had not yet noticed the bruises on Robin.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=32}} Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage [[leukemia]]. Her advice for them was to not tell anyone about the child's illness, and to take her home, \"make life as easy as possible for her, and in three weeks' time, she'll be gone.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}} Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal.{{sfn|Blue|Naden|1991|p=52}}\n\n[[File:George H. W. Bush holding Robin.png|thumb|right|175px|George H. W. Bush holding Robin, 1953.]]\nThe Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the [[country club]] were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, [[John M. Walker]], president of [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center#Memorial Hospital and the Sloan Kettering Institute (1934\u20131980)|Memorial Hospital]] in [[New York City]]. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering Institute]]. He told George and Barbara that \"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}} The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=40}} George W. was told that his sister was sick, but was never explained exactly how bad her condition was.{{sfn|Marquez|2006|p=15}} For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George traveled back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}}\n\nRobin was, by her mother's account, \"wonderful\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked [[bone marrow examination|bone marrow tests]], which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=43}} At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete [[remission (medicine)|remission]]. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well.{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=92}} Barbara and George heard about a doctor in [[Kansas City]] who maintained he had found the cure for leukemia. However, their hopes were dashed when they found out the man was merely testing a new drug, and had not claimed to have the cure.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=42}}{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=93}} Sometimes, her parents would take Robin to the Bush house in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and she was once taken to [[Maine]] for a brief period. There, she got to see her brothers, whose pictures she had taped to the headboard of her hospital bed.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=43}} During this visit, George W. was not allowed to wrestle with his sister like they used to;{{sfn|Gormley|2000|p=10}} his mother focused most of her attention on Robin and would \"snap\" at him if he tried to \"horse around\" with his sister.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}}\n\nBy fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an [[oxygen tent]], and her [[platelet]]s were low enough that whenever she started bleeding, it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=34}} Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. [[Prescott Bush]], George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication,{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=44}} Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \"a hundred or so\" [[peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcer]]s.{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=94}} Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to his daughter's bedside, she had entered a coma. Robin died{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=44}} on October 11, 1953, after doctors' efforts to close the ulcers in her stomach.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=35}} She was two months short of her fourth birthday. Two days later, on October 13,{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=45}} a memorial service was held for Robin, at the Bushes' home in Greenwich. Initially, her body was donated for research, in hopes that her death might help others survive.{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=100}} Several days later, when the hospital released her remains, Dorothy Walker Bush, her paternal grandmother, was among those who buried her.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=45}} In 2000, her grave was exhumed and  her remains were relocated and reburied at the George H.W. Bush Library.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Robin Bush portrait, 1953.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The portrait of Robin that hung in the Bushes' Texas homes.]]\n{{multiple image\n |footer=<center>Robin's parents</center>\n |image1=George H.

W. Bush would later write.{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=102}} Barbara came to believe that she and her husband valued all people more because of the loss they suffered with Robin.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=47}} Barbara also attributed the premature graying of her hair to Robin's extended illness and death.<ref name=wp1 />\n\nDorothy Walker Bush commissioned an oil painting of Robin, which hung in the Bushes' homes in Midland and, later, [[Houston]].<ref name=wp1 />{{sfn|Sosa|Chase|2018|p=114}} Eventually, Barbara and George H. W. had three more children: [[Neil Bush|Neil]], in 1955, [[Marvin Bush|Marvin]] in 1956, and another daughter, [[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy]], known as \"Doro\" and born in 1959. Doro was once described by her father as \"a wild dark version of Robin\", noting that the two looked so much alike, his parents mistakenly called her Robin once.{{sfn|Parmet|2000|p=86}} In 2000, Robin's remains were transferred from Connecticut to the family's future burial plot at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in Texas. On this occasion, George H. W. stated: \"It seems funny after almost 50 years since her death how dear Robin is to our hearts.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=555}}\n\nFollowing Robin's death, the Bush family created a charity to raise awareness and money for leukemia research called the Bright Star Foundation.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=47}}\nThe impact of the Bright Star Foundation was acknowledged by the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in 2004, when it opened the Robin Bush Child and Adolescent Clinic.<ref name=\"LA Times 2013\">{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-to-george-bush-bald-leukemia-20130725-story.html| title=Bush's bald head a reminder of his own child's leukemia fight| last=Villeneuve| first=Marina| date=2013-07-16| work=Los Angeles Times| access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref> Barbara later became honorary chairwoman of the [[Leukemia & Lymphoma Society]] and honorary national chairperson of Donor Awareness Week.<ref name=\"Cunningham\">{{cite web| url=http://chatteringmind.com/articles/barbarabush.html| title=Good-Bye to Robin| website=Amy Cunningham| access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Barbara's death in April 2018, a cartoon by Marshall Ramsey, of ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'', was widely circulated, showing Robin greeting Barbara upon the latter's entry to heaven.

W. Bush]] and his wife, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Barbara Bush]]. After she was born in California, her family soon relocated to Texas, where Robin lived most of her life.\n\nAt the age of 3, Robin was diagnosed with advanced leukemia. As she was given very little time to live, her parents flew her to [[New York City]] for treatment, where she spent the next six months. Despite doctors' efforts, she died two months before her fourth birthday. Her death prompted them to establish a foundation for leukemia research.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Barabara Bush with her two children, 1950.jpg|thumb|165px|left|Barbara Bush with Robin and George W.

W.'s mother pointed out that her initials would be P. P. Bush, which \"would never do\".{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=37}} From birth, the little girl was referred to as Robin, so much so that, later in life, Barbara would comment that Robin's siblings probably do not even remember her real name.{{sfn|Bush|2004|p=ix}}\n\nRobin was described as being calm and having a \"sweet soul\". She was \"quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls.\"<ref name=td1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.today.com/video/barbara-bush-child-lost-to-cancer-is-an-angel-to-me-44510275789?v=raila |title='Barbara Bush: Child lost to cancer is \u2018an angel to me\u2019 |last=Bush Hager |first=Jenna |date=2012-11-20 |website=Today |access-date=2018-08-27}}</ref> Her father would later say of Robin: \"She'd fight and cry and play and make her way just like the rest, but there was about her a certain softness... Her peace made me feel strong, and so very important.\"{{sfn|Green|2000|p=39}}\nIn 1950, shortly after Robin's birth, the family relocated again, this time to [[Midland, Texas]]; the family quickly became involved in their new town.{{sfn|Gutin|2008|p=13}} In February 1953, after having moved to their third house in Midland, the Bushes had another child, [[Jeb Bush|John Ellis]], nicknamed \"Jeb\".{{sfn|Bush|2015|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn the spring of 1953, shortly after Jeb's birth, Robin awoke one morning, listless.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=32}} She said she was unsure of what to do that particular morning, stating that she \"may go out and lie on the grass and watch the cars go by\", or just stay in bed. Barbara believed Robin had come down with what her mother had referred to as \"spring fever\",{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=39}} as, up until that point, she had been \"as rowdy and healthy\" as her brothers.<ref name=wp1 /> The child was taken to the family's pediatrician, Dorothy Wyvell, who took a blood sample and told Barbara to return later that afternoon with George H. W.; Barbara had not yet noticed the bruises on Robin.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=32}} Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage [[leukemia]]. Her advice for them was to not tell anyone about the child's illness, and to take her home, \"make life as easy as possible for her, and in three weeks' time, she'll be gone.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}} Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal.{{sfn|Blue|Naden|1991|p=52}}\n\n[[File:George H. W. Bush holding Robin.png|thumb|right|175px|George H. W. Bush holding Robin, 1953.]]\nThe Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the [[country club]] were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, [[John M. Walker]], president of [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center#Memorial Hospital and the Sloan Kettering Institute (1934\u20131980)|Memorial Hospital]] in [[New York City]]. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering Institute]]. He told George and Barbara that \"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}} The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=40}} George W. was told that his sister was sick, but was never explained exactly how bad her condition was.{{sfn|Marquez|2006|p=15}} For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George traveled back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}}\n\nRobin was, by her mother's account, \"wonderful\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked [[bone marrow examination|bone marrow tests]], which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=43}} At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete [[remission (medicine)|remission]]. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well.{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=92}} Barbara and George heard about a doctor in [[Kansas City]] who maintained he had found the cure for leukemia. However, their hopes were dashed when they found out the man was merely testing a new drug, and had not claimed to have the cure.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=42}}{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=93}} Sometimes, her parents would take Robin to the Bush house in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and she was once taken to [[Maine]] for a brief period. There, she got to see her brothers, whose pictures she had taped to the headboard of her hospital bed.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=43}} During this visit, George W. was not allowed to wrestle with his sister like they used to;{{sfn|Gormley|2000|p=10}} his mother focused most of her attention on Robin and would \"snap\" at him if he tried to \"horse around\" with his sister.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=33}}\n\nBy fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an [[oxygen tent]], and her [[platelet]]s were low enough that whenever she started bleeding, it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=34}} Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. [[Prescott Bush]], George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication,{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=44}} Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \"a hundred or so\" [[peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcer]]s.{{sfn|Kilian|2003|p=94}} Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to his daughter's bedside, she had entered a coma. Robin died{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=44}} on October 11, 1953, after doctors' efforts to close the ulcers in her stomach.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=35}} She was two months short of her fourth birthday. Two days later, on October 13,{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=45}} a memorial service was held for Robin, at the Bushes' home in Greenwich. Initially, her body was donated for research, in hopes that her death might help others survive.{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=100}} Several days later, when the hospital released her remains, Dorothy Walker Bush, her paternal grandmother, was among those who buried her.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=45}} In 2000, her grave was exhumed and  her remains were relocated and reburied at the George H.W. Bush Library.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Robin Bush portrait, 1953.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The portrait of Robin that hung in the Bushes' Texas homes.]]\n{{multiple image\n |footer=<center>Robin's parents</center>\n |image1=George H.

Bush would later write.{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=102}} Barbara came to believe that she and her husband valued all people more because of the loss they suffered with Robin.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=47}} Barbara also attributed the premature graying of her hair to Robin's extended illness and death.<ref name=wp1 />\n\nDorothy Walker Bush commissioned an oil painting of Robin, which hung in the Bushes' homes in Midland and, later, [[Houston]].<ref name=wp1 />{{sfn|Sosa|Chase|2018|p=114}} Eventually, Barbara and George H. W. had three more children: [[Neil Bush|Neil]], in 1955, [[Marvin Bush|Marvin]] in 1956, and another daughter, [[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy]], known as \"Doro\" and born in 1959. Doro was once described by her father as \"a wild dark version of Robin\", noting that the two looked so much alike, his parents mistakenly called her Robin once.{{sfn|Parmet|2000|p=86}} In 2000, Robin's remains were transferred from Connecticut to the family's future burial plot at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in Texas. On this occasion, George H. W. stated: \"It seems funny after almost 50 years since her death how dear Robin is to our hearts.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2015|p=555}}\n\nFollowing Robin's death, the Bush family created a charity to raise awareness and money for leukemia research called the Bright Star Foundation.{{sfn|Bush|2015|p=47}}\nThe impact of the Bright Star Foundation was acknowledged by the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in 2004, when it opened the Robin Bush Child and Adolescent Clinic.<ref name=\"LA Times 2013\">{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-to-george-bush-bald-leukemia-20130725-story.html| title=Bush's bald head a reminder of his own child's leukemia fight| last=Villeneuve| first=Marina| date=2013-07-16| work=Los Angeles Times| access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref> Barbara later became honorary chairwoman of the [[Leukemia & Lymphoma Society]] and honorary national chairperson of Donor Awareness Week.<ref name=\"Cunningham\">{{cite web| url=http://chatteringmind.com/articles/barbarabush.html| title=Good-Bye to Robin| website=Amy Cunningham| access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Barbara's death in April 2018, a cartoon by Marshall Ramsey, of ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'', was widely circulated, showing Robin greeting Barbara upon the latter's entry to heaven.

He was also the host of a number of [[A&E Network|A&E]] crime and news documentary shows, including ''Investigative Reports'', ''[[American Justice]]'', and ''[[Cold Case Files]]''.  Previously, he anchored ''[[The Early Show#The CBS Morning News|The CBS Morning News]]'', and was the longtime anchor at [[WBBM-TV]], the [[CBS]]-owned and -operated TV station in Chicago. Kurtis is currently the scorekeeper/announcer for National Public Radio ([[NPR]])'s news comedy/quiz show ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'', as well as serving as the host of ''Through the Decades'', a documentary-style news magazine seen on [[CBS]]/[[Weigel Broadcasting|Weigel Broadcasting's]] digital multicast network, [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] syndicated subchannel.\n\n==Early life==\nKurtis was born in [[Pensacola, Florida]], to Wilma Mary Horton (1911\u20132002) and William A. Kuretich (Croatian: Kureti\u0107), of [[Croats|Croatian]] origin (1914\u20132001), a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[brigadier general]] and decorated veteran of [[World War II]]. His father's military career included extensive travel for his family.<ref name=\"documentary.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.documentary.org/feature/bill-kurtis-its-all-about-storytelling|title=Bill Kurtis: \"It's all about storytelling\"|work=International Documentary Association}}</ref>  Upon his retirement, the family settled in [[Independence, Kansas]].\n\nHis sister is former Kansas state Senate Majority Whip [[Jean Schodorf]], of [[Wichita, Kansas]].\n\nAt age 16, Kurtis began working as an announcer for [[KIND (AM)|KIND]], a radio station in Independence. He graduated from Independence High School in 1958, the [[University of Kansas]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[journalism]] in 1962 and he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Washburn University School of Law]] in 1966. While in law school he worked part time at [[WIBW-TV]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. After passing the Kansas bar examination and accepting a job with a [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] law firm, Kurtis discussed his options with Harry Colmery and Bob McClure of Colmery and Russell and decided not to pursue a career in law.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Television career===\nOn the evening of June 8, 1966, Kurtis left a bar review class at Washburn to fill in for a friend at WIBW-TV to anchor the 6&nbsp;o'clock news. Severe weather was approaching Topeka, so Kurtis stayed to update some weather reports. At 7:00&nbsp;p.m., while on the air, a tornado was sighted by WIBW cameraman Ed Rutherford southwest of the city.  Within 15 seconds another sighting came in: \"It's wiped out an apartment complex.\" Kurtis's warning \"For God's sake, take cover\" became synonymous with the [[June 1966 tornado outbreak sequence#Topeka, Kansas tornado|1966 Topeka tornado]] that left 16 dead and injured hundreds more.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Topeka Tornado - June 8, 1966 | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/top/events/66tornado.php| date = 31 Aug 2010| accessdate = 25 Jun 2013}}</ref> Kurtis and the WIBW broadcast team remained on the air for 24 straight hours to cover the initial tornado and its aftermath. Being the only television station in town and one of the few radio stations not damaged by the tornado, WIBW became a communications hub for emergency operations.  The experience changed Kurtis's career path from law to broadcast news.<ref name=\"documentary.org\"/>  Within three months, after seeing his work covering the tornado{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}, [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] hired Kurtis and set the stage for a 30-year career with [[CBS]].\n\nThe year 1966 in Chicago was the beginning of a tumultuous four years, and as a reporter and anchor Kurtis was in the middle of historic events.  He covered the neighborhood fires that followed the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and again when [[Robert Kennedy]] was shot.  The protests against the [[Vietnam War]] dominated the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, which Kurtis covered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amateurhumanist.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/dncchicago-40-years-later/|title=DNC/Chicago, 40 years later|work=Amateur Humanist}}</ref><ref name=\"documentary.org\"/> In 1969, Kurtis produced a documentary about [[Iva Toguri]], \"[[Tokyo Rose]],\" the first interview after her conviction for treason in 1949. His reporting, along with [[Ron Yates]] of the [[Chicago Tribune]], helped persuade President [[Gerald Ford]] to pardon her in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} His legal education came into play when he covered the [[Chicago Seven]] conspiracy trial in 1969, which led to a job with [[CBS News]] in [[Los Angeles]] as correspondent.  One of his first assignments was covering the [[Charles Manson]] murder trial for 10&nbsp;months. He also covered the murder trials of [[Angela Davis]] and [[Juan Corona]] and the [[Pentagon Papers]] trial of [[Daniel Ellsberg]].\n\nIn 1973, Kurtis returned to Chicago to co-anchor with [[Walter Jacobson]] at WBBM-TV.  In 1978, his investigative focus unit broke the [[Agent Orange]] story, U.S. veterans who were sprayed by the defoliant in [[Vietnam]].  After a dramatic screening of the documentary in Washington, D.C., the Veterans Administration issued guidelines to diagnose and compensate those veterans affected by Agent Orange.  Kurtis returned to Vietnam in 1980 to cover the Vietnamese side of the story and, while there, discovered some 15,000 Vietnamese children conceived and left behind by Americans when the U.S. left in 1975. A story Kurtis wrote for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' was instrumental in obtaining special status for the children to enter the [[United States]], where they live today.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Kurtis| first = Bill| title = The Plight of the Children ABANDONED IN VIETNAM; VIETNAM VIETNAM VIETNAM| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2019-08-10| date = 1980-03-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1980/03/02/archives/the-plight-of-the-children-abandoned-in-vietnam-vietnam-vietnam.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Kurtis joined [[Diane Sawyer]] on ''[[The Early Show#The CBS Morning News|The CBS Morning News]]'', the network broadcast from [[New York City]].

He also anchored three ''[[CBS Reports]]'': ''The Plane That Fell from the Sky'', ''The Golden Leaf'', and ''The Gift of Life''.\n\nHe returned to WBBM-TV in 1985.  In 1986, Kurtis hosted a four-part science series on [[PBS]] called ''[[The Miracle Planet]]'' as well as a four-part series in 1987 on the [[CIA]].  He formed his own documentary production company, [[Kurtis Productions]], in 1988, the same year he produced \"[[Return to Chernobyl]]\" for the PBS series ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]''. Kurtis narrated nearly 1,000 documentaries, and Kurtis Productions produced nearly 500 for series like ''[[The New Explorers]]'' on PBS; ''[[Investigative Reports]]'' and ''[[Cold Case Files]]'' for the [[A&E Television Network]]; and [[Investigating History]] for the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. He also hosted ''[[American Justice]]'', produced by [[Towers Productions]]. For [[CNBC]], the company has produced nearly 100 episodes of ''[[American Greed]]''.\n\nIn 1994, Kurtis obtained a videotape showing [[Richard Speck]], convicted of murdering eight student nurses in Chicago in 1966, having jailhouse sex and using drugs within the maximum security facility known as [[Stateville]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]].  He aired a report on WBBM-TV, Chicago, and produced a documentary for A&E Network that shocked the nation.  It resulted in the most sweeping changes to the Illinois penal system in its history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}{{dubious|date=July 2013}}\n\nKurtis has received two [[Peabody Award]]s, numerous [[Emmy Award]]s, awards from the [[Overseas Press Club]], and a duPont and has been inducted into the Illinois and Kansas Halls of Fame. In 1998, he was awarded the University of Kansas William Allen White citation.\n\nHe is the narrator of a multimedia book by Joe Garner, ''We Interrupt This Broadcast'', with a foreword by Walter Cronkite and epilogue by Brian Williams. Kurtis has authored three books, ''On Assignment'' (1984), ''Death Penalty on Trial'' (2004), and ''Prairie Table Cookbook'' (2008).\n\nSince June 2015, just as the Decades network officially launched, Kurtis serves as the lead host of ''[[Through the Decades]]'', a daily news magazine that covers historical events from that particular day since the advent of television.  Kurtis' co-hosts are reporters Kerry Sayers and Ellee Pai Hong.\n\n===Film work===\nKurtis narrated the 2010 documentary film ''[[Carbon Nation]]'' by [[Peter Byck]] and was the narrator in the 2004 film starring [[Will Ferrell]], ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' (2013).\n\nOn July 8, 2013, Kurtis was named the [[Voice of Illinois Tourism]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Kurtis new voice of Illinois tourism|url=http://www.sj-r.com/article/20130709/NEWS/307099908|work=The State Journal-Register|date=July 9, 2013|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tallgrass Beef Company===\nIn 2005, Kurtis founded [[Tallgrass Beef Company]], which raises and distributes grass-fed, hormone-free [[organic beef]]. Some of the beef sold comes from cattle raised on Kurtis's ranch in [[Sedan, Kansas]].\n\n===Other===\nKurtis and his sister, Jean Schodorf, inherited the historic site of the [[Little House on the Prairie]] as designated by the State of [[Kansas]]. It is now a not-for-profit museum with their grandmother's one-room schoolhouse, a tiny post office from [[Wayside, Kansas]], a homesteader's farmhouse, and attendant farm buildings.  Kurtis's father was a cousin of [[Frank Kurtis]] in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Hall of Fame.\n\nA 1972 report by Bill Kurtis while a correspondent for CBS News, Los Angeles, was used as the introduction to Dr. Dre's album, ''[[Compton (album)|Compton]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn several occasions starting in 2009, Kurtis appeared on [[NPR]]'s news quiz show ''[[Wait Wait...

Kurtis also contributed a spoken-word introduction to [[The Dandy Warhols]]' 2005 album ''[[Odditorium or Warlords of Mars]]''.

His reporting, along with [[Ron Yates]] of the [[Chicago Tribune]], helped persuade President [[Gerald Ford]] to pardon her in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} His legal education came into play when he covered the [[Chicago Seven]] conspiracy trial in 1969, which led to a job with [[CBS News]] in [[Los Angeles]] as correspondent.  One of his first assignments was covering the [[Charles Manson]] murder trial for 10&nbsp;months. He also covered the murder trials of [[Angela Davis]] and [[Juan Corona]] and the [[Pentagon Papers]] trial of [[Daniel Ellsberg]].\n\nIn 1973, Kurtis returned to Chicago to co-anchor with [[Walter Jacobson]] at WBBM-TV.  In 1978, his investigative focus unit broke the [[Agent Orange]] story, U.S. veterans who were sprayed by the defoliant in [[Vietnam]].  After a dramatic screening of the documentary in Washington, D.C., the Veterans Administration issued guidelines to diagnose and compensate those veterans affected by Agent Orange.  Kurtis returned to Vietnam in 1980 to cover the Vietnamese side of the story and, while there, discovered some 15,000 Vietnamese children conceived and left behind by Americans when the U.S. left in 1975. A story Kurtis wrote for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' was instrumental in obtaining special status for the children to enter the [[United States]], where they live today.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Kurtis| first = Bill| title = The Plight of the Children ABANDONED IN VIETNAM; VIETNAM VIETNAM VIETNAM| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2019-08-10| date = 1980-03-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1980/03/02/archives/the-plight-of-the-children-abandoned-in-vietnam-vietnam-vietnam.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Kurtis joined [[Diane Sawyer]] on ''[[The Early Show#The CBS Morning News|The CBS Morning News]]'', the network broadcast from [[New York City]].

He also anchored three ''[[CBS Reports]]'': ''The Plane That Fell from the Sky'', ''The Golden Leaf'', and ''The Gift of Life''.\n\nHe returned to WBBM-TV in 1985.  In 1986, Kurtis hosted a four-part science series on [[PBS]] called ''[[The Miracle Planet]]'' as well as a four-part series in 1987 on the [[CIA]].  He formed his own documentary production company, [[Kurtis Productions]], in 1988, the same year he produced \"[[Return to Chernobyl]]\" for the PBS series ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]''. Kurtis narrated nearly 1,000 documentaries, and Kurtis Productions produced nearly 500 for series like ''[[The New Explorers]]'' on PBS; ''[[Investigative Reports]]'' and ''[[Cold Case Files]]'' for the [[A&E Television Network]]; and [[Investigating History]] for the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. He also hosted ''[[American Justice]]'', produced by [[Towers Productions]]. For [[CNBC]], the company has produced nearly 100 episodes of ''[[American Greed]]''.\n\nIn 1994, Kurtis obtained a videotape showing [[Richard Speck]], convicted of murdering eight student nurses in Chicago in 1966, having jailhouse sex and using drugs within the maximum security facility known as [[Stateville]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]].  He aired a report on WBBM-TV, Chicago, and produced a documentary for A&E Network that shocked the nation.  It resulted in the most sweeping changes to the Illinois penal system in its history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}{{dubious|date=July 2013}}\n\nKurtis has received two [[Peabody Award]]s, numerous [[Emmy Award]]s, awards from the [[Overseas Press Club]], and a duPont and has been inducted into the Illinois and Kansas Halls of Fame. In 1998, he was awarded the University of Kansas William Allen White citation.\n\nHe is the narrator of a multimedia book by Joe Garner, ''We Interrupt This Broadcast'', with a foreword by Walter Cronkite and epilogue by Brian Williams. Kurtis has authored three books, ''On Assignment'' (1984), ''Death Penalty on Trial'' (2004), and ''Prairie Table Cookbook'' (2008).\n\nSince June 2015, just as the Decades network officially launched, Kurtis serves as the lead host of ''[[Through the Decades]]'', a daily news magazine that covers historical events from that particular day since the advent of television.  Kurtis' co-hosts are reporters Kerry Sayers and Ellee Pai Hong.\n\n===Film work===\nKurtis narrated the 2010 documentary film ''[[Carbon Nation]]'' by [[Peter Byck]] and was the narrator in the 2004 film starring [[Will Ferrell]], ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' (2013).\n\nOn July 8, 2013, Kurtis was named the [[Voice of Illinois Tourism]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Kurtis new voice of Illinois tourism|url=http://www.sj-r.com/article/20130709/NEWS/307099908|work=The State Journal-Register|date=July 9, 2013|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tallgrass Beef Company===\nIn 2005, Kurtis founded [[Tallgrass Beef Company]], which raises and distributes grass-fed, hormone-free [[organic beef]].

It is now a not-for-profit museum with their grandmother's one-room schoolhouse, a tiny post office from [[Wayside, Kansas]], a homesteader's farmhouse, and attendant farm buildings.  Kurtis's father was a cousin of [[Frank Kurtis]] in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Hall of Fame.\n\nA 1972 report by Bill Kurtis while a correspondent for CBS News, Los Angeles, was used as the introduction to Dr. Dre's album, ''[[Compton]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn several occasions starting in 2009, Kurtis appeared on [[NPR]]'s news quiz show ''[[Wait Wait...

[[Universal Music Group|Universal]] decided to produce a CD with 11 remixes produced by French and international famous [[DJ]]s and remixers. The album was officially announced in July 2003, to be entirely composed of original remixes, an idea not entirely appreciated by all Farmer's fans: some thought that the old hits should not be remixed, while others found that the idea of remixing Farmer's successes by the most famous DJs was brilliant.<ref name=\"Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Beno\u00eet Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 241-242\">''Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Myl\u00e8ne Farmer'', Beno\u00eet Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 241-242</ref>\n\nIn fact, this album is not really a [[Compilation album|compilation]], as although the original versions were already released as singles the remixes were, in general, then unknown to the public. The artistic direction of this album was given to Paul Van Parys, Jerome Devoise and Henry Neu. It was produced at Studios Guillaume Tell, which had already been used for the remix of \"[[C'est une belle journ\u00e9e]]\", by Devil Head. Farmer asked her sister, Brigitte Gautier, to design the cover, which she produced using a photo from a 2001 book about Farmer, recolouring it to fit the theme.<ref name=\"Jukebox\">\"Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, l'ic\u00f4ne\", ''Jukebox'', n\u00b0253, p. 7 [http://www.devant-soi.com/Monde-de-Myl%E8ne/presse/articles-presse/2008/02-2008-JUKEBOX-N253-2.jpg Devant-soi.com]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Retrieved 13 May 2008)</ref> While the whole was produced by [[Polydor]], the [[record label]]s Stuffed Monkey and Requiem Publishing didn't participate in this album.\n\nThe very first run of this album was slightly high, with just 200,000 copies.

The album was officially announced in July 2003, to be entirely composed of original remixes, an idea not entirely appreciated by all Farmer's fans: some thought that the old hits should not be remixed, while others found that the idea of remixing Farmer's successes by the most famous DJs was brilliant.<ref name=\"Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Beno\u00eet Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 241-242\">''Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Myl\u00e8ne Farmer'', Beno\u00eet Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 241-242</ref>\n\nIn fact, this album is not really a [[Compilation album|compilation]], as although the original versions were already released as singles the remixes were, in general, then unknown to the public. The artistic direction of this album was given to Paul Van Parys, Jerome Devoise and Henry Neu. It was produced at Studios Guillaume Tell, which had already been used for the remix of \"[[C'est une belle journ\u00e9e]]\", by Devil Head. Farmer asked her sister, Brigitte Gautier, to design the cover, which she produced using a photo from a 2001 book about Farmer, recolouring it to fit the theme.<ref name=\"Jukebox\">\"Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, l'ic\u00f4ne\", ''Jukebox'', n\u00b0253, p. 7 [http://www.devant-soi.com/Monde-de-Myl%E8ne/presse/articles-presse/2008/02-2008-JUKEBOX-N253-2.jpg Devant-soi.com]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Retrieved 13 May 2008)</ref> While the whole was produced by [[Polydor]], the [[record label]]s Stuffed Monkey and Requiem Publishing didn't participate in this album.\n\nThe very first run of this album was slightly high, with just 200,000 copies.

{"title_page": "R4200", "text_new": "{{Inline improve|date=January 2015}}\nThe '''R4200''' is a [[microprocessor]] designed by [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS Technologies, Inc.]] (MTI) that implemented the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS III]] [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA). It was also known as the VRX during development. The microprocessor was licensed to [[NEC]], and the company fabricated and marketed it as the VR4200. The first VR4200, an 80&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] part, was introduced in 1993. A faster 100&nbsp;MHz part became available in 1994. The R4200 was developed specifically for low-power [[Windows NT]] computers such as personal computers and laptops. MTI claimed the microprocessor's integer performance was greater than that of a high-end Intel [[Intel 80486|i486]] and 80% of a P5-variant [[P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] microprocessor. The R4200 ultimately did not see any use in personal computers and was repositioned as an embedded microprocessor that competed with the [[R4600]]. The R4300i variant was used in the widely popular [[Nintendo 64]] [[video game console]].\n\n==Description==\nThe R4200 is a [[Scalar processor|scalar]] design with a five-stage [[classic RISC pipeline]]. A notable feature is the use of the integer [[datapath]] for performing arithmetic operations on the [[Significand|mantissa]] portion of a [[floating point]] number. A separate datapath was used for the exponent. This scheme reduced cost by reducing the number of [[Transistor|transistors]], the size of the chip, and power consumption. It also impacted [[floating point]] performance negatively, but the R4200's intended applications did not require high floating point performance.\n\nThe R4200 has a 16&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] instruction [[CPU cache|cache]] and an 8&nbsp;KB data cache. Both caches are [[CPU cache#Associativity|direct-mapped]]. The instruction cache has a 32-byte line size, whereas the data cache has 16-byte line size. The data cache uses the [[write-back]] write protocol.\n\nThe R4200 has a 32-entry [[translation lookaside buffer]] (TLB) for data, and a 4-entry TLB for instructions. A 33-bit [[physical address]] is supported. The [[system bus]] is 64 bits wide and operates at half the internal clock frequency.\n\nThe R4200 contained 1.3 million transistors and had an area of 81&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>. NEC fabricated the R4200 in a [[600 nanometer|600 nm]] [[CMOS]] process with three levels of interconnect. It was packaged in a 179-pin [[ceramic pin grid array]] that was compatible with the [[R4000|R4x00PC]] and [[R4600]], or a 208-pin [[PQFP|plastic quad flat pack]] (PQFP). It used a 3.3&nbsp;V power supply, dissipating 1.8&nbsp;W typically and a maximum of 2&nbsp;W at 80&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==R4300i==\nThe R4300i is a derivative of the R4200 designed by MTI for embedded applications announced on 17 April 1995.<ref name=\"MTI1995\"/> It differs from the R4200 by featuring an improved integer multiplier with a lower latency and a cut-down 32-bit system bus for reduced cost. The chip had an area of 45&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> and was fabricated in a [[350 nanometer|350 nm]] process. It was packaged in a 120-pin PQFP. It uses a 3.3&nbsp;V power supply and dissipates 1.8&nbsp;W at 100&nbsp;MHz and 2.2&nbsp;W at 133&nbsp;MHz. \n\nThe R4300i was licensed to NEC and [[Toshiba]], and was marketed by those companies as the VR4300 or TX4300, respectively. Both companies offered 100 and 133&nbsp;MHz versions. A derivative of the VR4300 was developed by NEC for the [[Nintendo 64 technical specifications|Nintendo 64]] game console, clocked at 93.75&nbsp;MHz and labeled NUS-CPU. Although development boards for the Nintendo 64 used stock NEC VR4300 CPUs, the final CPU has been found to be not pin-compatible.

It was manufactured in a [[250 nanometer|250 nm]] process and packaged in a 120-pin PQFP.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist | refs=\n<ref name=\"MTI1995\">{{cite press release | publisher=MIPS Technologies, Inc. | date=17 April 1995 | title=MIPS/NEC Announce New Consumer-market RISC Processor}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"NEC1998\">{{cite press release | publisher=NEC Corporation | date=20 January 1998 | title=NEC Offers Two High Cost Performance 64-bit RISC Microprocessors}}</ref>\n}}\n* \"MIPS, NEC will launch 64-bit device\".
