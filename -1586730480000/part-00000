Their ranks consisted of both [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] people, and they raided the entire [[Border country]] without regard to their victims' nationality. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the [[House of Stuart]] in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[House of Tudor]] in the [[Kingdom of England]]\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Dryhope Tower - geograph.org.uk - 195093.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Dryhope Tower]] built in the 1500s for protection against the reivers]]\nScotland and England were frequently at war during the late [[Middle Ages]]. During these wars, the livelihood of the people on the Borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not formally at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in either or both kingdoms was often weak, particularly in remote locations. The difficulty and uncertainties of basic human survival meant that communities and/or people kindred to each other would seek security through group strength and cunning. They would attempt to improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense, enemies who were frequently also just trying to survive. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for [[Raid (military)|depredations]] rather than conferring any security.\n\nThere were other factors which promoted a [[Predation|predatory]] mode of living in the Borders. A system of inheritance called [[gavelkind]] meant that estates, and particularly land, were divided equally between all sons on a man's death; although this was considered more fair than [[primogeniture]], it also meant that many people owned insufficient land to survive.<ref name=Durham5>Durham & McBride, p.5</ref> Also, much of the border region is mountainous or open moorland, unsuitable for arable farming but good for grazing. Livestock was easily rustled and driven back to raiders' territory by mounted reivers who knew the country well. The raiders also often removed easily portable household goods or valuables, and took prisoners for ransom.\n\nThe attitudes of the English and Scottish governments towards the border families alternated from indulgence and even encouragement, as these fierce families served as the first line of defence against invasion across the border, to draconian and indiscriminate punishment when their lawlessness became intolerable to the authorities.\n\n''Reive'', a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) ''reifen.'' The verb ''reave'' meaning \"plunder, rob\", a closely related word, comes from the Middle English ''reven''. There also exists a [[Northumbrian English|Northumbrian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''reifen.''  All three derive from [[Old English]] ''r\u0113afian'' which means \"to rob, plunder, pillage\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Reiver merriam-webster.com]</ref> The corresponding verb in Dutch is \"(be)roven\", and \"(be)rauben\" in German.\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:WatHarden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Walter Scott of Harden|Auld Wat of Harden]]'' by [[Tom Scott (painter)|Tom Scott]]. A romanticised image of a notorious raider, Walter Scott of Harden.]]\nThe reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]], and Scottish raids were known as far south as [[Yorkshire]]. The largest of these was [[The Great Raid of 1322]], during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], where it reached as far south as [[Chorley]]. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.38</ref>\n\nWhen raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: [[Galloway pony]], [[Hobelar]]). The original dress of a [[Northumbrian tartan|shepherd's plaid]] was later replaced by light armour such as [[brigandine]]s or [[Jack of plate|jacks of plate]] (a type of sleeveless [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as [[burgonet]]s or [[Morion (helmet)|morions]]; hence their nickname of the \"steel bonnets\". They were armed with light lances and small shields, and sometimes also with [[longbow]]s, or light [[crossbow]]s, known as \"latches\", or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried [[sword]]s and [[dirk]]s.\n\n==Borderers as soldiers==\nBorder reivers were sometimes in demand as [[mercenaries|mercenary soldiers]], owing to their recognized skills as light [[cavalry]].  Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the [[Low Countries]] and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] and [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]]. After meeting one reiver (the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|''Bold Buccleugh'']]), [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is quoted as having said that \"with ten thousand such men, [[James VI and I|James VI]] could shake any throne in Europe.\" \n\nThese borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly-behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as [[Battle of Ancrum Moor|Ancrum Moor]] in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in 1547, an observer ([[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]]) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.<ref>Moffat</ref>\n\n==Dwellings and fortifications==\n[[File:Black Middens Bastle - geograph.org.uk - 1224658.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black Middens Bastle House]], a surviving bastle house near [[Kielder Water]] in Northumberland]]\n\nThe inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]]s.\n\nIn the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The [[bastle house]] was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.24</ref> Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.\n\n[[Peel tower]]s (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. [[Smailholm Tower]] is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.23</ref>\n\nPeel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.\n\n==Law and order==\n[[File:Late-medieval jack, National Museum of Scotland collection.jpg|thumb|A leather jack of the kind worn by reivers in the 16th century]]\nDuring periods of nominal peace, a special body of [[customary law]], known as [[March law (Anglo-Scottish border)|March law]] or Border law, grew up to deal with the situation. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This \"hot trod\" had to proceed with \"hound and horne, hew and cry\",<ref>Durham & McBride, p. 20.</ref> making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a [[sleuth hound]] (also known as a \"slew dogge\") to follow raiders' tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least).<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The \"cold trod\" mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of \"following the trod\".<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p. 215 fn.</ref>\n\nBoth sides of the border were divided into [[Scottish Marches|Marches]], each under a [[Lord Warden of the Marches|march warden]]. The march wardens' various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. On occasion, march wardens could make ''warden roades'' to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials.\n\nThe march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms' march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as \"Days of Truce\", were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days.\n\nMarch wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as [[Sir John Forster]], who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp.139\u2013140</ref>\n\nBy the death of [[Elizabeth I of England]], things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.210</ref> When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as \"Ill Week\", resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.360</ref> Upon his accession to the English throne, [[James I of England|James VI]] of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term \"Borders\" in favour of \"Middle [[Shire]]s,\" and dealing out stern justice to reivers.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent [[Union of the Crowns]] was enacted; it was [[long title]]d ''An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come''. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n226/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.195</ref> Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1 c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled ''An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.''

Under section two of the act, the [[benefit of clergy]] was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.&nbsp;581</ref>\n\nGenerally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent \"theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\", these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years.

Its holder, the Keeper of Liddesdale, usually had equal status to the Scottish Wardens of the Marches.]]\nThe Border families can be referred to as clans, as the [[Scot]]s themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] of 1587 there is the description of the \"Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris\" \u2013 thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said \"By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan\". Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the [[MacDonald]] family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOther terms were also used to describe the Border families, such as the \"Riding Surnames\" and the \"Graynes\" thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their [[Sept (social)|sept]]s. e.g. [[Clan Donald]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Sleat]], can be compared with the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Scotts of Buccleuch]] and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, and had territories in which most of their kindred lived. Border families did practice customs similar to those of the [[Gaels]], such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of [[manrent]]. Although feudalism existed, loyalty to kin was much more important and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===Marches===\n\nIn 1587 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a statute: \"For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.\"<ref>Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466\u2013467 (1587)</ref> Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands.

It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.\n\nRiders did not wear identifying [[tartan]]s. The tradition of family tartans dates from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era and was inspired by the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The typical dress of reivers included [[trews]], [[Jack of plate]], steel bonnets ([[helmet]]s), and [[riding boot]]s.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossing the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels.jpg|thumb|310px|left|Skills of horsemanship are kept alive in the Borders: fording the [[River Tweed]] on Braw Lad's Day, [[Galashiels]] 2011]]\n[[File:Galashiels Reiver Statue 02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Reiver statue at Galashiels]]\nLong after they were gone, the reivers were romanticised by writers such as [[Sir Walter Scott]] (''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''), although he made mistakes; the term [[Moss-trooper]], which he used, refers to one of the robbers that existed after the real Reivers had been put down. Nevertheless, Scott was a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad. The stories of legendary border reivers like [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the \"Dish of Spurs\" which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to acquire more plunder. Scottish author [[Nigel Tranter]] revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels.  Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869\u20131963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including ''The reiver's heart'' (1903), ''The raiders'' (1904), ''Whaup o' the rede: a ballad of the border raiders'' (1909), ''[[Kirkhope Tower]]'' (1913), and ''Ho! for the blades of Harden''.\n\nThe names of the [[Reiver]] families are still very much apparent amongst the inhabitants of the [[Scottish Borders]], Northumberland and [[Cumbria]] today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as 'annual re-runs of the bloody [[Battle of Otterburn]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.\n\n[[Hawick]] in Scotland holds an annual Reivers' festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of [[Duns]] is headed by the \"Reiver\" and \"Reiver's Lass\", a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency's first two leaflets from the 'Scots Legacy' series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.\n\nBorderers (particularly those banished by [[James VI of Scotland]]) took part in the [[plantation of Ulster]] becoming the people known as [[Ulster-Scots]] ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster with names such as Elliot, Armstrong, Beattie, Bell, Carruthers, Hume and Heron, Rutledge, and Turnbulls amongst others.\n\nBorder surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of [[Scots-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] settlement in the United States, and particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the [[Upland South]]. Author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, [[Neil Armstrong]], was the first person to set foot on the moon. In 1972 Armstrong was made a [[Freedom of the city|freeman]] of the town of [[Langholm]] in Scotland, the home of his ancestors.\n\nThe artist [[Gordon Young (artist)|Gordon Young]] created a public art work in Carlisle: ''Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement'', a nod to [[Gavin Dunbar (archbishop of Glasgow)|Gavin Dunbar]], the Archbishop of Glasgow's 1525 ''Monition of Cursing''.  Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects [[Tullie House Museum]] to [[Carlisle Castle]] under a main road, and part of the bishop's curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|title=Cursing Stone & Reiver Pavement / Carlisle, 2001|publisher=Gordon Young|accessdate=23 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227133140/http://gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Debatable Lands]]\n* [[History of Northumberland]]\n* ''[[The Borderers]]'' (Television series)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Carey|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth|title=The Stirring World of Robert Carey, Robert Carey's Memoirs 1577\u20131625|publisher=RippingYarns.com|isbn=1-904466-29-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Durham|first=Keith|author2=McBride, Angus|title=The Border Reivers: The story of the Anglo-Scottish borderlands|year=1995|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-85532-417-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781855324176}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Garth|title=War Stories: Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-4012-1039-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York}}\n* {{cite book|last=Howker|first=Janni|authorlink=Janni Howker|title=Martin Farrell|year=1997|publisher=Red Fox|isbn=978-0-09-918161-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=MacDonald Fraser|first=George|authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser|title=The Steel Bonnets|year=1971|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-272746-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Reivers|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-674-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Rob|title=The Border Reivers: A stain on the image of Tudor England|publisher=[[Medieval History Magazine]]|volume=4|date=December 2003}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moss|first=Tom|title=Deadlock and Deliverance: The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong|year=2007|publisher=Rose Cottage Publications|isbn=978-0-9558016-0-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tait|first=Jon|title=Dick the Devil's Bairns: Breaking the Border Mafia|year=2018|publisher=Tredition|isbn=978-3-7482-2361-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.borderreivers.co.uk The Border Reivers Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090126155155/http://nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm The Border Reivers]\n* [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/ Border Reivers DNA Project]\n* [http://the-border-reivers.co.uk Yet Another Border Reivers Website]\n* [http://www.everymansprey.com The Routledge Reivers]\n* [http://www.reivershistory.co.uk The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074111/http://www.go-britain.com/html/borders_map.htm#borders Borders Map with surnames]\n\n{{Scottish clans}}\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Scottish border]]\n[[Category:History of Europe]]\n[[Category:Border Reivers| ]]\n[[Category:Cavalry]]\n[[Category:History of Cumberland]]\n[[Category:History of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:History of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Military history of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:History of the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Tudor England]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{redirect|Reivers|the actor|David Reivers|articles with similar names|The Reivers (disambiguation)}}\n{{engvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Reivers raid on Gilnockie Tower.jpg|thumb|Reivers at [[Gilnockie Tower]], from a 19th-century print|alt=|366x366px]]\n[[File:Wat o' Harden's horn.JPG|thumb|273x273px|Notorious raider, [[Walter Scott of Harden]]'s horn, noted in a poem called the \"The Reiver's Wedding\" by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]:\n\n\n\"He took a bugle frae his side,\n\nWith names carved o'er and o'er,\n\nFull many a chief of meikle pride,\n\nThat Border bugle bore.\"\n\n\n(A fragment of the full poem.)]]\n'''Border reivers''' were [[Cattle raiding|raiders]] along the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] from the late 13th century to the beginning of the 17th century. Their ranks consisted of both [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] people, and they raided the entire [[Border country]] without regard to their victims' nationality. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the [[House of Stuart]] in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[House of Tudor]] in the [[Kingdom of England]]\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Dryhope Tower - geograph.org.uk - 195093.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Dryhope Tower]] built in the 1500s for protection against the reivers]]\nScotland and England were frequently at war during the late [[Middle Ages]]. During these wars, the livelihood of the people on the Borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not formally at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in either or both kingdoms was often weak, particularly in remote locations. The difficulty and uncertainties of basic human survival meant that communities and/or people kindred to each other would seek security through group strength and cunning. They would attempt to improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense, enemies who were frequently also just trying to survive. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for [[Raid (military)|depredations]] rather than conferring any security.\n\nThere were other factors which promoted a [[Predation|predatory]] mode of living in the Borders. A system of inheritance called [[gavelkind]] meant that estates, and particularly land, were divided equally between all sons on a man's death; although this was considered more fair than [[primogeniture]], it also meant that many people owned insufficient land to survive.<ref name=Durham5>Durham & McBride, p.5</ref> Also, much of the border region is mountainous or open moorland, unsuitable for arable farming but good for grazing. Livestock was easily rustled and driven back to raiders' territory by mounted reivers who knew the country well. The raiders also often removed easily portable household goods or valuables, and took prisoners for ransom.\n\nThe attitudes of the English and Scottish governments towards the border families alternated from indulgence and even encouragement, as these fierce families served as the first line of defence against invasion across the border, to draconian and indiscriminate punishment when their lawlessness became intolerable to the authorities.\n\n''Reive'', a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) ''reifen.'' The verb ''reave'' meaning \"plunder, rob\", a closely related word, comes from the Middle English ''reven''. There also exists a [[Northumbrian English|Northumbrian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''reifen.''  All three derive from [[Old English]] ''r\u0113afian'' which means \"to rob, plunder, pillage\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Reiver merriam-webster.com]</ref> The corresponding verb in Dutch is \"(be)roven\", and \"(be)rauben\" in German.\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:WatHarden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Walter Scott of Harden|Auld Wat of Harden]]'' by [[Tom Scott (painter)|Tom Scott]]. A romanticised image of a notorious raider, Walter Scott of Harden.]]\nThe reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]], and Scottish raids were known as far south as [[Yorkshire]]. The largest of these was [[The Great Raid of 1322]], during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], where it reached as far south as [[Chorley]]. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.38</ref>\n\nWhen raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: [[Galloway pony]], [[Hobelar]]). The original dress of a [[Northumbrian tartan|shepherd's plaid]] was later replaced by light armour such as [[brigandine]]s or [[Jack of plate|jacks of plate]] (a type of sleeveless [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as [[burgonet]]s or [[Morion (helmet)|morions]]; hence their nickname of the \"steel bonnets\". They were armed with light lances and small shields, and sometimes also with [[longbow]]s, or light [[crossbow]]s, known as \"latches\", or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried [[sword]]s and [[dirk]]s.\n\n==Borderers as soldiers==\nBorder reivers were sometimes in demand as [[mercenaries|mercenary soldiers]], owing to their recognized skills as light [[cavalry]].  Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the [[Low Countries]] and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] and [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]]. After meeting one reiver (the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|''Bold Buccleugh'']]), [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is quoted as having said that \"with ten thousand such men, [[James VI and I|James VI]] could shake any throne in Europe.\" \n\nThese borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly-behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as [[Battle of Ancrum Moor|Ancrum Moor]] in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in 1547, an observer ([[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]]) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.<ref>Moffat</ref>\n\n==Dwellings and fortifications==\n[[File:Black Middens Bastle - geograph.org.uk - 1224658.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black Middens Bastle House]], a surviving bastle house near [[Kielder Water]] in Northumberland]]\n\nThe inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]]s.\n\nIn the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The [[bastle house]] was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.24</ref> Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.\n\n[[Peel tower]]s (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. [[Smailholm Tower]] is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.23</ref>\n\nPeel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.\n\n==Law and order==\n[[File:Late-medieval jack, National Museum of Scotland collection.jpg|thumb|A leather jack of the kind worn by reivers in the 16th century]]\nDuring periods of nominal peace, a special body of [[customary law]], known as [[March law (Anglo-Scottish border)|March law]] or Border law, grew up to deal with the situation. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This \"hot trod\" had to proceed with \"hound and horne, hew and cry\",<ref>Durham & McBride, p. 20.</ref> making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a [[sleuth hound]] (also known as a \"slew dogge\") to follow raiders' tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least).<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The \"cold trod\" mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of \"following the trod\".<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p. 215 fn.</ref>\n\nBoth sides of the border were divided into [[Scottish Marches|Marches]], each under a [[Lord Warden of the Marches|march warden]]. The march wardens' various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. On occasion, march wardens could make ''warden roades'' to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials.\n\nThe march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms' march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as \"Days of Truce\", were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days.\n\nMarch wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as [[Sir John Forster]], who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp.139\u2013140</ref>\n\nBy the death of [[Elizabeth I of England]], things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.210</ref> When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as \"Ill Week\", resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.360</ref> Upon his accession to the English throne, [[James I of England|James VI]] of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term \"Borders\" in favour of \"Middle [[Shire]]s,\" and dealing out stern justice to reivers.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent [[Union of the Crowns]] was enacted; it was [[long title]]d ''An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come''. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n226/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.195</ref> Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1 c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled ''An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.'' To deal with cross-border flight, the act allowed the trial of an Englishman in Scotland if the felony was committed there, and he was later arrested in England; it became effective after a similar act had been passed in Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n248/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.216]</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and long-running lawlessness by [[Moss-trooper|Moss troopers]] nearly six decades later, parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1662 (13 & 14 Cha. 2. c. 22) for the border area; it was [[long title]]d ''An Act for preventing of Theft and Rapine upon the Northern Borders of England.'' Section seven of the act revives both previous acts passed under James I.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp417-418 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.417</ref> With the 1662 act about to expire, the sixth session of [[Cavalier Parliament]] passed the Moss Troopers Act 1666 (18 Cha. 2 c. 3), long titled ''An Act to continue a former Act for preventing of Thefte and Rapine upon the Northerne Borders of England.'' Under section two of the act, the [[benefit of clergy]] was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.&nbsp;581</ref>\n\nGenerally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent \"theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\", these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years.

Its holder, the Keeper of Liddesdale, usually had equal status to the Scottish Wardens of the Marches.]]\nThe Border families can be referred to as clans, as the [[Scot]]s themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] of 1587 there is the description of the \"Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris\" \u2013 thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said \"By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan\". Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the [[MacDonald]] family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOther terms were also used to describe the Border families, such as the \"Riding Surnames\" and the \"Graynes\" thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their [[Sept (social)|sept]]s. e.g. [[Clan Donald]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Sleat]], can be compared with the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Scotts of Buccleuch]] and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, and had territories in which most of their kindred lived. Border families did practice customs similar to those of the [[Gaels]], such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of [[manrent]]. Although feudalism existed, loyalty to kin was much more important and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===Marches===\n\nIn 1587 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a statute: \"For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.\"<ref>Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466\u2013467 (1587)</ref> Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands. The Borders portion listed 17 'clannis' with a Chief and their associated Marches:\n[[File:Marches_map.JPG|right|thumb|Regions of the Scottish marches]]\n'''''Middle March'''''\n*[[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], Nixon, Crozier\n'''''West March'''''\n*Scott, Bates, Little, [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]], Glendenning, Irvine, Bell, [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], [[Graham (surname)|Graham]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], Jardine, Moffat and Latimer.\n\nOf the Border Clans or Graynes listed on this roll, [[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], [[Clan Scott|Scott]], [[Clan Irvine|Irvine]], [[Clan Graham|Graham]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Clan Jardine|Jardine]] and [[Clan Moffat|Moffat]] are registered with the Court of Lord Lyon in Edinburgh as Scottish Clans (with a Chief), others such as [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], [[Clan Little|Little]] and Bell are [[armigerous]] clans with no Chief, while such as [[Clan Blackadder]], also an [[armigerous]] clan in the Middle Ages, later died out or lost their lands, and are unregistered with the Lyon Court.\n\nThe historic riding surnames recorded by George MacDonald Fraser in ''The Steel Bonnets'' (1989)<ref>George McDonald Fraser, pp.&nbsp;56\u201365</ref> are:\n\n'''''East March'''''\n* Scotland: [[Clan Home|Hume]], [[Clan Trotter|Trotter]], [[Dixon Baronets|Dixon]], [[Bromfield (surname)|Bromfield]], [[Craw (surname)|Craw]], [[Clan Cranstoun|Cranston]].\n* England: [[Forster (surname)|Forster]], [[Selby family|Selby]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], [[Dunn (surname)|Dunn]].\n'''''Middle March'''''\n* Scotland: Burns, [[Clan Kerr|Kerr]], [[Clan Young|Young]], [[Clan Pringle|Pringle]], Davison, Gilchrist, [[Tait (surname)|Tait]] of East Teviotdale.

It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.\n\nRiders did not wear identifying [[tartan]]s. The tradition of family tartans dates from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era and was inspired by the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The typical dress of reivers included [[trews]], [[Jack of plate]], steel bonnets ([[helmet]]s), and [[riding boot]]s.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossing the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels.jpg|thumb|310px|left|Skills of horsemanship are kept alive in the Borders: fording the [[River Tweed]] on Braw Lad's Day, [[Galashiels]] 2011]]\n[[File:Galashiels Reiver Statue 02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Reiver statue at Galashiels]]\nLong after they were gone, the reivers were romanticised by writers such as [[Sir Walter Scott]] (''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''), although he made mistakes; the term [[Moss-trooper]], which he used, refers to one of the robbers that existed after the real Reivers had been put down. Nevertheless, Scott was a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad. The stories of legendary border reivers like [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the \"Dish of Spurs\" which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to acquire more plunder. Scottish author [[Nigel Tranter]] revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels.  Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869\u20131963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including ''The reiver's heart'' (1903), ''The raiders'' (1904), ''Whaup o' the rede: a ballad of the border raiders'' (1909), ''[[Kirkhope Tower]]'' (1913), and ''Ho! for the blades of Harden''.\n\nThe names of the [[Reiver]] families are still very much apparent amongst the inhabitants of the [[Scottish Borders]], Northumberland and [[Cumbria]] today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as 'annual re-runs of the bloody [[Battle of Otterburn]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.\n\n[[Hawick]] in Scotland holds an annual Reivers' festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of [[Duns]] is headed by the \"Reiver\" and \"Reiver's Lass\", a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency's first two leaflets from the 'Scots Legacy' series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.\n\nBorderers (particularly those banished by [[James VI of Scotland]]) took part in the [[plantation of Ulster]] becoming the people known as [[Ulster-Scots]] ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster with names such as Elliot, Armstrong, Beattie, Bell, Carruthers, Hume and Heron, Rutledge, and Turnbulls amongst others.\n\nBorder surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of [[Scots-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] settlement in the United States, and particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the [[Upland South]]. Author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, [[Neil Armstrong]], was the first person to set foot on the moon. In 1972 Armstrong was made a [[Freedom of the city|freeman]] of the town of [[Langholm]] in Scotland, the home of his ancestors.\n\nThe artist [[Gordon Young (artist)|Gordon Young]] created a public art work in Carlisle: ''Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement'', a nod to [[Gavin Dunbar (archbishop of Glasgow)|Gavin Dunbar]], the Archbishop of Glasgow's 1525 ''Monition of Cursing''.  Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects [[Tullie House Museum]] to [[Carlisle Castle]] under a main road, and part of the bishop's curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|title=Cursing Stone & Reiver Pavement / Carlisle, 2001|publisher=Gordon Young|accessdate=23 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227133140/http://gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Debatable Lands]]\n* [[History of Northumberland]]\n* ''[[The Borderers]]'' (Television series)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Carey|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth|title=The Stirring World of Robert Carey, Robert Carey's Memoirs 1577\u20131625|publisher=RippingYarns.com|isbn=1-904466-29-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Durham|first=Keith|author2=McBride, Angus|title=The Border Reivers: The story of the Anglo-Scottish borderlands|year=1995|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-85532-417-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781855324176}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Garth|title=War Stories: Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-4012-1039-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York}}\n* {{cite book|last=Howker|first=Janni|authorlink=Janni Howker|title=Martin Farrell|year=1997|publisher=Red Fox|isbn=978-0-09-918161-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=MacDonald Fraser|first=George|authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser|title=The Steel Bonnets|year=1971|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-272746-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Reivers|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-674-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Rob|title=The Border Reivers: A stain on the image of Tudor England|publisher=[[Medieval History Magazine]]|volume=4|date=December 2003}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moss|first=Tom|title=Deadlock and Deliverance: The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong|year=2007|publisher=Rose Cottage Publications|isbn=978-0-9558016-0-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tait|first=Jon|title=Dick the Devil's Bairns: Breaking the Border Mafia|year=2018|publisher=Tredition|isbn=978-3-7482-2361-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.borderreivers.co.uk The Border Reivers Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090126155155/http://nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm The Border Reivers]\n* [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/ Border Reivers DNA Project]\n* [http://the-border-reivers.co.uk Yet Another Border Reivers Website]\n* [http://www.everymansprey.com The Routledge Reivers]\n* [http://www.reivershistory.co.uk The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074111/http://www.go-britain.com/html/borders_map.htm#borders Borders Map with surnames]\n\n{{Scottish clans}}\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Scottish border]]\n[[Category:History of Europe]]\n[[Category:Border Reivers| ]]\n[[Category:Cavalry]]\n[[Category:History of Cumberland]]\n[[Category:History of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:History of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Military history of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:History of the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Tudor England]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_reivers"}

The city is part of the [[Seattle metropolitan area]] and is located {{convert|16|mi|km}} north of [[Seattle]] and {{convert|13|mi|km}} south of [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], near the junction of [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] and [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|Interstate 405]]. It is the fourth-largest city in Snohomish County, with a population of 35,836 in the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. census]].\n\nLynnwood is a [[suburb]]an [[bedroom community]] for Seattle, Everett and [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]]. It has one of the largest concentrations of retailers in the region, anchored by the [[Alderwood Mall]] and businesses along major streets. The city also has a [[Edmonds Community College|community college]], a [[Lynnwood Convention Center|convention center]], and a major [[Lynnwood Transit Center|transit center]], located in the developing [[city center]].\n\nThe Lynnwood area was logged and settled by [[Homestead Acts|homesteaders]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the development of [[Alderwood Manor, Washington|Alderwood Manor]] as a planned farming community. Lynnwood, named for the wife of a realtor, emerged in the late 1940s around the intersection of [[Washington State Route 99|Highway 99]] and 196th Street Southwest. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] on April 23, 1959, and grew into a suburban hub in the years following the completion of Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Alderwood Mall opened in 1979 and spurred the transformation of eastern Lynnwood into a retail and office district.\n\n==History==\n\nPrior to contact with American settlers, the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]] tribe of Native Americans used the area of modern-day Lynnwood for summertime activities, including hunting, fishing, berry gathering, and root cultivation. The Snohomish were relocated to the [[Tulalip]] reservation, near modern-day [[Marysville, Washington|Marysville]], after the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, opening the area for American settlement.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Wilma |first=David |date=July 13, 2007 |title=Lynnwood \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/8200 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrown's Bay, part of [[Puget Sound]], and modern-day Meadowdale were surveyed by American loggers in 1859.<ref name=\"Meadowdale\">{{cite web |last=Villigan |first=Tiffany |date=September 23, 2014 |title=Meadowdale: \"One of the most prettily situated hamlets in Snohomish County.\" |url=http://www.alderwood.org/meadowdale-prettily-situated-hamlet-snohomish-county-pt1/ |publisher=Lynnwood-Alderwood Manor Heritage Association |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> Logging on Brown's Bay began in 1860, and the first American settlers arrived in the 1880s.

The [[Puget Mill Company]], then the largest landowner in southern Snohomish County, established the [[planned community]] of \"[[Alderwood Manor, Washington|Alderwood Manor]]\" in 1917 and marketed the area to urban dwellers wishing to build farms in the countryside.

The city is part of the [[Seattle metropolitan area]] and is located {{convert|16|mi|km}} north of [[Seattle]] and {{convert|13|mi|km}} south of [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], near the junction of [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] and [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|Interstate 405]]. It is the fourth-largest city in Snohomish County, with a population of 35,836 in the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. census]].\n\nLynnwood is a [[suburb]]an [[bedroom community]] for Seattle, Everett and [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]]. It has one of the largest concentrations of retailers in the region, anchored by the [[Alderwood Mall]] and businesses along major streets. The city also has a [[Edmonds Community College|community college]], a [[Lynnwood Convention Center|convention center]], and a major [[Lynnwood Transit Center|transit center]], located in the developing [[city center]].\n\nThe Lynnwood area was logged and settled by [[Homestead Acts|homesteaders]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the development of [[Alderwood Manor, Washington|Alderwood Manor]] as a planned farming community. Lynnwood, named for the wife of a realtor, emerged in the late 1940s around the intersection of [[Washington State Route 99|Highway 99]] and 196th Street Southwest. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] on April 23, 1959, and grew into a suburban hub in the years following the completion of Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Alderwood Mall opened in 1979 and spurred the transformation of eastern Lynnwood into a retail and office district.\n\n==History==\n\nPrior to contact with American settlers, the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]] tribe of Native Americans used the area of modern-day Lynnwood for summertime activities, including hunting, fishing, berry gathering, and root cultivation. The Snohomish were relocated to the [[Tulalip]] reservation, near modern-day [[Marysville, Washington|Marysville]], after the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, opening the area for American settlement.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Wilma |first=David |date=July 13, 2007 |title=Lynnwood \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/8200 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrown's Bay, part of [[Puget Sound]], and modern-day Meadowdale were surveyed by American loggers in 1859.<ref name=\"Meadowdale\">{{cite web |last=Villigan |first=Tiffany |date=September 23, 2014 |title=Meadowdale: \"One of the most prettily situated hamlets in Snohomish County.\" |url=http://www.alderwood.org/meadowdale-prettily-situated-hamlet-snohomish-county-pt1/ |publisher=Lynnwood-Alderwood Manor Heritage Association |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> Logging on Brown's Bay began in 1860, and the first American settlers arrived in the 1880s.

The arrival of the [[Seattle\u2013Everett Interurban Railway]] in 1910 brought reliable transportation to the area, as well as real estate speculators. The [[Puget Mill Company]], then the largest landowner in southern Snohomish County, established the [[planned community]] of \"[[Alderwood Manor, Washington|Alderwood Manor]]\" in 1917 and marketed the area to urban dwellers wishing to build farms in the countryside. Alderwood Manor, located near an Interurban station, gained streets named for tree species and was divided into {{convert|5 to 10|acre|adj=mid}} plots that sold for $200 per acre.

WWE first produced the event in 1985 and has since produced 36 editions, with the [[WrestleMania 36|most recent]] having been held in [[Orlando, Florida]] on March 25\u201326, 2020 ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] April 4\u20135). WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event, airs on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It contributes to the worldwide commercial success of WWE through media, merchandise, and shows. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner [[Vince McMahon]], while long time WWE ring announcer and [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Howard Finkel]] is credited with devising the name \"WrestleMania\" in 1984.\n\nWrestleMania's widespread success helped transform professional wrestling. The event has facilitated the rise to stardom of several top WWE wrestlers. Celebrities such as [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mr. T]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Lawrence Taylor]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Diddy\" Combs]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Fred Durst]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] have participated or made special appearances within the events.\n\nThe [[WrestleMania I|first WrestleMania]] was held in [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]; the 10th and 20th editions were also held there. [[WrestleMania III]] in the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Pontiac, Michigan]] was the highest-attended indoor sports event in the world, with 93,173 fans in attendance. The record stood until February 14, 2010, when the [[2010 NBA All-Star Game]] broke the indoor sporting event record with an attendance of 108,713 at Cowboys Stadium, since renamed [[AT&T Stadium]], in [[Arlington, Texas]].<ref name=\"AP recap\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300214032|title=East wins in front of biggest crowd to watch hoops game |publisher=ESPN|date=February 14, 2010|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> In 2016, WrestleMania 32 surpassed WrestleMania III as the highest-attended professional wrestling event ever held in America, with 101,763 fans in attendance at AT&T Stadium, although the company revealed that attendance figures are manipulated for marketing purposes through investor calls.

Other WWE championships are also contested for, while the [[Card (sports)|match card]] also includes gimmick matches and matches involving personal feuds.\n\nSince 1993, the winner of the annual [[Royal Rumble]] match has been able to receive a guaranteed WWE Championship match at the same year's WrestleMania. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship in 2002, the winner was also given the option to choose between the world title or the WWE championship. The creation of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in June 2006 gave the Rumble winner a third option: to choose to challenge for the [[ECW World Championship]]. This option was made available from 2007 until the brand was retired in 2010. However, this option was never chosen.<ref name=ecwtitle>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007/|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-05|date=2007-02-05}}</ref> The brand split ended in 2011 and the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships were unified in 2013, leaving the former as the only title to challenge for until the reintroduction of the brand split in 2016, which added the WWE Universal Championship as a choice. A women's Royal Rumble match was introduced in 2018, and the winner has the option of challenging for either the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] or [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]].\n\n[[WrestleMania 21]] saw the introduction of the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]]. This match features six to ten participants and took place at six WrestleManias between 2005 and 2010 before becoming the headline match of its own [[pay-per-view]] event, [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] which incorporated the use of two Money in the Bank ladder matches for both respective WWE brands, [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] and [[WWE Raw|Raw]]. The participant who retrieves the briefcase suspended above the ring wins a contract, which guarantees a world title match at the time and place of the winner's choosing for up to one year, including the following year's WrestleMania. This lasted until 2010 when the Money in the Bank pay per view was introduced and thus the Money in the Bank ladder match was retired from WrestleMania.<ref name=\"MITB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6464426/results/|accessdate=2008-05-23|title=Results:Money in the Bank ladder match| publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2008-03-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Forbes]] named WrestleMania one of the world's most valuable sports event brands from 2014 to 2017, ranking it sixth with a brand value of US$195 million in 2017 behind the [[Super Bowl]], [[Summer Olympics]], [[Winter Olympics]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Final Four]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/59e62ee431358e542c03d5be/6-wrestlemania/|title=Forbes Fab 40 2017|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=24 October 2017|date=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Commentators===\nFor five of the first six WrestleManias [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Jesse Ventura]] served as the color commentators (the exception being WrestleMania 2, which was split among three venues and had Monsoon, Ventura, and Vince McMahon split up with guest commentators), while [[Bobby Heenan]], [[Gene Okerlund]], [[Lord Alfred Hayes]] and others filled guest roles. For WrestleMania VII and VIII, Monsoon and Heenan provided color commentary. In the mid to late 1990s the commentator team comprised [[Vince McMahon]], [[Jim Ross]], and [[Jerry Lawler]]. Since the brand separation in 2002, matches from the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand have been called by Ross and Lawler; the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] matches called by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], [[Tazz]], [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] and [[Jonathan Coachman]], and from 2006 to 2010, the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] matches called by [[Joey Styles]] and Tazz. At WrestleMania XXV the first three-man inter-brand commentary team since the [[WWE Brand Extension]] was used, and consisted of Jim Ross, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, and [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The following year Jim Ross was replaced by [[Matt Striker]] at WrestleMania XXVI. At WrestleMania XXVII Jim Ross returned to commentate, along with [[Josh Mathews]] and new ''SmackDown'' color commentator [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]; the sudden change of commentary was due to a singles match between regular commentators Michael Cole and Lawler.

Mr. T returned for WrestleMania 2 while Hulk Hogan wrestled at the first nine events.]]\nThe World Wrestling Federation staged the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The main event was a tag-team match between the WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Mr. T]], accompanied by [[Jimmy Snuka]] against the team of [[Roddy Piper]] and [[Paul Orndorff]], who were accompanied by [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Cowboy Bob Orton]]. The financial and critical success of the event secured the company's status as the most successful promotion in the United States, rising above competitors such as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[American Wrestling Association]]. In attendance were business celebrity Sy Sperling and broadcasting executive Tony D'Angelo. WrestleMania 2 was held the following year and took place in three venues across the country. The [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]], the Rosemont Horizon (now [[Allstate Arena]]) in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Rosemont, Illinois]], and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] in Los Angeles. They each featured multiple matches that led up to the main event; this saw WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defeat the challenger [[King Kong Bundy]] in a [[Steel Cage match]].\n\nA world indoor attendance-record of 93,173 fans was set at WrestleMania III, which was also the largest paying attendance in the [[history of professional wrestling]] at the time. The event is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|1980s wrestling boom]]. To make certain that every seat in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] would be filled, WWF decided to exclude the entire state of Michigan from [[pay-per-view]] access to the event, which made attending the event the only way for fans in Michigan to see it.<ref name=\"A Hot Ticket\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/wmiiirememberedp1|title=WrestleMania III remembered|accessdate=2007-03-08|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070310162445/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/wmiiirememberedp1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-03-10}}</ref> The event featured Hulk Hogan defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] match between [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]]. The match between Savage and Steamboat would go on to be regarded as one of the best matches in WrestleMania history, is acknowledged by many (including Vince McMahon) as having \"stolen the show\".\n\nWrestleMania IV was held at the [[Atlantic City Convention Hall]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] (though on the broadcast it was billed as being held in the [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Trump Plaza]] because the adjacent [[casino]] hotel was the event's primary sponsor). The event was an all-tournament event to crown a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion, with four non-tournament matches to fill between the gaps in the tournament rounds. The second round of the tournament featured a rematch of the previous year's main event between Hulk Hogan and Andr\u00e9 the Giant while Randy Savage went on to defeat [[Ted DiBiase]] in the finals. The event returned the following year to Atlantic City for WrestleMania V, in which Hulk Hogan defeated Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship Savage had won the previous year. To date, this is the only time consecutive WrestleManias have been held in the same venue.\n\n===1990s===\n{{Location map+\n| USA\n| width          = 500\n| caption        = Venues of WrestleMania in the 1990s\n| float          =\n| border         =\n| alt            = Venues of WrestleMania in the 1990s\n| places         =\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VI|VI]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania VI\n  | lat_deg    = 43\n  | lat_min    = 38\n  | lat_sec    = 29\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 79\n  | lon_min    = 23\n  | lon_sec    = 21\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VII|VII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = top\n  | link       = WrestleMania VII\n  | lat_deg    = 34\n  | lat_min    = 0\n  | lat_sec    = 46.8\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 118\n  | lon_min    = 17\n  | lon_sec    = 6\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VIII|VIII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania VIII\n  | lat_deg    = 39\n  | lat_min    = 45\n  | lat_sec    = 49.17\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 86\n  | lon_min    = 9\n  | lon_sec    = 47.95\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania IX|IX]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania IX\n  | lat_deg    = 36\n  | lat_min    = 7\n  | lat_sec    = 4\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 115\n  | lon_min    = 10\n  | lon_sec    = 30\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania X|X]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania X\n  | lat_deg    = 40\n  | lat_min    = 45\n  | lat_sec    = 2\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 73\n  | lon_min    = 59\n  | lon_sec    = 37\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XI|XI]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XI\n  | lat_deg    = 41\n  | lat_min    = 46\n  | lat_sec    = 6\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 72\n  | lon_min    = 40\n  | lon_sec    = 37\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XII|XII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = bottom\n  | link       = WrestleMania XII\n  | lat_deg    = 33\n  | lat_min    = 48\n  | lat_sec    = 28\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 117\n  | lon_min    = 52\n  | lon_sec    = 36\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 13|13]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania 13\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 0\n  | lat_sec    = 19\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 87\n  | lon_min    = 53\n  | lon_sec    = 16\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XIV|XIV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = right\n  | link       = WrestleMania XIV\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 21\n  | lat_sec    = 58.69\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 71\n  | lon_min    = 3\n  | lon_sec    = 44.02\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XV|XV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XV\n  | lat_deg    = 39\n  | lat_min    = 54\n  | lat_sec    = 4\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 75\n  | lon_min    = 10\n  | lon_sec    = 19\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe first time WrestleMania took place outside of the United States was WrestleMania VI, which was held at the SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) in [[Toronto]], Canada. In the main event match, [[The Ultimate Warrior]] won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan. The following year, the event returned to the United States for WrestleMania VII, which was originally scheduled to be held at the outdoors [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. The event was moved to the adjacent indoors [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] after poor ticket sales, sold on television as being for security reasons related to the [[Gulf War]] and [[Sgt.

It was also the first and only time in WrestleMania history that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship switched twice. Yokozuna defeated Bret Hart to become the WWF World Heavyweight Champion, only to lose it to Hulk Hogan. In the tenth edition of the event, WrestleMania X saw its return to Madison Square Garden. The event featured [[Owen Hart]] defeating his elder brother Bret; a [[ladder match]] for the WWF Intercontinental Championship also headlined, in which [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] defeated [[Shawn Michaels]]. Bret having been defeated earlier won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Yokozuna in the main event. Bret is the first wrestler in WrestleMania history to lose his first match and come back to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. After failing to capture the title from [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] at WrestleMania XI, Michaels defeated Bret Hart to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a 60-minute [[Iron Man match]] at WrestleMania XII. The match was widely praised. The event also saw the return of the Ultimate Warrior who defeated [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] (later known as Triple H) in the latter's WrestleMania debut.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania 13]], a [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission match]] pitted Bret Hart and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] against one another in a bout that received much acclaim and The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The match between Hart and Austin is considered by many fans as one of the best professional wrestling matches of all time and has been voted by [[IGN]] as the greatest match in WrestleMania history, and was number 1 among their list of top 20 WrestleMania matches of all time.<ref>https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/23/top-20-matches-in-wrestlemania-history?page=20</ref> Various other sources also names the match as the greatest WrestleMania match of all time.<ref>https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/the-10-best-wrestlemania-matches-in-history.html</ref>\n\nAt [[WrestleMania XIV]], Austin defeated Shawn Michaels to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion in a match that featured [[Mike Tyson]] serving as the special enforcer. Although Tyson had been aligned with Michaels and his [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] [[D-Generation X]], Tyson revealed to have been aligned with Austin all along as he personally counted the pinfall and declared Austin the winner.

WWE first produced the event in 1985 and has since produced 36 editions, with the [[WrestleMania 36|most recent]] having been held in [[Orlando, Florida]] on March 25\u201326, 2020 ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] April 4\u20135). WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event, airs on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It contributes to the worldwide commercial success of WWE through media, merchandise, and shows. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner [[Vince McMahon]], while long time WWE ring announcer and [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Howard Finkel]] is credited with devising the name \"WrestleMania\" in 1984.\n\nWrestleMania's widespread success helped transform professional wrestling. The event has facilitated the rise to stardom of several top WWE wrestlers. Celebrities such as [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mr. T]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Lawrence Taylor]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Diddy\" Combs]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Fred Durst]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] have participated or made special appearances within the events.\n\nThe [[WrestleMania I|first WrestleMania]] was held in [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]; the 10th and 20th editions were also held there. [[WrestleMania III]] in the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Pontiac, Michigan]] was the highest-attended indoor sports event in the world, with 93,173 fans in attendance. The record stood until February 14, 2010, when the [[2010 NBA All-Star Game]] broke the indoor sporting event record with an attendance of 108,713 at Cowboys Stadium, since renamed [[AT&T Stadium]], in [[Arlington, Texas]].<ref name=\"AP recap\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300214032|title=East wins in front of biggest crowd to watch hoops game |publisher=ESPN|date=February 14, 2010|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> In 2016, WrestleMania 32 surpassed WrestleMania III as the highest-attended professional wrestling event ever held in America, with 101,763 fans in attendance at AT&T Stadium, although the company revealed that attendance figures are manipulated for marketing purposes through investor calls. All editions of the event have been hosted in North American cities, with 34 in the [[United States]] and two in [[Canada]].\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:WrestleMania 32 2016-04-03 18-55-46 ILCE-6000 9123 DxO (27799110291).jpg|thumb|right|[[AT&T Stadium]] during [[WrestleMania 32]].]]\nMost WrestleMania events have taken place in large stadiums in large cities, with some in sports arenas.

Other WWE championships are also contested for, while the [[Card (sports)|match card]] also includes gimmick matches and matches involving personal feuds.\n\nSince 1993, the winner of the annual [[Royal Rumble]] match has been able to receive a guaranteed WWE Championship match at the same year's WrestleMania. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship in 2002, the winner was also given the option to choose between the world title or the WWE championship. The creation of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in June 2006 gave the Rumble winner a third option: to choose to challenge for the [[ECW World Championship]]. This option was made available from 2007 until the brand was retired in 2010. However, this option was never chosen.<ref name=ecwtitle>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007/|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-05|date=2007-02-05}}</ref> The brand split ended in 2011 and the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships were unified in 2013, leaving the former as the only title to challenge for until the reintroduction of the brand split in 2016, which added the WWE Universal Championship as a choice. A women's Royal Rumble match was introduced in 2018, and the winner has the option of challenging for either the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] or [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]].\n\n[[WrestleMania 21]] saw the introduction of the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]]. This match features six to ten participants and took place at six WrestleManias between 2005 and 2010 before becoming the headline match of its own [[pay-per-view]] event, [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] which incorporated the use of two Money in the Bank ladder matches for both respective WWE brands, [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] and [[WWE Raw|Raw]]. The participant who retrieves the briefcase suspended above the ring wins a contract, which guarantees a world title match at the time and place of the winner's choosing for up to one year, including the following year's WrestleMania. This lasted until 2010 when the Money in the Bank pay per view was introduced and thus the Money in the Bank ladder match was retired from WrestleMania.<ref name=\"MITB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6464426/results/|accessdate=2008-05-23|title=Results:Money in the Bank ladder match| publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2008-03-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Forbes]] named WrestleMania one of the world's most valuable sports event brands from 2014 to 2017, ranking it sixth with a brand value of US$195 million in 2017 behind the [[Super Bowl]], [[Summer Olympics]], [[Winter Olympics]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Final Four]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/59e62ee431358e542c03d5be/6-wrestlemania/|title=Forbes Fab 40 2017|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=24 October 2017|date=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Commentators===\nFor five of the first six WrestleManias [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Jesse Ventura]] served as the color commentators (the exception being WrestleMania 2, which was split among three venues and had Monsoon, Ventura, and Vince McMahon split up with guest commentators), while [[Bobby Heenan]], [[Gene Okerlund]], [[Lord Alfred Hayes]] and others filled guest roles. For WrestleMania VII and VIII, Monsoon and Heenan provided color commentary. In the mid to late 1990s the commentator team comprised [[Vince McMahon]], [[Jim Ross]], and [[Jerry Lawler]]. Since the brand separation in 2002, matches from the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand have been called by Ross and Lawler; the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] matches called by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], [[Tazz]], [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] and [[Jonathan Coachman]], and from 2006 to 2010, the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] matches called by [[Joey Styles]] and Tazz. At WrestleMania XXV the first three-man inter-brand commentary team since the [[WWE Brand Extension]] was used, and consisted of Jim Ross, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, and [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The following year Jim Ross was replaced by [[Matt Striker]] at WrestleMania XXVI. At WrestleMania XXVII Jim Ross returned to commentate, along with [[Josh Mathews]] and new ''SmackDown'' color commentator [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]; the sudden change of commentary was due to a singles match between regular commentators Michael Cole and Lawler.

Mr. T returned for WrestleMania 2 while Hulk Hogan wrestled at the first nine events.]]\nThe World Wrestling Federation staged the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The main event was a tag-team match between the WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Mr. T]], accompanied by [[Jimmy Snuka]] against the team of [[Roddy Piper]] and [[Paul Orndorff]], who were accompanied by [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Cowboy Bob Orton]]. The financial and critical success of the event secured the company's status as the most successful promotion in the United States, rising above competitors such as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[American Wrestling Association]]. In attendance were business celebrity Sy Sperling and broadcasting executive Tony D'Angelo. WrestleMania 2 was held the following year and took place in three venues across the country. The [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]], the Rosemont Horizon (now [[Allstate Arena]]) in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Rosemont, Illinois]], and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] in Los Angeles. They each featured multiple matches that led up to the main event; this saw WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defeat the challenger [[King Kong Bundy]] in a [[Steel Cage match]].\n\nA world indoor attendance-record of 93,173 fans was set at WrestleMania III, which was also the largest paying attendance in the [[history of professional wrestling]] at the time. The event is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|1980s wrestling boom]]. To make certain that every seat in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] would be filled, WWF decided to exclude the entire state of Michigan from [[pay-per-view]] access to the event, which made attending the event the only way for fans in Michigan to see it.<ref name=\"A Hot Ticket\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/wmiiirememberedp1|title=WrestleMania III remembered|accessdate=2007-03-08|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070310162445/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/wmiiirememberedp1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-03-10}}</ref> The event featured Hulk Hogan defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] match between [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]]. The match between Savage and Steamboat would go on to be regarded as one of the best matches in WrestleMania history, is acknowledged by many (including Vince McMahon) as having \"stolen the show\".\n\nWrestleMania IV was held at the [[Atlantic City Convention Hall]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] (though on the broadcast it was billed as being held in the [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Trump Plaza]] because the adjacent [[casino]] hotel was the event's primary sponsor). The event was an all-tournament event to crown a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion, with four non-tournament matches to fill between the gaps in the tournament rounds. The second round of the tournament featured a rematch of the previous year's main event between Hulk Hogan and Andr\u00e9 the Giant while Randy Savage went on to defeat [[Ted DiBiase]] in the finals. The event returned the following year to Atlantic City for WrestleMania V, in which Hulk Hogan defeated Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship Savage had won the previous year. To date, this is the only time consecutive WrestleMania's have been held in the same venue.\n\n===1990s===\n{{Location map+\n| USA\n| width          = 500\n| caption        = Venues of WrestleMania in the 1990s\n| float          =\n| border         =\n| alt            = Venues of WrestleMania in the 1990s\n| places         =\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VI|VI]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania VI\n  | lat_deg    = 43\n  | lat_min    = 38\n  | lat_sec    = 29\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 79\n  | lon_min    = 23\n  | lon_sec    = 21\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VII|VII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = top\n  | link       = WrestleMania VII\n  | lat_deg    = 34\n  | lat_min    = 0\n  | lat_sec    = 46.8\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 118\n  | lon_min    = 17\n  | lon_sec    = 6\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania VIII|VIII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania VIII\n  | lat_deg    = 39\n  | lat_min    = 45\n  | lat_sec    = 49.17\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 86\n  | lon_min    = 9\n  | lon_sec    = 47.95\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania IX|IX]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania IX\n  | lat_deg    = 36\n  | lat_min    = 7\n  | lat_sec    = 4\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 115\n  | lon_min    = 10\n  | lon_sec    = 30\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania X|X]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania X\n  | lat_deg    = 40\n  | lat_min    = 45\n  | lat_sec    = 2\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 73\n  | lon_min    = 59\n  | lon_sec    = 37\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XI|XI]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XI\n  | lat_deg    = 41\n  | lat_min    = 46\n  | lat_sec    = 6\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 72\n  | lon_min    = 40\n  | lon_sec    = 37\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XII|XII]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = bottom\n  | link       = WrestleMania XII\n  | lat_deg    = 33\n  | lat_min    = 48\n  | lat_sec    = 28\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 117\n  | lon_min    = 52\n  | lon_sec    = 36\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 13|13]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania 13\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 0\n  | lat_sec    = 19\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 87\n  | lon_min    = 53\n  | lon_sec    = 16\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XIV|XIV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = right\n  | link       = WrestleMania XIV\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 21\n  | lat_sec    = 58.69\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 71\n  | lon_min    = 3\n  | lon_sec    = 44.02\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XV|XV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XV\n  | lat_deg    = 39\n  | lat_min    = 54\n  | lat_sec    = 4\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 75\n  | lon_min    = 10\n  | lon_sec    = 19\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe first time WrestleMania took place outside of the United States was WrestleMania VI, which was held at the SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) in [[Toronto]], Canada.

The event featured [[Owen Hart]] defeating his elder brother Bret; a [[ladder match]] for the WWF Intercontinental Championship also headlined, in which [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] defeated [[Shawn Michaels]]. Bret having been defeated earlier won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Yokozuna in the main event. Bret is the first wrestler in WrestleMania history to lose his first match and come back to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. After failing to capture the title from [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] at WrestleMania XI, Michaels defeated Bret Hart to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a 60-minute [[Iron Man match]] at WrestleMania XII. The match was widely praised. The event also saw the return of the Ultimate Warrior who defeated [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] (later known as Triple H) in the latter's WrestleMania debut.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania 13]], a [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission match]] pitted Bret Hart and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] against one another in a bout that received much acclaim and The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The match between Hart and Austin is considered by many fans as one of the best professional wrestling matches of all time and has been voted by [[IGN]] as the greatest match in WrestleMania history, and was number 1 among their list of top 20 WrestleMania matches of all time.<ref>https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/23/top-20-matches-in-wrestlemania-history?page=20</ref> Various other sources also names the match as the greatest WrestleMania match of all time.<ref>https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/the-10-best-wrestlemania-matches-in-history.html</ref>\n\nAt [[WrestleMania XIV]], Austin defeated Shawn Michaels to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion in a match that featured [[Mike Tyson]] serving as the special enforcer. Although Tyson had been aligned with Michaels and his [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] [[D-Generation X]], Tyson revealed to have been aligned with Austin all along as he personally counted the pinfall and declared Austin the winner. [[The Undertaker]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] fought for the first time at this event where The Undertaker won. The following year at [[WrestleMania XV]], Austin defeated [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to regain the WWF Championship. The event featured the first of three encounters at WrestleMania between Austin and The Rock in the rivalry of the two most prominent and popular stars of The Attitude Era.\n\n===2000s===\n{{Location map+\n| USA\n| width          = 500\n| caption        = Venues of WrestleMania in the 2000s\n| float          =\n| border         =\n| alt            = Venues of WrestleMania in the 2000s\n| places         =\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 2000|2000]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = bottom\n  | link       = WrestleMania 2000\n  | lat_deg    = 33\n  | lat_min    = 48\n  | lat_sec    = 28\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 117\n  | lon_min    = 52\n  | lon_sec    = 36\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania X-Seven|X-Seven]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = left\n  | link       = \n  | lat_deg    = 29\n  | lat_min    = 40\n  | lat_sec    = 56\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 95\n  | lon_min    = 24\n  | lon_sec    = 31\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania X8|X8]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania X8\n  | lat_deg    = 43\n  | lat_min    = 38\n  | lat_sec    = 29\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 79\n  | lon_min    = 23\n  | lon_sec    = 21\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XIX|XIX]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XIX\n  | lat_deg    = 47\n  | lat_min    = 35\n  | lat_sec    = 27.6\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 122\n  | lon_min    = 19\n  | lon_sec    = 58.8\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XX|XX]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XX\n  | lat_deg    = 40\n  | lat_min    = 45\n  | lat_sec    = 2\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 73\n  | lon_min    = 59\n  | lon_sec    = 37\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 21|21]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = top\n  | link       = WrestleMania 21\n  | lat_deg    = 34\n  | lat_min    = 2\n  | lat_sec    = 35\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 118\n  | lon_min    = 16\n  | lon_sec    = 2\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 22|22]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania 22\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 0\n  | lat_sec    = 19\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 87\n  | lon_min    = 53\n  | lon_sec    = 16\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania 23|23]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = right\n  | link       = WrestleMania 23\n  | lat_deg    = 42\n  | lat_min    = 20\n  | lat_sec    = 24\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 83\n  | lon_min    = 2\n  | lon_sec    = 44\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XXIV|XXIV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = \n  | link       = WrestleMania XXIV\n  | lat_deg    = 28\n  | lat_min    = 32\n  | lat_sec    = 21\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 81\n  | lon_min    = 24\n  | lon_sec    = 10\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n  {{Location map~\n  | USA\n  | label      = [[WrestleMania XXV|XXV]]\n  | label_size = \n  | position   = right\n  | link       = \n  | lat_deg    = 29\n  | lat_min    = 40\n  | lat_sec    = 56\n  | lat_dir    = N\n  | lon_deg    = 95\n  | lon_min    = 24\n  | lon_sec    = 31\n  | lon_dir    = W\n  }}\n}}\n\n[[WrestleMania 2000]] featured the first-ever Triangle Ladder match for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], involving [[The Hardy Boyz]], [[The Dudley Boyz]] and [[Edge and Christian]].
