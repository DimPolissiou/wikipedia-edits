Up to four age classes may exist within each group, although some sugar gliders are solitary, not belonging to a group.<ref name=suckling1 /> They engage in [[social grooming]], which in addition to improving hygiene and health, helps bond the colony and establish group identity.\n\nWithin social communities, there are two codominant males who suppress subordinate males, but show no aggression towards each other. These co-dominant pairs are more related to each other than to subordinates within the group; and share food, nests, mates, and responsibility for scent marking of community members and territories.<ref name=Klettenheimer1>{{cite journal|last1=Klettenheimer|first1=B|last2=Temple-Smith|first2=P|last3=Sofrondis|first3=G|title=Father and son sugar gliders: more than a genetic coalition?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=1997|volume=242|issue=4|pages=741\u2013750|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb05823.x}}</ref>\n\nTerritory and members of the group are marked with saliva and a scent produced by separate glands on the forehead and chest of male gliders. Intruders who lack the appropriate scent marking are expelled violently.<ref name=\"dpiwtas\"/> Rank is established through scent marking; and fighting does not occur within groups, but does occur when communities come into contact with each other.<ref name=smith(73) /> Within the colony, no fighting typically takes place beyond threatening behaviour.<ref>Pasatta, J.

It is [[endemic]] to [[Southwest Australia (ecoregion)|southwest Australia]] and often occurs in [[jarrah forest]]s. It may only attain a height of half a metre or form an above trunk up to two metres with long arching fronds of a similar length. The giant cones amidst the crown of palm-like fronds contain edible seeds surrounded by red [[sarcotesta]]. The seeds are consumed by birds and animals, and can be a favoured part of the human diet when prepared correctly. ''M. riedlei'' benefits from a close association with bacteria that [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]], which also produce substances found throughout the plant that are toxic to some animals when consumed. The species is cultivated for ornamental use in urban and domestic environments.\n\n==Description==\n''Macrozamia riedlei'' grows as a tree or trunkless low growing cycad (but is usually trunkless)<ref name=FloraBase/><ref name=\"Hill1998\"/> attaining a height between {{convert|0.5|\u2013|3.0|m}}.<ref name=\"FloraBase\" /> Between 12 and 30 glossy mid- to dark-green leaves emerge from its crown, each reaching {{convert|1.2|to|2.2|m}} long and bearing 92\u2013150 pinnae.<ref name=\"Hill1998\"/> The leaves are palm-like, each frond having a thickened mid-rib with the pinnae evenly arranged at either side.<ref name=\"Serventy1970\" /> The flowering period occurs between September and October.<ref name=\"FloraBase\" />\n\nThe [[dioecious]] genus is noted for the large size of the reproductive structure, and this species is remarkable in several of those aspects.

It is [[endemic]] to [[Southwest Australia (ecoregion)|southwest Australia]] and often occurs in [[jarrah forest]]s. It may only attain a height of half a metre or form an above trunk up to two metres with long arching fronds of a similar length. The giant cones amidst the crown of palm-like fronds contain edible seeds surrounded by red [[sarcotesta]]. The seeds are consumed by birds and animals, and can be a favoured part of the human diet when prepared correctly. ''M. riedlei'' benefits from a close association with bacteria that [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]], which also produce substances found throughout the plant that are toxic to some animals when consumed. The species is cultivated for ornamental use in urban and domestic environments.\n\n==Description==\n''Macrozamia riedlei'' grows as a tree or trunkless low growing cycad (but is usually trunkless)<ref name=FloraBase/><ref name=\"Hill1998\"/> attaining a height between {{convert|0.5|\u2013|3.0|m}}.<ref name=\"FloraBase\" /> Between 12 and 30 glossy mid- to dark-green leaves emerge from its crown, each reaching {{convert|1.2|to|2.2|m}} long and bearing 92\u2013150 pinnae.<ref name=\"Hill1998\"/> The leaves are palm-like, each frond having a thickened mid-rib with the pinnae evenly arranged at either side.<ref name=\"Serventy1970\" /> The flowering period occurs between September and October.<ref name=\"FloraBase\" />\n\nThe [[dioecious]] genus is noted for the large size of the reproductive structure, and this species is remarkable in several of those aspects. The female cone measures {{convert|120|\u2013|250|mm}} wide and {{convert|250|\u2013|500|mm}} long, and the weight has been recorded up to {{convert|14|kg}}; the [[egg]]s and [[spermatozoid]]s are visible to the naked eye.<ref name=\"Hopper\" /> The cones persist on the plant for many months, the smaller pollen-bearing cone remaining green and the larger female cone becoming prominently red. [[Spore]]s are contained in small box-like structures on the underside of the leaf until ripe, a similar structure at the receptive cone is reduced to two seeds that remain attached to the leaf.<ref name=\"Serventy1970\" />\n\nIt differs from other West Australian macrozamias in that it is generally trunkless, smaller, has fewer and glossier flat leaves, and has smaller cones.<ref name=\"Hill1998\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy ==\nThe first species description was published as ''Cycas riedlei'' by [[Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer]], based on a specimen collected at [[King George Sound]] and held at the Paris museum.<ref name=\"ALA\" /><ref name=EJ93/><ref name=gaud>Published in:Gaudichaud-Beaupre, C.

He and his younger brother [[Art Powell (wide receiver)|Art Powell]], an NFL wide receiver for the New York Titans and [[Oakland Raiders]] in the 1960s, grew up in the Logan Heights area of [[San Diego, California]].\n\nPowell played professional baseball and football as well as boxed.  His greatest success was as an NFL player and a boxer, even boxing against Muhammad Ali.\n\n==High school==\nCharlie starred in football, basketball, track and baseball at [[San Diego High School]]. In 1950, as a 6'-3\", 230-pound defensive end and offensive end, with tremendous power and speed, he was named the California high school football player of the year. In track, he ran 100 yards in 9.6 seconds and threw the [[shot put]] 57 feet 9\u00bc inches.  In basketball, he was a second-team all-league center.  As a high school baseball player, he hit balls out of San Diego Balboa Stadium.  He turned a down an offer of a tryout by the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n==Baseball career==\nAfter high school, Charlie was recruited by Notre Dame and UCLA to play football, [[St. Louis Browns]] baseball owner [[Bill Veeck]], who had acquired the legendary pitcher [[Satchel Paige]] from the [[Cleveland Indians]], signed the power-hitting outfielder to a professional baseball contract. He was sent to the Stockton Ports, a Class B minor league team.\n\n==Football career==\nBut after playing pro baseball in the summer of 1952, Charlie suddenly abandoned his pro baseball career and signed a pro football contract with the San Francisco 49ers. At 19, he became the youngest player in NFL history. In his first game, he started against the NFL champion Detroit Lions and had multiple sacks against QB Bobby Layne, totalling 67 yards in sack yardage.\n\nPowell played five seasons in the NFL for the 49ers (1952\u201353 and 1955\u201357) and two for the Oakland Raiders (1960\u201361).\n\n==Boxing career==\nPowell was also a professional boxer.  In March 1959, on television, he knocked out [[Nino Valdes]] of Cuba who was the number 2 ranked heavyweight fighter in the world at the time. He fought [[Muhammad Ali]] (who was then known as Cassius Clay) at the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]] on January 24, 1963. Ali knocked out Powell in the third round, as Ali predicted before the fight. He finished his pro boxing career with a record of 25-11-3.  In his career, Charlie also fought [[Floyd Patterson]], losing to him in 6 rounds.\n\n==Retirement==\nPowell is a member of the Breitbard San Diego Hall of Fame.  He was last known to be living in the [[Pasadena, California]] area.\n\n==Death==\nPowell died on September 1, 2014 at age of 82 after living with dementia for several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/sep/01/charlie-powell-death-athlete/|title=NFL great Charlie Powell dead at 82|first=Chris|last=Jenkins|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-charlie-powell-20140903-story.html|title=Charlie Powell dies at 82; NFL player who boxed Ali, Patterson - Los Angeles Times|first=Lance Pugmire, By Lance|last=Pugmire|website=latimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://archive.is/20140902185455/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/sep/01/charlie-powell-death-athlete/NFL great Charlie Powell dead at 82]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091002220920/http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/football/charlie-powell/ San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum]\n*[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/26/first-foremost-powells/ First & foremost: Powells are royal family]\n*[https://archive.is/20130122101049/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/weblog/news.php?p=16105&more=1 One of the Best Athletes of All time May Have Been a Boxer]\n* {{boxrec|id=9377}}\n*[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/171502-the-greatest-49er-athlete-ever The Greatest 49ers Athlete Ever]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120917213206/http://www.esportsinstruction.com/page002.html eSportsInstruction.com - Pro Advisory Board Members]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Powell, Charlie}}\n[[Category:1932 births]]\n[[Category:2014 deaths]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Dallas]]\n[[Category:American football defensive linemen]]\n[[Category:San Francisco 49ers players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Raiders players]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox gridiron football person\n| name = Charlie Powell\n| image = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{birth date|1932|04|4}}\n| birth_place = [[Dallas, Texas]]\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|2014|9|1|1932|4|2}}\n| death_place = [[San Diego, California]]\n| team = \n| number = \n| status = \n| position1 = [[Defensive lineman|DL]]\n| height_ft = \n| height_in = \n| weight_lb = \n| college = none\n| playing_years1 = 1952\u20131957\n| playing_team1 = [[San Francisco 49ers]]\n| playing_years2 = 1960\u20131961\n| playing_team2 = [[Oakland Raiders]]\n| career_highlights = \n| DatabaseFootball = POWELCHA01\n}}\n'''Charles Elvin Powell''' (April 4, 1932 \u2013 September 1, 2014) was a multi-sport professional athlete as an [[NFL]] football player, professional boxer (who once fought both Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson), and Minor League baseball player.\n\nPowell was born in Texas.

The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it. \n\nSuch people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,<ref>{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref> and similar characters. \n\nThe money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.\n\nTo help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}</ref> 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple \"people\" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nOnce the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as \"To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced fee fraud.<ref name=\"EFCC\">{{cite web|title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act of 2004 |url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |publisher=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Nigeria) |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080831/http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref> In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they have adopted smart technology developed by [[Microsoft]] to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed \"Eagle Claw\", running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.<ref name=\"AFP_2009\"/>\n\nSome individuals participate in a practice known as [[scam baiting]], in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for real victims.<ref name=\"Cheng_Jacqui\">{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit).|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/05/baiting-nigerian-scammers-for-fun-not-so-much-for-profit/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 11, 2009}}</ref> Details on the practice of scam baiting, and ideas, are chronicled on a website, [[419eater.com]], launched in 2003 by Michael Berry. One particularly notable case of scam baiting involved an American who identified himself to a Nigerian scammer as [[James T. Kirk]]. When the scammer \u2014 who apparently had never heard of the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' \u2014 asked for his passport details, \"Kirk\" sent a copy of a fake passport with a photo of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s Captain Kirk, hoping the scammer would attempt to use it and get arrested.<ref name=\"Corbin_Jane\">{{cite news|last=Corbin|first=Jane|title=A mysterious email and a split-second mistake: That's all it took for internet gangsters to hijack my life...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1243634/A-mysterious-email-split-second-mistake-Thats-took-internet-gangsters-hijack-life-.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=January 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Common elements==\n===Irreversible money transfers===\nA central element of advance-fee fraud is the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.<ref name=\"StateDeptPub10465\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job?

The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations.

They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving.

The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nNumerous scam websites may be used for this scam.

This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing.

The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it. \n\nSuch people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,<ref>{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref> and similar characters. \n\nThe money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.\n\nTo help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}</ref> 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple \"people\" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nOnce the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as \"To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams.

Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.<ref name=\"StateDeptPub10465\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job? Security at work-applicant sites faulted|last=Menn|first=Joseph|date=2007-11-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother form of employment scam involves making people receive a fake \"interview\" where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.<ref name=\"Grant_Bob\">{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Bob|title=Another fake conference?|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=November 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them.<ref name=\"Sichelman_Lew\">{{cite news|last=Sichelman|first=Lew|title=Rental scams can target either landlords or tenants|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/25/business/la-fi-lew-20120325|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 2012}}</ref> Or the [[con artist]] finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit.<ref name=\"Aho_Karen\">{{cite news|last=Aho|first=Karen|title=Renters: Beware of new twists on an old scam|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[MSN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090312/http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged check is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.<ref name=\"McKee_Chris\">{{cite news|last=McKee |first=Chris |title=Room rental internet scam takes Eugene college students for thousands |url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[KMTR]] |date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120215930/http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Pet scams===\nThis is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like [[Craigslist]], [[Gumtree]], and [[Junk Mail Digital Media|JunkMail]]. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nNumerous scam websites may be used for this scam.

The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public for installation of mobile towers on their property. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.<ref>{{cite web|title = Measures to Protect Consumer Interest - Consumer Info: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|url = http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|website = www.trai.gov.in|access-date = 2016-02-20|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212020852/http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Mass Marketing Frauds in the garb of Mobile Towers in India: Evolving a Framework to handle it|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294219016|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|doi = 10.13140/RG.2.1.4630.2480|last = Kumar|first = Harish|year = 2016}}</ref> This fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://propakistani.pk/2010/10/09/fraud-of-the-year-minting-money-by-acquiring-land-for-towers/|title=Fraud of the Year: Minting Money by Acquiring Land for Towers|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Villagers-fall-prey-to-mobile-tower-scam/articleshow/47697564.cms|title=Villagers fall prey to mobile tower scam - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===Other scams===\nOther scams involve unclaimed property, also called \"[[bona vacantia]]\" in the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[England and Wales]] (other than the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Fraudulent emails and letters claiming to be from this department have been reported, informing the recipient they are the beneficiary of a legacy but requiring the payment of a fee before sending more information or releasing the money.<ref name=\"Bona_Vacantia\">{{cite web|title=Scam Email Warnings. |url=http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |publisher=Bona Vacantia |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712102227/http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |archivedate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> In the [[United States]], messages are falsely claimed to be from the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a real organization, but one that does not and cannot itself make payments.<ref name=\"Leamy_Elisabeth\">{{cite news|last=Leamy|first=Elisabeth|title=Beware of Unclaimed Money Scams|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/beware-unclaimed-money-scam/story?id=14293877#.T-aW4StYuxI|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn one variant of 419 fraud, an alleged [[hitman]] writes to someone explaining he has been targeted to kill them. He tells them he knows the allegations against them are false, and asks for money so the target can receive evidence of the person who ordered the hit.<ref name=\"Snopes_Hitman\">{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=Hitman Scam.|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/hitman.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of advanced fee fraud is known as a pigeon drop. This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an [[accomplice]]).<ref name=\"Zak_Paul\">{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|title=How to Run a Con|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-molecule/200811/how-run-con|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers will go after the victims of previous scams; known as a [[reloading scam]]. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim, for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee. The recovery scammers obtain lists of victims by buying them from the original scammers.<ref name=\"Snopes_Victim_Scam\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Mikkelson|title=Scam Me Twice, Shame On Me, ...|url=https://www.snopes.com/scam-me-twice-shame-on-me/|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nEstimates of the total losses due to the scam are uncertain and vary widely, since many people may be too embarrassed to admit that they were gullible enough to be scammed to report the crime.

Both sides were joined by a great number of allies dragging the entire east of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and large parts of Asia ([[Asia Minor]], [[Greater Armenia]], Northern [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]) into the war. The conflict ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic Kingdom]], ending the [[Seleucid Empire]], and also resulting in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] becoming an allied [[client state]] of Rome.\n\n==Background==\nIn 120 BC, [[Mithridates V]], the king of Pontus was poisoned by persons unknown.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.68</ref> The conspirators were probably working for his wife [[Laodice IV|Laodice]].<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 6</ref> In his will Mithridates V left the kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice, Mithridates VI and [[Mithridates Chrestus]]. Both of her sons were underage and Laodice retained all power as regent.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.69</ref> Laodice in her regency favored her second son (Chrestus was probably more pliable). During her regency 120\u2013116 BC (perhaps even 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped the court of his mother and went into hiding.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.69</ref> He returned between 116\u2013113 BC and able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontic throne, thus becoming the sole ruler of Pontus.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.394</ref>\n\nMithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the east of Asia Minor and the [[Black Sea]] region. He first subjugated [[Colchis]], a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the [[Pontic steppe]] with the [[Scythian]] King [[Palacus]]. The most important cities and people of the [[Crimea]], the [[Tauric Chersonesus]] and the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] readily surrendered their independence in return for Mithridates' protection against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. The Scythians and their allies the [[Rhoxolanoi]] suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] and accepted Mithridates as their overlord.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 13-18</ref>\n\nThe young king then turned his attention to Asia Minor, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition [[Paphlagonia]] and [[Galatia]] with King [[Nicomedes III of Bithynia]]. Yet it soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of [[Kingdom of Cappadocia|Cappadocia]], and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95\u201392 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war. By this time Mithridates had resolved to expel the Romans from Asia.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 19-24</ref>\n\nThe next ruler of [[Bithynia]], [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]], was a [[Puppet ruler|figurehead]] manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were few Roman troops available. The Romans therefore mustered a great number of Asian levies and combined with Nicomedes' army they invade Mithridates' kingdom in 89 BC. Mithridates won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious forces were welcomed throughout Asia Minor. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and [[Italic peoples|Italian]] settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. 80,000 people are said to have perished in this massacre. The episode is known as the [[Asiatic Vespers]].<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 25-47</ref>\n\nThe Romans responded by organising a large invasion force (this time sending their own legions) to defeat him and remove him from power. The [[First Mithridatic War]], fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] force Mithridates out of Greece proper. After being victorious in several battles Sulla, being declared an outlaw by his political opponents in Rome, hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sulla returned to Italy [[Lucius Licinius Murena]] was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to restore his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the [[Second Mithridatic War]] from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates defeated Murena's two green legions at the [[Battle of Halys]] in 82 BC before peace was again declared by treaty.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 57-100</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nThe period between the Second and Third wars of Rome and the Pontic Kingdom (81\u201375 BC) is discussed under the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. There it can be seen how the long piracy wars were a development out of the [[First Mithridatic War]] and especially of the alliance between [[Mithridates VI]] and [[Sertorius]], which in joining those two threats into a unity much larger than its parts had the serious potential of overturning Roman power. The immediate cause of the Third War was the bequest to Rome by King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia of his kingdom upon his death (74 BC). Mithridates, who had been rebuilding his forces, launched an invasion of Bithynia.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 101-102</ref>\n\n== Forces and initial deployments, 74\u201373 BC ==\nHaving launched an attack at the same time as a revolt by [[Sertorius]] swept through the Spanish provinces, Mithridates was initially virtually unopposed. The Senate responded by sending the consuls [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Cotta (consul 74 BC)|Marcus Aurelius Cotta]] to deal with the Pontic threat. The only other possible general for such an important command, [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]], was in [[Hispania]] to help [[Metellus Pius]] crush the revolt led by Sertorius. Lucullus was sent to govern [[Cilicia]] and Cotta to [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia]].<ref>Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, ''A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography'', 1860, pg. 226</ref> According to Appian and Plutarch Lucullus had 30,000 infantry and 1,600-2,500 cavalry while Mithridates was rumoured to have as many as 300,000 men in his force.<ref>Appian, ''Mithridatica'', XI.72; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 8.</ref>\n\nThe original plan was that Cotta should tie down Mithridates' fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta was therefore ordered to station his fleet at [[Chalcedon]], while Lucullus marched through [[Phrygia]] with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked and defeated Cotta at the [[Battle of Chalcedon (74 BC)|battle of Chalcedon]], and forced him to flee behind the walls of Chalcedon. Sixty-four Roman ships had been captured or burnt, and Cotta had lost three thousand men.<ref>Holmes, T. Rice, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I'', 1923, pg. 180</ref><ref>Appian ''Mithridates''. 71; Plutarch. ''Lucullus''. 8</ref>  There Cotta was forced to remain until Lucullus could come to his rescue.<ref>[[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton|T. Robert S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 99</ref>\n\n==Mithridates\u2019 defeat in western Asia, 73-72 BC==\nHaving made his way to [[Nicomedia]], Cotta watched in frustration as Mithridates marched on taking [[Nicaea]], [[Lampsacus]], [[Nicomedia]] and Apameia, all major cities in the region. Only nearby [[Cyzicus]] held to the Roman cause, probably because many of its citizens (serving in Cotta's army as [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]]) had died fighting against Mithridates at Chalcedon. The Pontic army marched on Cyzicus and began a siege.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's indomitable Enemy'', pp 106-113; Plutarch ''Life of Lucullus'', 8.</ref>\n\nLucullus was camped somewhere along the [[Sakarya River|Sangarius river]] in Bithynia when he received news of Cotta's defeat. His soldiers urged him to leave Cotta to his own folly and march on undefended Pontus with its rich potential for loot. Lucullus ignored them and headed toward Chalcedon. [[Marcus Marius (quaestor)|Marcus Marius]], a Roman rebel cooperating with Mithridates, blocked and confronted him. They faced off at Otroea near Nicaea (present-day [[Iznik]]).<ref>Keaveney, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref> Although Lucullus commanded 30,000 infantry and 2,500 horse, he was daunted by the size of the opposing army and reluctant to engage. The arrival of an omen, as reported by Plutarch, was thus fortuitous:<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html#8.5 8.]</ref>\n\n{{cquote|But presently, as they were on the point of joining battle, with no apparent change of weather, but all on a sudden, the sky burst asunder, and a huge, flame-like body was seen to fall between the two armies. In shape, it was most like a wine-jar ''([[pithos]])'', and in colour, like molten silver. Both sides were astonished at the sight, and separated. This marvel, as they say, occurred in [[Phrygia]], at a place called [[Otryae]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html#8.5 8.6\u20137,] [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation, Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]].</ref>}}\n\nNo battle occurred. For Marius, delay posed a logistical problem. He had only a few days of supplies for his troops. Lucullus learned of the shortage through prisoner interrogations and decided to wait him out. Marius was forced to move on without the fight he had sought.\n\n===The Siege of Cyzicus===\n{{main|Siege of Cyzicus|Battle of the Rhyndacus (73 BC)}}\nWhile Mithridates was besieging Cyzicus Lucullus and his army arrived; the Romans, with the help of some turncoats, were able to establish a counter-siege, trapping Mithridates' army on the Cyzicus [[peninsula]]. During the siege Mithridates sent his cavalry, with the sick and the wounded away, but they were ambushed and slaughtered at the river Rhyndacus. In the middle of a snowstorm, Lucullus met these forces with ten cohorts and attacked them in mid-crossing on both sides of the river. [[Plutarch]] and [[Appian]] record 15,000 men and 6,000 horses as being captured during the battle.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 60; Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', p. 112.</ref> The disaster at the Rhyndacus combined with the famine and a plague which had struck his main army forced Mithridates to completely abandoned his position, sailing north while his army marched overland. Lucullus pursued the army and defeated them at the confluence of the [[Aesepus River|Aesepus]] and [[Granicus River]]s slaughtering many (20,000 were killed while crossing the river Granicus). Eventually, of the 300,000 who had set out for Bithynia only 20,000 effective troops remained. The siege of Cyzicus and the subsequent retreat could be considered an unmitigated disaster.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 112-113.</ref>\n\n===The naval campaign===\nMarcus Marius, having survived the Cyzicus campaign, had taken to the sea. Along with Mithridates's admirals Alexandros the Paphlagonian and Dionysios Eunuchos (\"the [[Eunuch]]\"), he was placed in joint command of 50 ships and 10,000 handpicked men, among them, in the words of [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], \"the flower of the Roman emigrants.\"<ref>[[Theodor Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', vol. 4, p. 329.</ref> Their intention seems to have been to sail east into the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], but Lucullus mounted an attack against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of [[Tenedos]] and the mainland harbor of the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]]. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between [[Lemnos]] and [[Scyros]]; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea.<ref>Keaveney, ''Lucullus'', p. 85.</ref> Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet provided by Mithradates and additional transport vessels. Dionysios committed suicide, but Alexandros was captured and held for display in Lucullus's anticipated [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. Among the dead were a number of men who had been on [[Proscription#Proscription of 82 BC|Sulla's proscription lists]]. Marius at first escaped, possibly from a sinking ship, since he was later found ashore taking refuge in a cave.<ref>[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] 6.2.21\u201322.</ref>\n\nLike Sertorius himself, Marius at some point had lost an eye; when Lucullus gave the order to track down enemy survivors, he specified that no one-eyed men should be killed, so that he could personally oversee the renegade's death: \"Lucullus wished Marius to die under the most shameful insults.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 12.5.</ref> Orosius reports that he atoned for his rebellious spirit with penalties he earned.<ref>Orosius 6.2.2.</ref>\n\n==Lucullus invades Pontus, 71-69 BC==\nIn 72 BC Lucullus marched his army through [[Galatia]] and into Pontus. The [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]] were only too happy to supply the Romans because they detested Mithridates and were keen to see the Roman legions pass through their country without being plundered.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy''; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 14.</ref> Once Lucullus was in the Pontic heartland and he let his troops plunder the rich and fertile area. Mithridates could do nothing to stop the despoiling of his lands for he had to rebuild his army. He eventually assembled 40,000 men (4,000 cavalry) near Cabira and waited for Lucullus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 119; Appian, ''Mithridatica'', 78.</ref>\n\n===Cabira===\n{{main|Battle of Cabira}}\nAfter careful manoeuvering Lucullus occupied an old fortress on the heights overlooking Cabira. This was a secure and very defensible position, but its location meant the Romans were cut off from their recent conquests in Pontus and their supply lines now had to come north from [[Cappadocia]], a Roman ally to the south of Pontus. Since Mithridates dominated the countryside, Lucullus had to send out heavily armed convoys to get supplies. A supply convoy, escorted by no less than ten cohorts of infantry (c.3,000-5,000 men), under the command of the legate Sornatius was attacked by the Pontic cavalry. The Roman infantry stood their ground and held off the attack inflicting terrible losses on the Pontic horsemen. When a second supply convoy, also heavily armed, under the command of Marcus Fabius Hadrianus made for Lucullus' camp Mithridates decided to use a [[combined arms]] (infantry and cavalry) force. Some 4,000 cavalry and infantry fell upon the convoy, unfortunately, the Romans realized the narrow valley at the scene limited the effectiveness of their opponents' cavalry and they [[Counterattack|counter-attacked]] wiping out half the attacking force.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'' p. 121; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 69.</ref>\nWith the Romans re-supplied and his attack-force decimated (c.2000 casualties) Mithridates decided to retreat. During the preparations for the retreat a panic broke out among his troops, Lucullus became aware of what was happening, mustered his army, and attacked Mithridates' camp at this point the Pontic army broke and disintegrated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'' pp 121-122; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 69.</ref>\n\nAfter the Battle of Cabira, Mithridates fled Pontus, he went to Armenia seeking his son-in-law king Tigranes' support. Joined by Lucullus at Nicomedia in 73 BC, Cotta was assigned the task of securing Lucullus' rear by taking Heraclea Pontica, which Mithridates had reinforced with 4,000 troops.<ref>Holmes, T. Rice, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I'', 1923, pg. 184</ref>  After reducing the Pontic coast, Cotta began besieging Heraclea itself, which took him two years to complete, sacking the city in 71 BC.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pgs. 110, 116 & 122</ref>  During this time he was forced to dismiss one of his [[quaestor]]s, Publius Oppius, charging him with bribery and conspiracy.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 110</ref> Lucullus himself consolidated Roman control over Pontus. First returning to the siege of Amisus.\n\n===Amisus===\nWith Mithridates out of his reach Lucullus set about consolidating his hold on Pontus. Amisus, an important Greek city in Pontus, was still holding out against [[Lucius Licinius Murena|Murena]] whom Lucullus had put in charge of the siege. Mithridates had sent the Greek Callimachus, a master of siege warfare, to Amisus to help with its defence. Callimachus created a number of mechanical defensive devices which gave the Romans a lot of hardships. Lucullus took over from Murena and proved his tactical genius once again by launching an attack at precisely the right time (when Callimachus let his defenders take a rest) and took Amisus, but not without regret; his soldiers ransacked the city and turned it into a ruin. Lucullus, a great admirer of Greek culture, lamented that Sulla had been blessed because he was able to save Athens, while the gods had ordained the faith of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], the destroyer of [[Corinth]], for him.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 72; Keaveny, ''Sulla, the Last Republican'', p.124.</ref>\n\n===Sinope===\nAfter Amisus Lucullus besieged Sinope, Pontus' main port city, which was also holding out against the Romans. There was significant resistance; the garrison was doing well in defending the coastal city on water as well as land. Lucullus kept up the pressure and finally the defenders gave up, they burned their heavier ships while escaping on lighter vessels. Lucullus granted the city its freedom because the real resistance had not come from the Sinopians themselves but from Cilician troops Mithridates had garrisoned there.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' pp 73-74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 13; Orosius, Historiae Adversus Paganos, VI 3.2-3.3.</ref>\n\nWhile Lucullus stayed in the East, Cotta returned to [[Rome]] in 70 BC, where he at first was widely acclaimed for his victory at Heraclea.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 127</ref>  However, around 67 BC he was accused of appropriation of war booty by Gaius Papirius Carbo.

Lucullus, busy mopping up resistance in Pontus and [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia Minor]] (also part of Mithridates's former dominions), sent his brother-in-law [[Appius Claudius Pulcher]] as an emissary to the Armenian king demanding he hand over Mithridates. Since handing over his son-in-law would make him look like nothing more than a puppet of Rome Tigranes had no other choice than to refuse and prepare for war.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 123-125; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 69 BC Lucullus marched his army from Cappadocia across the Euphrates into Greater Armenia (the Armenian Empire's heartland) and the Roman-Armenian War began.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', p. 126; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref>\n\nTigranes sent one of his nobles, Mithrobarzanes, with 2,000-3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 127-128; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', pp 83-84; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', XII.84.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Tigranocerta===\n{{main|Battle of Tigranocerta}}\n[[File:Armenian Empire.png|thumb|305px|[[Tigranes the Great]]'s empire c. 80 BC.]]\nLucullus began a siege of the new Armenian imperial capital of [[Tigranocerta]] in the Arzenene district. Tigranes, with his main host, returned from mopping up a Seleucid rebellion in Syria, and sought battle with the Romans. Lucullus' army annihilated the Armenian host, despite odds of about more than two to one against him. This was the famous battle of [[Battle of Tigranocerta|Tigranocerta]]. It was fought on the same (pre-Julian) calendar date as the Roman disaster at Arausio 36 years earlier, the day before the Nones of October according to the reckoning of the time (or October 6),<ref>Plutarch ''Camillus'' 19.11, ''Lucullus'' 27.8-9</ref> which is Julian October 16, 69 BC.<ref>See [[Roman calendar]], sub-heading Conversion of pre-Julian dates)</ref> Tigranes then retired to the northern regions of his kingdom to gather another army and defend his hereditary capital of Artaxata.  Meanwhile, Lucullus moved off south-eastwards to the kingdom of the Kurds ([[Corduene|Korduene]]) on the frontiers of the [[Armenia]]n and [[Parthia]]n empires. During the winter of 69-68 BC both sides opened negotiations with the Parthian king, Arsaces XVI, who was presently defending himself against a major onslaught from his rival [[Phraates III]] coming from [[Bactria]] and the far east.\n\n===Battle of Artaxata===\n{{main|Battle of Artaxata}}\nIn the summer of 68 BC Lucullus marched against Tigranes and crossed the Anti-Taurus range heading for the old Armenian capital Artaxata. Once again Tigranes was provoked to attack and in a major battle at the Aratsani River Lucullus defeated the Armenian army. Soon he left this campaign and when winter came on early in the Armenian tablelands, his troops mutinied, refusing to go further, and he was forced to withdraw southwards back into Arzenene. From there he proceeded back down through Korduene into old [[Assyria]] (Northern [[Mesopotamia]]) and in the late autumn and early winter besieged [[Nisibis]], the main [[Armenia]]n fortress city and treasury in Northern Mesopotamia.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', pp 101-104.</ref>\n\n===Nisibis===\nThe garrison at Nisibis was under the command of Tigranes' brother Gouras and the Greek defence expert Callimachus. At first Lucullus besieged the city to no avail. But in the winter of 68/67 BC, during a terrible storm, Lucullus launched a surprise attack and captured the city and its treasury. It made no difference, Mithridates and Tigranes stuck to their strategy and refused to march against Lucullus; Tigranes was in the process of taking back southern Armenia and Mithridates invaded Pontus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 139; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', pp 104-105; Eutropius, ''Breviarium'', 6.9.1.</ref>\n\n==Mithridates return to Pontus==\n{{main|Battle of Zela (67 BC)}}\nIn the spring of 67 BC, while Lucullus was laying siege to Nisibis, Mithridates suddenly returned to Pontus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p.140.</ref> The Romans had not expected Mithridates to strike at them in Pontus and he caught several small Roman detachments unaware. The [[Legatus|legate]] Gaius Valerius Triarius who was nearby bringing two legions to reinforce Lucullus took over command of all Roman forces in Pontus. After several skirmishes and small battles, a major battle took place on a plain near Zela ([[Battle of Zela (67 BC)|the Battle of Zela]]); the Romans were defeated, leaving 7,000 dead, including 24 [[tribune]]s and 150 [[centurion]]s. As a result, Mithridates was back in control of Pontus.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, ''the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', p.108; Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 140-142; Mayor, p. 311; Appian, ''Mithridatica'', 89; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 36.12.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter of 68-67 BC, at Nisibis, Lucullus\u2019 authority over his army was seriously undermined by the efforts of his young brother-in-law [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], apparently acting in the interests and pay of [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]], who was eager to succeed Lucullus in the eastern command. Lucullus was able to persuade his army to march back to Asia Minor to protect Roman interests there, but they refused to march against Mithridates. They were tired of constant campaigning for little profit. They threw their purses at Lucullus\u2019 feet and accused him that he was the only one making a personal profit of this war and told him to continue it on his own.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 35.</ref> Since his army refused to campaign against Mithridates Lucullus withdrew to [[Galatia]] leaving Mithridates to consolidate his power and rebuild his army in Pontus. In 66 BC, the senate sent Pompey (who had been lobbying for the command against Mithridates) to succeed Lucullus. The lull allowed Mithridates and Tigranes to retake part of their respective kingdoms.\n\n==Pompey in command==\nEarly in 66 the tribune [[Gaius Manilius]] proposed that Pompey should assume supreme command of the war against Mithridates and Tigranes. He should take control from the provincial governors in Asia Minor, have the power to appoint legates himself and the authority to make war and peace and to conclude treaties on his own discretion. The law, the [[Lex Manilia]], was approved by the Senate and the People and Pompey officially took command of the war in the east.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 75; Cicero, Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 36.43.2.</ref>\n\nOn the approach of Pompey, Mithridates retreated into the centre of his kingdom trying to stretch and cut off the Roman supply lines but this strategy did not work (Pompey excelled at logistics). Eventually Pompey cornered and defeated the king at the river Lycus (see: [[Battle of the Lycus|battle of Lycus]]). As Tigranes II of Armenia, his son-in-law, refused to receive him into his dominions ([[Greater Armenia]]), Mithridates fled to [[Colchis]], and hence made his way to his own dominions in the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. Pompey marched against Tigranes, whose kingdom and authority were now severely weakened. Tigranes then sued for peace and met with Pompey to plead a cessation of hostilities. The Armenian Kingdom became an allied client state of Rome. From Armenia, Pompey marched north against the Caucasian tribes and kingdoms who still supported Mithridates.\n\n{{further|Pompey's Georgian campaign}}\nIn 65 BC, Pompey had set out in pursuit of Mithridates, meeting opposition from the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanians]] who tried to overrun his camps and the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] whom he defeated at the [[battle of the Pelorus]]. After defeating the Albanians and Iberians he advanced into [[Colchis]] as far as [[Phasis (town)|Phasis]], where he met up with Servilius, the admiral of his Euxine fleet. From Phasis, Pompey marched east again for he had heard the Iberians were gathering their army again, he caught them at the river Abas where he decisively defeated them (see: [[Battle of the Abas|battle of Abas]]).\n\n===Complete Roman victory===\n\nAfter his defeat by Pompey in 65 BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army from Colchis to Crimea and attempted to raise yet another army to take on the Romans but failed to do so. In 63 BC, he withdrew to the citadel in [[Panticapaeum]]. His eldest son, [[Machares]], now king of [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], whose kingdom had been reorganized by the Romans, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares murdered and took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom, intent on retaking Pontus from the Romans. His younger son, [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces II]], backed by a disgruntled and war weary populace, led a rebellion against his father. This betrayal, after the decisive defeat in battle, hurt Mithridates more than any other and seeing his loss of authority he attempted suicide by poison. The attempt failed as he had [[Mithridatism|gained immunity to various poisons]] from taking tiny doses of all available poisons throughout his life to guard against assassination.<ref name=rome-leglay>A History of Rome, LeGlay, et al. 100</ref> According to [[Appian]]'s ''Roman History'', he then ordered his Gallic bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword: Mithridates' body was buried in either [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] or [[Amaseia]], on the orders of Pompey.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pontos.dk/publications/books/bss-9-files/bss-9-07-hojte-2 | title=The Death and Burial of Mithridates VI | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Hojte, Jakob Munk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Ancient sources===\n* ''FHG'' = [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig M\u00fcller|Karl M\u00fcller]] (ed.)

Both sides were joined by a great number of allies dragging the entire east of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and large parts of Asia ([[Asia Minor]], [[Greater Armenia]], Northern [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]) into the war. The conflict ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic Kingdom]], ending the [[Seleucid Empire]], and also resulting in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] becoming an allied [[client state]] of Rome.\n\n==Background==\nIn 120 BC, [[Mithridates V]], the king of Pontus was poisoned by persons unknown.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.68</ref> The conspirators were probably working for his wife [[Laodice IV|Laodice]].<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 6</ref> In his will Mithridates V left the kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice, Mithridates VI and [[Mithridates Chrestus]]. Both of her sons were underage and Laodice retained all power as regent.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.69</ref> Laodice in her regency favored her second son (Chrestus was probably more pliable). During her regency 120\u2013116 BC (perhaps even 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped the court of his mother and went into hiding.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.69</ref> He returned between 116\u2013113 BC and able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontic throne, thus becoming the sole ruler of Pontus.<ref>Mayor, ''The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome\u2019s deadliest enemy'' p.394</ref>\n\nMithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the east of Asia Minor and the [[Black Sea]] region. He first subjugated [[Colchis]], a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the [[Pontic steppe]] with the [[Scythian]] King [[Palacus]]. The most important cities and people of the [[Crimea]], the [[Tauric Chersonesus]] and the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] readily surrendered their independence in return for Mithridates' protection against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. The Scythians and their allies the [[Rhoxolanoi]] suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] and accepted Mithridates as their overlord.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 13-18</ref>\n\nThe young king then turned his attention to Asia Minor, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition [[Paphlagonia]] and [[Galatia]] with King [[Nicomedes III of Bithynia]]. Yet it soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of [[Kingdom of Cappadocia|Cappadocia]], and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95\u201392 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war. By this time Mithridates had resolved to expel the Romans from Asia.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 19-24</ref>\n\nThe next ruler of [[Bithynia]], [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]], was a [[Puppet ruler|figurehead]] manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were few Roman troops available. The Romans therefore mustered a great number of Asian levies and combined with Nicomedes' army they invade Mithridates' kingdom in 89 BC. Mithridates won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious forces were welcomed throughout Asia Minor. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and [[Italic peoples|Italian]] settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. 80,000 people are said to have perished in this massacre. The episode is known as the [[Asiatic Vespers]].<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 25-47</ref>\n\nThe Romans responded by organising a large invasion force (this time sending their own legions) to defeat him and remove him from power. The [[First Mithridatic War]], fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] force Mithridates out of Greece proper. After being victorious in several battles Sulla, being declared an outlaw by his political opponents in Rome, hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sulla returned to Italy [[Lucius Licinius Murena]] was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to restore his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the [[Second Mithridatic War]] from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates defeated Murena's two green legions at the [[Battle of Halys]] in 82 BC before peace was again declared by treaty.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 57-100</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nThe period between the Second and Third wars of Rome and the Pontic Kingdom (81\u201375 BC) is discussed under the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. There it can be seen how the long piracy wars were a development out of the [[First Mithridatic War]] and especially of the alliance between [[Mithridates VI]] and [[Sertorius]], which in joining those two threats into a unity much larger than its parts had the serious potential of overturning Roman power. The immediate cause of the Third War was the bequest to Rome by King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia of his kingdom upon his death (74 BC). Mithridates, who had been rebuilding his forces, launched an invasion of Bithynia.<ref>Philip Matyzak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 101-102</ref>\n\n== Forces and initial deployments, 74\u201373 BC ==\nHaving launched an attack at the same time as a revolt by [[Sertorius]] swept through the Spanish provinces, Mithridates was initially virtually unopposed. The Senate responded by sending the consuls [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Cotta (consul 74 BC)|Marcus Aurelius Cotta]] to deal with the Pontic threat. The only other possible general for such an important command, [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]], was in [[Hispania]] to help [[Metellus Pius]] crush the revolt led by Sertorius. Lucullus was sent to govern [[Cilicia]] and Cotta to [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia]].<ref>Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, ''A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography'', 1860, pg. 226</ref> According to Appian and Plutarch Lucullus had 30,000 infantry and 1,600-2,500 cavalry while Mithridates was rumoured to have as many as 300,000 men in his force.<ref>Appian, ''Mithridatica'', XI.72; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 8.</ref>\n\nThe original plan was that Cotta should tie down Mithridates' fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta was therefore ordered to station his fleet at [[Chalcedon]], while Lucullus marched through [[Phrygia]] with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked and defeated Cotta at the [[Battle of Chalcedon (74 BC)|battle of Chalcedon]], and forced him to flee behind the walls of Chalcedon. Sixty-four Roman ships had been captured or burnt, and Cotta had lost three thousand men.<ref>Holmes, T. Rice, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I'', 1923, pg. 180</ref><ref>Appian ''Mithridates''. 71; Plutarch.

Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 99</ref>\n\n==Mithridates\u2019 defeat in western Asia, 73-72 BC==\nHaving made his way to [[Nicomedia]], Cotta watched in frustration as Mithridates marched on taking [[Nicaea]], [[Lampsacus]], [[Nicomedia]] and Apameia, all major cities in the region. Only nearby [[Cyzicus]] held to the Roman cause, probably because many of its citizens (serving in Cotta's army as [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]]) had died fighting against Mithridates at Chalcedon. The Pontic army marched on Cyzicus and began a siege.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's indomitable Enemy'', pp 106-113; Plutarch ''Life of Lucullus'', 8.</ref>\n\nLucullus was camped somewhere along the [[Sakarya River|Sangarius river]] in Bithynia when he received news of Cotta's defeat. His soldiers urged him to leave Cotta to his own folly and march on undefended Pontus with its rich potential for loot. Lucullus ignored them and headed toward Chalcedon. [[Marcus Marius (quaestor)|Marcus Marius]], a Roman rebel cooperating with Mithridates, blocked and confronted him. They faced off at Otroea near Nicaea (present-day [[Iznik]]).<ref>Keaveney, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref> Although Lucullus commanded 30,000 infantry and 2,500 horse, he was daunted by the size of the opposing army and reluctant to engage. The arrival of an omen, as reported by Plutarch, was thus fortuitous:<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html#8.5 8.]</ref> \n\n{{cquote|But presently, as they were on the point of joining battle, with no apparent change of weather, but all on a sudden, the sky burst asunder, and a huge, flame-like body was seen to fall between the two armies. In shape, it was most like a wine-jar ''([[pithos]])'', and in colour, like molten silver. Both sides were astonished at the sight, and separated. This marvel, as they say, occurred in [[Phrygia]], at a place called [[Otryae]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html#8.5 8.6\u20137,] [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation, Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]].</ref>}}\n\nNo battle occurred. For Marius, delay posed a logistical problem. He had only a few days of supplies for his troops. Lucullus learned of the shortage through prisoner interrogations and decided to wait him out. Marius was forced to move on without the fight he had sought.\n\n===The Siege of Cyzicus===\n{{main|Siege of Cyzicus|Battle of the Rhyndacus (73 BC)}}\nWhile Mithridates was besieging Cyzicus Lucullus and his army arrived; the Romans, with the help of some turncoats, were able to establish a counter-siege, trapping Mithridates' army on the Cyzicus [[peninsula]]. During the siege Mithridates sent his cavalry, with the sick and the wounded away, but they were ambushed and slaughtered at the river Rhyndacus. In the middle of a snowstorm, Lucullus met these forces with ten cohorts and attacked them in mid-crossing on both sides of the river. [[Plutarch]] and [[Appian]] record 15,000 men and 6,000 horses as being captured during the battle.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 60; Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', p. 112.</ref> The disaster at the Rhyndacus combined with the famine and a plague which had struck his main army forced Mithridates to completely abandoned his position, sailing north while his army marched overland. Lucullus pursued the army and defeated them at the confluence of the [[Aesepus River|Aesepus]] and [[Granicus River]]s slaughtering many (20,000 were killed while crossing the river Granicus). Eventually, of the 300,000 who had set out for Bithynia only 20,000 effective troops remained. The siege of Cyzicus and the subsequent retreat could be considered an unmitigated disaster.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 112-113.</ref>\n\n===The naval campaign===\nMarcus Marius, having survived the Cyzicus campaign, had taken to the sea. Along with Mithridates's admirals Alexandros the Paphlagonian and Dionysios Eunuchos (\"the [[Eunuch]]\"), he was placed in joint command of 50 ships and 10,000 handpicked men, among them, in the words of [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], \"the flower of the Roman emigrants.\"<ref>[[Theodor Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', vol. 4, p. 329.</ref> Their intention seems to have been to sail east into the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], but Lucullus mounted an attack against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of [[Tenedos]] and the mainland harbor of the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]]. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between [[Lemnos]] and [[Scyros]]; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea.<ref>Keaveney, ''Lucullus'', p. 85.</ref> Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet provided by Mithradates and additional transport vessels. Dionysios committed suicide, but Alexandros was captured and held for display in Lucullus's anticipated [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. Among the dead were a number of men who had been on [[Proscription#Proscription of 82 BC|Sulla's proscription lists]]. Marius at first escaped, possibly from a sinking ship, since he was later found ashore taking refuge in a cave.<ref>[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] 6.2.21\u201322.</ref>\n\nLike Sertorius himself, Marius at some point had lost an eye; when Lucullus gave the order to track down enemy survivors, he specified that no one-eyed men should be killed, so that he could personally oversee the renegade's death: \"Lucullus wished Marius to die under the most shameful insults.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 12.5.</ref> Orosius reports that he atoned for his rebellious spirit with penalties he earned.<ref>Orosius 6.2.2.</ref>\n\n==Lucullus invades Pontus, 71-69 BC==\nIn 72 BC Lucullus marched his army through [[Galatia]] and into Pontus. The [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]] were only too happy to supply the Romans because they detested Mithridates and were keen to see the Roman legions pass through their country without being plundered.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy''; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 14.</ref> Once Lucullus was in the Pontic heartland and he let his troops plunder the rich and fertile area. Mithridates could do nothing to stop the despoiling of his lands for he had to rebuild his army. He eventually assembled 40,000 men (4,000 cavalry) near Cabira and waited for Lucullus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 119; Appian, ''Mithridatica'', 78.</ref>\n\n===Cabira===\n{{main|Battle of Cabira}}\nAfter careful manoeuvering Lucullus occupied an old fortress on the heights overlooking Cabira. This was a secure and very defensible position, but its location meant the Romans were cut off from their recent conquests in Pontus and their supply lines now had to come north from [[Cappadocia]], a Roman ally to the south of Pontus. Since Mithridates dominated the countryside, Lucullus had to send out heavily armed convoys to get supplies. A supply convoy, escorted by no less than ten cohorts of infantry (c.3,000-5,000 men), under the command of the legate Sornatius was attacked by the Pontic cavalry. The Roman infantry stood their ground and held off the attack inflicting terrible losses on the Pontic horsemen. When a second supply convoy, also heavily armed, under the command of Marcus Fabius Hadrianus made for Lucullus' camp Mithridates decided to use a [[combined arms]] (infantry and cavalry) force. Some 4,000 cavalry and infantry fell upon the convoy, unfortunately, the Romans realized the narrow valley at the scene limited the effectiveness of their opponents' cavalry and they [[Counterattack|counter-attacked]] wiping out half the attacking force.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'' p. 121; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 69.</ref>\nWith the Romans re-supplied and his attack-force decimated (c.2000 casualties) Mithridates decided to retreat. During the preparations for the retreat a panic broke out among his troops, Lucullus became aware of what was happening, mustered his army, and attacked Mithridates' camp at this point the Pontic army broke and disintegrated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy'' pp 121-122; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 69.</ref> \n\nAfter the Battle of Cabira, Mithridates fled Pontus, he went to Armenia seeking his son-in-law king Tigranes' support. Joined by Lucullus at Nicomedia in 73 BC, Cotta was assigned the task of securing Lucullus' rear by taking Heraclea Pontica, which Mithridates had reinforced with 4,000 troops.<ref>Holmes, T. Rice, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I'', 1923, pg. 184</ref>  After reducing the Pontic coast, Cotta began besieging Heraclea itself, which took him two years to complete, sacking the city in 71 BC.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pgs. 110, 116 & 122</ref>  During this time he was forced to dismiss one of his [[quaestor]]s, Publius Oppius, charging him with bribery and conspiracy.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 110</ref> Lucullus himself consolidated Roman control over Pontus. First returning to the siege of Amisus.\n\n===Amisus===\nWith Mithridates out of his reach Lucullus set about consolidating his hold on Pontus. Amisus, an important Greek city in Pontus, was still holding out against [[Lucius Licinius Murena|Murena]] whom Lucullus had put in charge of the siege. Mithridates had sent the Greek Callimachus, a master of siege warfare, to Amisus to help with its defence. Callimachus created a number of mechanical defensive devices which gave the Romans a lot of hardships. Lucullus took over from Murena and proved his tactical genius once again by launching an attack at precisely the right time (when Callimachus let his defenders take a rest) and took Amisus, but not without regret; his soldiers ransacked the city and turned it into a ruin. Lucullus, a great admirer of Greek culture, lamented that Sulla had been blessed because he was able to save Athens, while the gods had ordained the faith of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], the destroyer of [[Corinth]], for him.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'' p. 72; Keaveny, ''Sulla, the Last Republican'', p.124.</ref>\n\n===Sinope===\nAfter Amisus Lucullus besieged Sinope, Pontus' main port city, which was also holding out against the Romans. There was significant resistance; the garrison was doing well in defending the coastal city on water as well as land. Lucullus kept up the pressure and finally the defenders gave up, they burned their heavier ships while escaping on lighter vessels. Lucullus granted the city its freedom because the real resistance had not come from the Sinopians themselves but from Cilician troops Mithridates had garrisoned there.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus: the Life and Campaings of a Roman Conqueror'' pp 73-74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 13; Orosius, Historiae Adversus Paganos, VI 3.2-3.3.</ref>\n\nWhile Lucullus stayed in the East, Cotta returned to [[Rome]] in 70 BC, where he at first was widely acclaimed for his victory at Heraclea.<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 127</ref>  However, around 67 BC he was accused of appropriation of war booty by Gaius Papirius Carbo. He was convicted of the offence and expelled from the [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Senate]].<ref>T. Robert S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pgs. 127 & 144</ref>\n\n==The First Roman-Armenian War, 69-67 BC==\nAfter the [[Battle of Cabira]] Mithridates fled to his father-in-law [[Tigranes II]] the king of the [[Greater Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian Empire]]. Lucullus, busy mopping up resistance in Pontus and [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia Minor]] (also part of Mithridates's former dominions), sent his brother-in-law [[Appius Claudius Pulcher]] as an emissary to the Armenian king demanding he hand over Mithridates. Since handing over his son-in-law would make him look like nothing more than a puppet of Rome Tigranes had no other choice than to refuse and prepare for war.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 123-125; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 69 BC Lucullus marched his army from Cappadocia across the Euphrates into Greater Armenia (the Armenian Empire's heartland) and the Roman-Armenian War began.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', p. 126; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', p. 77.</ref> \n\nTigranes sent one of his nobles, Mithrobarzanes, with 2,000-3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 127-128; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', pp 83-84; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', XII.84.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Tigranocerta===\n{{main|Battle of Tigranocerta}}\n[[File:Armenian Empire.png|thumb|305px|[[Tigranes the Great]]'s empire c. 80 BC.]]\nLucullus began a siege of the new Armenian imperial capital of [[Tigranocerta]] in the Arzenene district. Tigranes, with his main host, returned from mopping up a Seleucid rebellion in Syria, and sought battle with the Romans. Lucullus' army annihilated the Armenian host, despite odds of about more than two to one against him. This was the famous battle of [[Battle of Tigranocerta|Tigranocerta]]. It was fought on the same (pre-Julian) calendar date as the Roman disaster at Arausio 36 years earlier, the day before the Nones of October according to the reckoning of the time (or October 6),<ref>Plutarch ''Camillus'' 19.11, ''Lucullus'' 27.8-9</ref> which is Julian October 16, 69 BC.<ref>See [[Roman calendar]], sub-heading Conversion of pre-Julian dates)</ref> Tigranes then retired to the northern regions of his kingdom to gather another army and defend his hereditary capital of Artaxata.  Meanwhile, Lucullus moved off south-eastwards to the kingdom of the Kurds ([[Corduene|Korduene]]) on the frontiers of the [[Armenia]]n and [[Parthia]]n empires. During the winter of 69-68 BC both sides opened negotiations with the Parthian king, Arsaces XVI, who was presently defending himself against a major onslaught from his rival [[Phraates III]] coming from [[Bactria]] and the far east.\n\n===Battle of Artaxata===\n{{main|Battle of Artaxata}}\nIn the summer of 68 BC Lucullus marched against Tigranes and crossed the Anti-Taurus range heading for the old Armenian capital Artaxata. Once again Tigranes was provoked to attack and in a major battle at the Aratsani River Lucullus defeated the Armenian army. Soon he left this campaign and when winter came on early in the Armenian tablelands, his troops mutinied, refusing to go further, and he was forced to withdraw southwards back into Arzenene. From there he proceeded back down through Korduene into old [[Assyria]] (Northern [[Mesopotamia]]) and in the late autumn and early winter besieged [[Nisibis]], the main [[Armenia]]n fortress city and treasury in Northern Mesopotamia.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', pp 101-104.</ref>\n\n===Nisibis===\nThe garrison at Nisibis was under the command of Tigranes' brother Gouras and the Greek defence expert Callimachus. At first Lucullus besieged the city to no avail. But in the winter of 68/67 BC, during a terrible storm, Lucullus launched a surprise attack and captured the city and its treasury. It made no difference, Mithridates and Tigranes stuck to their strategy and refused to march against Lucullus; Tigranes was in the process of taking back southern Armenia and Mithridates invaded Pontus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 139; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', pp 104-105; Eutropius, ''Breviarium'', 6.9.1.</ref>\n\n==Mithridates return to Pontus==\n{{main|Battle of Zela (67 BC)}}\nIn the spring of 67 BC, while Lucullus was laying siege to Nisibis, Mithridates suddenly returned to Pontus.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p.140.</ref> The Romans had not expected Mithridates to strike at them in Pontus and he caught several small Roman detachments unaware. The [[Legatus|legate]] Gaius Valerius Triarius who was nearby bringing two legions to reinforce Lucullus took over command of all Roman forces in Pontus. After several skirmishes and small battles, a major battle took place on a plain near Zela ([[Battle of Zela (67 BC)|the Battle of Zela]]); the Romans were defeated, leaving 7,000 dead, including 24 [[tribune]]s and 150 [[centurion]]s. As a result, Mithridates was back in control of Pontus.<ref>Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, ''the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', p.108; Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', pp 140-142; Mayor, p. 311; Appian, ''Mithridatica'', 89; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 36.12.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter of 68-67 BC, at Nisibis, Lucullus\u2019 authority over his army was seriously undermined by the efforts of his young brother-in-law [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], apparently acting in the interests and pay of [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]], who was eager to succeed Lucullus in the eastern command. Lucullus was able to persuade his army to march back to Asia Minor to protect Roman interests there, but they refused to march against Mithridates. They were tired of constant campaigning for little profit. They threw their purses at Lucullus\u2019 feet and accused him that he was the only one making a personal profit of this war and told him to continue it on his own.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', 35.</ref> Since his army refused to campaign against Mithridates Lucullus withdrew to [[Galatia]] leaving Mithridates to consolidate his power and rebuild his army in Pontus. In 66 BC, the senate sent Pompey (who had been lobbying for the command against Mithridates) to succeed Lucullus. The lull allowed Mithridates and Tigranes to retake part of their respective kingdoms.\n\n==Pompey in command==\nEarly in 66 the tribune [[Gaius Manilius]] proposed that Pompey should assume supreme command of the war against Mithridates and Tigranes. He should take control from the provincial governors in Asia Minor, have the power to appoint legates himself and the authority to make war and peace and to conclude treaties on his own discretion. The law, the [[Lex Manilia]], was approved by the Senate and the People and Pompey officially took command of the war in the east.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 75; Cicero, Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 36.43.2.</ref>\n\nOn the approach of Pompey, Mithridates retreated into the centre of his kingdom trying to stretch and cut off the Roman supply lines but this strategy did not work (Pompey excelled at logistics). Eventually Pompey cornered and defeated the king at the river Lycus (see: [[Battle of the Lycus|battle of Lycus]]). As Tigranes II of Armenia, his son-in-law, refused to receive him into his dominions ([[Greater Armenia]]), Mithridates fled to [[Colchis]], and hence made his way to his own dominions in the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. Pompey marched against Tigranes, whose kingdom and authority were now severely weakened. Tigranes then sued for peace and met with Pompey to plead a cessation of hostilities. The Armenian Kingdom became an allied client state of Rome. From Armenia, Pompey marched north against the Caucasian tribes and kingdoms who still supported Mithridates.\n\n{{further|Pompey's Georgian campaign}}\nIn 65 BC, Pompey had set out in pursuit of Mithridates, meeting opposition from the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanians]] who tried to overrun his camps and the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] whom he defeated at the [[battle of the Pelorus]]. After defeating the Albanians and Iberians he advanced into [[Colchis]] as far as [[Phasis (town)|Phasis]], where he met up with Servilius, the admiral of his Euxine fleet. From Phasis, Pompey marched east again for he had heard the Iberians were gathering their army again, he caught them at the river Abas where he decisively defeated them (see: [[Battle of the Abas|battle of Abas]]).\n\n===Complete Roman victory===\n\nAfter his defeat by Pompey in 65 BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army from Colchis to Crimea and attempted to raise yet another army to take on the Romans but failed to do so. In 63 BC, he withdrew to the citadel in [[Panticapaeum]]. His eldest son, [[Machares]], now king of [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], whose kingdom had been reorganized by the Romans, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares murdered and took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom, intent on retaking Pontus from the Romans. His younger son, [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces II]], backed by a disgruntled and war weary populace, led a rebellion against his father. This betrayal, after the decisive defeat in battle, hurt Mithridates more than any other and seeing his loss of authority he attempted suicide by poison. The attempt failed as he had [[Mithridatism|gained immunity to various poisons]] from taking tiny doses of all available poisons throughout his life to guard against assassination.<ref name=rome-leglay>A History of Rome, LeGlay, et al. 100</ref> According to [[Appian]]'s ''Roman History'', he then ordered his Gallic bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword: Mithridates' body was buried in either [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] or [[Amaseia]], on the orders of Pompey.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pontos.dk/publications/books/bss-9-files/bss-9-07-hojte-2 | title=The Death and Burial of Mithridates VI | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Hojte, Jakob Munk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Ancient sources===\n* ''FHG'' = [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig M\u00fcller|Karl M\u00fcller]] (ed.)
