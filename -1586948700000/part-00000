He is active in the frenchcore scene, but is known for branching out and collaborating with artists in other styles of [[hard dance]], such as [[hardstyle]], [[mainstream hardcore]] and uptempo hardcore.

At the age of 9, he was exposed to the world of music production when he saw a copy of [[FL Studio]] for the first time. Although he didn't have an interest in producing music before, seeing the software sparked something inside Sefa. He asked his mother for some music production software for his 10th birthday and put his full focus towards figuring out how to make music. During this time, Sefa was more interested in producing hardstyle, inspired by artists such as [[Headhunterz]] and [[Noisecontrollers]]. In 2011, through a coincidence in his home town of [[Castricum]], Sefa's mother met Dr. Peacock, the most significant Dutch frenchcore artist at the time, and asked him to give Sefa some feedback. Dr. Peacock took an interest to Sefa and introduced him to the world of frenchcore music, which changed his artistic direction. After sending demos to Dr. Peacock every few months, Sefa eventually scored a label deal with Dr. Peacock's label, Peacock Records.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://edm.com/interviews/life-is-suffering-sefa-is-going-to-the-top|title=Life is Suffering & Sefa is Going To The Top|last=Mandel|first=Alan|website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> In 2017, Sefa was booked to perform at the yellow stage at [[Defqon.1]] for the first time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8n2u-VbZI|title= SEFA @ DEFQON.1 2017 (FULL SET) {{!}} YouTube|website=youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> At the same festival, he played the piano for the first edition of Peacock in Concert, Dr. Peacock's liveact.\n\n[[File:Sefa Harmony of Hardcore.jpg|thumb|left|Sefa live on stage at Harmony of Hardcore 2018]]\n\nAfter releasing music on Peacock Records for several years, 2018 saw the release of Sefa's first album \"Leven is Lijden\" (meaning \"Life is Suffering\" in Dutch). The album was very successful, launching Sefa's career beyond the frenchcore scene and into the mainstream of hard dance music. In May 2018, Sefa performed at Harmony of Hardcore live with a piano. In this set, Sefa premiered several tracks, including \"Nothing Like The Oldschool\" with D-Sturb, \"In De Hemel\" and \"God's Plan\" with Mr. Ivex.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIXRHtSLBic|title=SEFA @ HARMONY OF HARDCORE 2018 (LIVE WITH PIANO) {{!}} YouTube|website=youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>  The summer saw Sefa perform at the black stage at Defqon.1 as well as part of Peacock in Concert on the main stage of the festival (red stage).

He is active in the frenchcore scene, but is known for branching out and collaborating with artists in other styles of [[hard dance]], such as [[hardstyle]], [[mainstream hardcore]] and uptempo hardcore. Sefa is also known for performing live on the [[piano]] during his performances and for the [[classical music|classical]] influences in his music.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMS9W14ui0|title=Sefa - Combining a Love for Frenchcore & Classical Music {{!}} YouTube|website=youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nSefa was born in Alkmaar, The Netherlands on the 30th of June, 2000. At the age of 9, he was exposed to the world of music production when he saw a copy of [[FL Studio]] for the first time. Although he didn't have an interest in producing music before, seeing the software sparked something inside Sefa. He asked his mother for some music production software for his 10th birthday and put his full focus towards figuring out how to make music. During this time, Sefa was more interested in producing hardstyle, inspired by artists such as [[Headhunterz]] and [[Noisecontrollers]]. In 2011, through a coincidence in his home town of [[Castricum]], Sefa's mother met Dr. Peacock, the most significant Dutch frenchcore artist at the time, and asked him to give Sefa some feedback. Dr. Peacock took an interest to Sefa and introduced him to the world of frenchcore music, which changed his artistic direction. After sending demos to Dr. Peacock every few months, Sefa eventually scored a label deal with Dr. Peacock's label, Peacock Records.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://edm.com/interviews/life-is-suffering-sefa-is-going-to-the-top|title=Life is Suffering & Sefa is Going To The Top|last=Mandel|first=Alan|website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> In 2017, Sefa was booked to perform at the yellow stage at [[Defqon.1]] for the first time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8n2u-VbZI|title= SEFA @ DEFQON.1 2017 (FULL SET) {{!}} YouTube|website=youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> At the same festival, he played the piano for the first edition of Peacock in Concert, Dr. Peacock's liveact.\n\n[[File:Sefa Harmony of Hardcore.jpg|thumb|left|Sefa live on stage at Harmony of Hardcore 2018]]\n\nAfter releasing music on Peacock Records for several years, 2018 saw the release of Sefa's first album \"Leven is Lijden\" (meaning \"Life is Suffering\" in Dutch).
