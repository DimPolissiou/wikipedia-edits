Juveniles are a duller, browner version of the adult.\n\n''Ciconia'' storks are gregarious and colonial breeders, and pairs stay together for life. They typically build large stick nests in trees, although the maguari stork will nest on the ground and at least three species will construct their nests on human habitations.

They fly with the neck outstretched, like most other storks, but unlike [[heron]]s which retract their neck in flight.\n\nThe migratory species like the [[white stork]] and the [[black stork]] soar on broad wings and rely on thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight. Since thermals only form over land, these storks, like large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s, must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points, and many of these birds can be seen going through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and the [[Bosphorus]] on migration.\n\n==Species==\n===Extant species===\nThe genus contains seven extant species:<ref name=ioc>{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2019 | title=Storks, ibis, herons | work=World Bird List Version 9.1 | url=https://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/storks/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=2 April 2019 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Farming still dominated the area, although there is evidence in maps of a substantial cotton house on Cotton Lane, which later appears to become Withington Hall. Some historians dispute the cotton house as there is little record of it, and claim ''\"Cotton Lane\"'' comes from land in the area which was jointly held by the townships of Withington, [[Didsbury]] and [[Burnage]] (a relic of the [[Open field system|medieval open field system]]). This area was the old village centre however, although the only relic of its former importance is the small flower display on the corner of [[Wilmslow Road, Manchester|Wilmslow Road]] and Cotton Lane.\n\n===Victorian and later periods===\n[[File:St Paul&#039;s Church, Withington.jpg|thumb|[[St Paul's Church, Withington]]]]\n[[File:White Lion, Withington.jpg|thumb|The White Lion: Withington's growth in the Victorian era is evident in much of its architecture]]\nThe trade in Withington, and consequent traffic on Wilmslow Road, increased steadily as the city of Manchester flourished in the early 19th century. [[Toll road|Turnpike road]]s subsequently became increasingly unpopular, and were abolished completely in 1881. Wilmslow Road as a turnpike road would have been abolished as soon as 1861 had the Manchester to Wilmslow Turnpike Trust not agreed to build a new turnpike road to Northenden, named Palatine Road. Cheaper transport in and out of Manchester became an important factor in the growth of the area. In 1880 a tramway was built along Wilmslow Road and Palatine Road to the newly opened [[Withington and West Didsbury railway station]], run by the [[Midland Railway]]. The horse trams ran until 1 December 1902 when the first electric [[trams]] came into operation. The train service from Withington and West Didsbury railway station to [[Manchester Central railway station]] operated until Didsbury railway station closed in 1961.\n\nWithington's [[St Paul's Church, Withington|Parish Church of St Paul]] was built in 1841; the architects of St Paul's Church were Hayley & Brown and it was extended in 1864.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartwell |first1=Clare |last2=Hyde |first2=Matthew |last3=Pevsner |first3=Nikolaus |title=Lancashire: Manchester and the South-East |date=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300105834 |page=484 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fLJSTdnCgqUC&lpg=PA484&ots=plAUMqrFrT&dq=st%20pauls%20church%20withington%20Hayley%20%26%20Brown&pg=PA484#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Many other chapels and churches proliferated, including [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Roman Catholic]]. \n\nAs the population increased, the need for schools grew. A day school was held in a schoolroom underneath the Wesleyan chapel on Old Hall Lane, until the [[Church of England]] established a new church school with public donations next to its new parish church in 1844, St Paul's Primary School, on land donated by [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] [[Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton]].{{sfn|Sussex|Helm|1988|p=25}}\n\nWithington has also been home to many well known [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Sephardi Jews]]: synagogues opened in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nWithington also had a [[Huguenot]] population with family and commercial ties to Germany. Among them was the Souchay family, who lived at Withington House on Wilmslow Road (the present site of the telephone exchange at Old Broadway). Charles (or Carl) Souchay and his wife Adelaide (or Adelheid) were benefactors of St Paul's church school, and the first wedding to take place at St Paul's was the marriage of the eldest Souchay daughter in 1850. The Souchays were related to C\u00e9cile Mendelssohn Bartholdy, wife of the German composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. In the 1840s, Mendelssohn made several visits to Britain, and stayed on occasion with friends in Withington.

Since the district was absorbed into the City of Manchester in 1904, the three city [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Didsbury, Fallowfield, and Withington took on their own identities and are now seen as distinct areas.  The Conservative Party could once regard this area as a heartland for them, with its largely middle class population and relatively suburban image. The 'flight of the middle classes' to rural Cheshire, however, led to many of Withington's larger homes being sold off for student flats. This resulted in a changing socio-economic structure that would ultimately favour Labour and more recently, for a time, the Liberal-Democrats.\n\nIn the 2011, 2012 and 2014 local government elections however the Liberal-Democrats lost every Council seat in Withington Constituency and in the City of Manchester as a whole that they contested, leaving Labour with 95 out of 96 Council seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/politics/local_elections/s/1492938_local-election-2012-dramatic-gains-for-labour-across-greater-manchester |title=Local election 2012: Dramatic gains for Labour across Greater Manchester |publisher=M.E.N.

Farming still dominated the area, although there is evidence in maps of a substantial cotton house on Cotton Lane, which later appears to become Withington Hall. Some historians dispute the cotton house as there is little record of it, and claim ''\"Cotton Lane\"'' comes from land in the area which was jointly held by the townships of Withington, [[Didsbury]] and [[Burnage]] (a relic of the [[Open field system|medieval open field system]]). This area was the old village centre however, although the only relic of its former importance is the small flower display on the corner of [[Wilmslow Road, Manchester|Wilmslow Road]] and Cotton Lane.\n\n===Victorian and later periods===\n[[File:St Paul&#039;s Church, Withington.jpg|thumb|[[St Paul's Church, Withington]]]]\n[[File:White Lion, Withington.jpg|thumb|The White Lion: Withington's growth in the Victorian era is evident in much of its architecture]]\nThe trade in Withington, and consequent traffic on Wilmslow Road, increased steadily as the city of Manchester flourished in the early 19th century. [[Toll road|Turnpike road]]s subsequently became increasingly unpopular, and were abolished completely in 1881. Wilmslow Road as a turnpike road would have been abolished as soon as 1861 had the Manchester to Wilmslow Turnpike Trust not agreed to build a new turnpike road to Northenden, named Palatine Road. Cheaper transport in and out of Manchester became an important factor in the growth of the area. In 1880 a tramway was built along Wilmslow Road and Palatine Road to the newly opened [[Withington and West Didsbury railway station]], run by the [[Midland Railway]]. The horse trams ran until 1 December 1902 when the first electric [[trams]] came into operation. The train service from Withington and West Didsbury railway station to [[Manchester Central railway station]] operated until Didsbury railway station closed in 1961.\n\nWithington's [[St Paul's Church, Withington|Parish Church of St Paul]] was built in 1841; the architects of St Paul's Church were Hayley & Brown and it was extended in 1864.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartwell |first1=Clare |last2=Hyde |first2=Matthew |last3=Pevsner |first3=Nikolaus |title=Lancashire: Manchester and the South-East |date=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300105834 |page=484 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fLJSTdnCgqUC&lpg=PA484&ots=plAUMqrFrT&dq=st%20pauls%20church%20withington%20Hayley%20%26%20Brown&pg=PA484#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Many other chapels and churches proliferated, including [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Roman Catholic]]. \n\nAs the population increased, the need for schools grew. A day school was held in a schoolroom underneath the Wesleyan chapel on Old Hall Lane, until the [[Church of England]] established a new church school with public donations next to its new parish church in 1844, St Paul's Primary School, on land donated by [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] [[Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton]].{{sfn|Sussex|Helm|1988|p=25}}\n\nWithington has also been home to many well known [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Sephardi Jews]]: synagogues opened in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nWithington also had a [[Huguenot]] population with family and commercial ties to Germany. Among them was the Souchay family, who lived at Withington House on Wilmslow Road (the present site of the telephone exchange at Old Broadway). Charles (or Carl) Souchay and his wife Adelaide (or Adelheid) were benefactors of St Paul's church school, and the first wedding to take place at St Paul's was the marriage of the eldest Souchay daughter in 1850. The Souchays were related to C\u00e9cile Mendelssohn Bartholdy, wife of the German composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. In the 1840s, Mendelssohn made several visits to Britain, and stayed on occasion with friends in Withington.

The Conservative Party could once regard this area as a heartland for them, with its largely middle class population and relatively suburban image. The 'flight of the middle classes' to rural Cheshire, however, led to many of Withington's larger homes being sold off for student flats. This resulted in a changing socio-economic structure that would ultimately favour Labour and more recently, for a time, the Liberal-Democrats.\n\nIn the 2011, 2012 and 2014 local government elections however the Liberal-Democrats lost every Council seat in Withington Constituency and in the City of Manchester as a whole that they contested, leaving Labour with 95 out of 96 Council seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/politics/local_elections/s/1492938_local-election-2012-dramatic-gains-for-labour-across-greater-manchester |title=Local election 2012: Dramatic gains for Labour across Greater Manchester |publisher=M.E.N.

It is the second largest church in Alcamo, after the basilica di Santa Maria Assunta,\n\n== History ==\nThe church's construction began in 1684, thanks to the savings made by the [[Jesuits]] who built it on a piece of land given by the [[Town Council]]; in exchange for it, they undertook to make several building improvements at their own expenses, in particular:\n\n* The addition of six steps to Porta Stella, through which people entered the walled town;\n* The fixing of the water piping which took the water of the spring outside the town walls to the fountain used as a drinking trough; they had to move it from [[piazza Ciullo]] and place it in the new site next to the main tower of the [[ditch]] (corresponding to the present via Mazzini). In this manner they diverted the way that animals crossed to water: it was necessary to do that because after the construction of the '''Church of Jesus''' their transit would have been obstructed. \n[[File:Chiesa_del_Collegio_dei_Gesuiti_(Alcamo)_071.jpg|left|thumb|The Jesuits' emblem represented in a marble inlay inside the Church.]]\nOn 7 June 1725 Father Vincenzo Monteleone from Alcamo, who was the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the Jesuits' College, was appointed as the procurator for the building of this Church which in that period reached only the height of 8 palms on the western side, opposite the town walls.\n\nOn 29 July 1764 they inaugurated the Church with a solemn ceremony; later they decorated it with [[stucco]]es and in 1767 completed its construction,<ref name=\"comune\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/chiese/231-chiesa-del-ges%C3%B9.html |title=Comune di Alcamo - \"Chiesa del Ges\u00f9\" |access-date=2016-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130172924/http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/chiese/231-chiesa-del-ges%C3%B9.html |archive-date=2016-01-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref> which lasted 80 years on the whole, so people called it \"the Church of Patching\".\n\nIn 2014 they made some restoration works on the [[fa\u00e7ade]].<ref>[http://www.trapaniok.it/7341/Cronaca-trapani/alcamo-comune---ultimati-i-lavori-di-messa-in-sicurezza-della-chiesa-del-collegio-del-gesu-#.VqajlfDJeQk TrapaniOK.it - Alcamo Comune - Ultimati i lavori di messa in sicurezza della chiesa del Collegio del Ges\u00f9]</ref><ref>[http://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-chiesa-collegio-via-ai-lavori/#.Vqaou_DJeQk AlpaUno - Alcamo: chiesa Collegio, via ai lavori]</ref>\n\nIn 1748 there was already existing the Congregation of the Maestranza of Rope Makers, probably taking part in the secret Congregation of the [[Nativity of the Virgin Mary]]; as their [[patron]], they venerated [[Christ]] tied to a column,<ref>Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.136, Alcamo, ed.

There are five niches on this fa\u00e7ade and they contain the statues of saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Saint Francis Xavier]], [[Our Lady of Miracles]] (the patroness saint of Alcamo) and the [[archangel Michael]] and [[Raphael]]. In 1931 the three statues which are placed in the lower part were restored (free of charge) by Giuseppe Bambina, a sculptor from Alcamo. It was necessary to restore them because of the damage provoked by [[Garibaldi]]'s troops that threw stones and shot their guns against them when they entered the town on 17 May 1860.\n \nIn 1989 they placed a clock above the central [[balcony]]: operated by a [[remote control]], it substituted an older one that decorated the [[Bell tower]] of the [[Mother Church]] of Alcamo before, while on the sides there are two [[bell towers]] surmounted by triangular cusps.<ref name=\"comune\"/> Inside one of the [[belfry (architecture)|belfries]] there are three bells \"Saint Ignatius of Loyola\", \"Saint Francis Xavier\" and \"Monstrance Holy Heart of Jesus\". On the top of the fa\u00e7ade there is a marble crown in memory of the Spanish domination of [[Sicily]].\n\nThere are two entrances: the main one is in piazza Ciullo and the side one in via Mazzini. The main entrance has got a stone [[stairway]] (called \"pietra di li Carrubbazzi\" by people'').<ref name=\"facc\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Facciponte|intervista allo scultore Giuseppe Bambina}}</ref>\n\nThe church's plan is with one [[nave]]<ref name=\"comune\"/> overtopped by a [[barrel vault]]. The walls and the [[apse]] are embellished by stuccoes (cornices and wallpapers) in [[Rococo style]], completed in 1767 (the year in which the Jesuits were expelled from this Church), maybe realized by Giovanni and Francesco Russo, who were [[Lorenzo Curti]]'s assistants when young.\n\nThe present [[dome]] was made in 1962; below it there was a [[headstone]] with the letters \"P X\" (missing today) indicating the entrance to the [[Crypt]] expanding six metres deep towards the high altar, where they buried the members of the [[Society of Jesus]] who had deceased.\n\nOn the high altar there is a painting made in 1797 by [[Giuseppe Renda]], a painter from Alcamo, entitled ''Jesus' Circumcision (La circoncisione di Ges\u00f9)''.<ref name=\"comune\"/> The altar is enlighted by [[stained glass]] windows from the top. In the central one Jesus is represented with his open hands.\n\n[[File:Chiesa del Collegio dei Gesuiti (Alcamo) 090.jpg|thumb|The high altar.]]\n\nInside the Church there are four chapels, the bigger ones are placed instead of the [[Transept]].

It is the second largest church in Alcamo, after the basilica di Santa Maria Assunta,\n\n== History ==\nThe church's construction began in 1684, thanks to the savings made by the [[Jesuits]] who built it on a piece of land given by the [[Town Council]]; in exchange for it, they undertook to make several building improvements at their own expenses, in particular:\n\n* The addition of six steps to Porta Stella, through which people entered the walled town;\n* The fixing of the water piping which took the water of the spring outside the town walls to the fountain used as a drinking trough; they had to move it from [[piazza Ciullo]] and place it in the new site next to the main tower of the [[ditch]] (corresponding to the present via Mazzini). In this manner they diverted the way that animals crossed to water: it was necessary to do that because after the construction of the '''Church of Jesus''' their transit would have been obstructed. \n[[File:Chiesa_del_Collegio_dei_Gesuiti_(Alcamo)_071.jpg|left|thumb|The Jesuits' emblem represented in a marble inlay inside the Church.]]\nOn 7 June 1725 Father Vincenzo Monteleone from Alcamo, who was the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the Jesuits' College, was appointed as the procurator for the building of this Church which in that period reached only the height of 8 palms on the western side, opposite the town walls.\n\nOn 29 July 1764 they inaugurated the Church with a solemn ceremony; later they decorated it with [[stucco]]es and in 1767 completed its construction,<ref name=\"comune\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/chiese/231-chiesa-del-ges%C3%B9.html |title=Comune di Alcamo - \"Chiesa del Ges\u00f9\" |access-date=2016-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130172924/http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/chiese/231-chiesa-del-ges%C3%B9.html |archive-date=2016-01-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref> which lasted 80 years on the whole, so people called it \"the Church of Patching\".\n\nIn 2014 they made some restoration works on the [[fa\u00e7ade]].<ref>[http://www.trapaniok.it/7341/Cronaca-trapani/alcamo-comune---ultimati-i-lavori-di-messa-in-sicurezza-della-chiesa-del-collegio-del-gesu-#.VqajlfDJeQk TrapaniOK.it - Alcamo Comune - Ultimati i lavori di messa in sicurezza della chiesa del Collegio del Ges\u00f9]</ref><ref>[http://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-chiesa-collegio-via-ai-lavori/#.Vqaou_DJeQk AlpaUno - Alcamo: chiesa Collegio, via ai lavori]</ref>\n\nIn 1748 there was already existing the Congregation of the Maestranza of Rope Makers, probably taking part in the secret Congregation of the [[Nativity of the Virgin Mary]]; as their [[patron]], they venerated [[Christ]] tied to a column,<ref>Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.136, Alcamo, ed.

There are five niches on this fa\u00e7ade and they contain the statues of saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Saint Francis Xavier]], [[Our Lady of Miracles]] (the patroness saint of Alcamo) and the [[archangel Michael]] and [[Raphael]]. In 1931 the three statues which are placed in the lower part were restored (free of charge) by Giuseppe Bambina, a sculptor from Alcamo. It was necessary to restore them because of the damage provoked by [[Garibaldi]]'s troops that threw stones and shot their guns against them when they entered the town on 17 May 1860.\n \nIn 1989 they placed a clock above the central [[balcony]]: operated by a [[remote control]], it substituted an older one that decorated the [[Bell tower]] of the [[Mother Church]] of Alcamo before, while on the sides there are two [[bell towers]] surmounted by triangular cusps.<ref name=\"comune\"/> Inside one of the [[belfry (architecture)|belfries]] there are three bells \"Saint Ignatius of Loyola\", \"Saint Francis Xavier\" and \"Monstrance Holy Heart of Jesus\". On the top of the fa\u00e7ade there is a marble crown in memory of the Spanish domination of [[Sicily]].\n\nThere are two entrances: the main one is in piazza Ciullo and the side one in via Mazzini. The main entrance has got a stone [[stairway]] (called \"pietra di li Carrubbazzi\" by people'').<ref name=\"facc\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Facciponte|intervista allo scultore Giuseppe Bambina}}</ref>\n\nThe church's plan is with one [[nave]]<ref name=\"comune\"/> overtopped by a [[barrel vault]]. The walls and the [[apse]] are embellished by stuccoes (cornices and wallpapers) in [[Rococo style]], completed in 1767 (the year in which the Jesuits were expelled from this Church), maybe realized by Giovanni and Francesco Russo, who were [[Lorenzo Curti]]'s assistants when young.\n\nThe present [[dome]] was made in 1962; below it there was a [[headstone]] with the letters \"P X\" (missing today) indicating the entrance to the [[Crypt]] expanding six metres deep towards the high altar, where they buried the members of the [[Society of Jesus]] who had deceased.\n\nOn the high altar there is a painting made in 1797 by [[Giuseppe Renda]], a painter from Alcamo, entitled ''Jesus' Circumcision (La circoncisione di Ges\u00f9)''.<ref name=\"comune\"/> The altar is enlighted by [[stained glass]] windows from the top. In the central one Jesus is represented with his open hands.\n\n[[File:Chiesa del Collegio dei Gesuiti (Alcamo) 090.jpg|thumb|The high altar.]]\n\nInside the Church there are four chapels, the bigger ones are placed instead of the [[Transept]]. There are the following chapels:\n* That one on the left side of the high altar is dedicated to saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the Society of Jesus (1534);\n* The chapel on the right side of the high altar is dedicated to saint [[Francis Xavier]], co-founder of the Society.

This first line-up was known as The Rick Z Combo, and later known as Rick and the Raiders.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> When Kelly left for college, the Zehringers were joined by bassist [[Randy Jo Hobbs]], saxophonist Sean Michaels, and keyboardist Ronnie Brandon.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> This was the line-up that took the name of \"The McCoys\". Brandon left the group in 1965 and was replaced by Bobby Peterson on keyboards.\n\nTheir best-known hit is \"[[Hang On Sloopy]]\", which was [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1965|#1 in the United States]] in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in October 1965 and is the official rock song of the state of Ohio. It also is the unofficial fight song of the [[Ohio State University]] Buckeyes and can be heard being played at many Ohio State athletic events by the OSU bands. Sales of the single in the US alone were over one million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/193 193]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/193}}</ref> Other hits include a [[Top 40|top 10]] cover of \"[[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]]\" (''Billboard'' #7) and a top 40 cover of [[Ritchie Valens]]'s \"Come On, Let's Go\" (''Billboard'' #21).\n\nA cover of \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their version of \"Fever\", was a hit in the United Kingdom for [[The Merseys]] and later covered by [[David Bowie]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Its opening line, \"with your long blonde hair and eyes of blue\" was quoted by [[George Harrison]] in the fadeout of \"[[It's All Too Much]]\", featured on the 1969 soundtrack of ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.\n\n\"The McCoys\" performed as part of Murray the K's Christmas show on December 18,1965 at the Brooklyn Fox Theater. Also performing on the program were Peter & Gordon, Wilson Pickett, The Fortunes, The Moody Blues, The Toys, Lenny Welch, Cannibal and the Headhunters, The Vibrations, The Spinners, The O'Jays, Bloodless Revolutionaries, Patti Michaels, Bobby Diamond,and Diane Langan.<ref>[https://www.murraythek.com/show-lineups.html \"Murray the K's Live Show Talent Lineups\"]</ref>\n\nThe McCoys were being labeled as a [[bubblegum pop]] act, much to the disdain of the band. In 1967, after the death of [[Bert Berns|Bert Berns,]] The McCoys broke free from [[Bang Records]] in hopes of recording more serious music. They ended up signing a deal with [[Mercury Records]] and record their last two records, ''Infinite McCoys'' (1968), and ''Human Ball'' (1969). They were The McCoys' attempt at making psychedelic music that would appeal to the mature listeners of that time. Both were a commercial failure, and did not chart anywhere. \n\n\nThe two Zehringer brothers (then known as Rick Derringer and Randy Z) and Hobbs became [[Johnny Winter]]'s band for the albums ''[[Johnny Winter And]]'' and ''[[Live Johnny Winter And]]'' in 1970 and 1971 respectively.<ref name=\"Larkin\" /> As backing musicians, both Derringer and Hobbs contributed to Winter's later releases ''[[Still Alive and Well]]'' (1973), ''[[Saints & Sinners (Johnny Winter album)|Saints & Sinners]]'' (1974), and ''[[John Dawson Winter III]]'' (1974). Derringer and Hobbs later played with [[Edgar Winter]] as well as appeared on ''[[Together: Edgar Winter and Johnny Winter Live]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"Larkin\" /> Hobbs later toured with Johnny Winter, but without Derringer, on Winter's ''[[Captured Live!]]'' (1976). Derringer also played with [[Steely Dan]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] and formed bands such as DNA, with drummer [[Carmine Appice]].\n\nHobbs died of drug-related heart failure on 5 August 1993 (Derringer's birthday) at the age of 45. Peterson died in Gainesville, Florida on 21 July 1993 at the age of 47.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n|-\n!Year\n!Album\n![[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]\n!Record label\n|- \n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1965\n|align=left| ''[[Hang on Sloopy (album)|Hang on Sloopy]]''\n| 44\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Bang Records]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1966\n|align=left| ''You Make Me Feel So Good''\n| \u2013\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1968\n|align=left| ''Infinite McCoys''\n| \u2013\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Mercury Records]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1969\n|align=left| ''Human Ball''\n| \u2013\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
