The initiative allows the State of Ohio to pursue a pay-for-success approach to address issues like addiction, infant mortality, criminal recidivism, water quality, and career readiness.

Few were hit harder than Ohio\u2019s farming community who, as a result, were faced with highly challenging planting and harvesting seasons. Treasurer Sprague re-opened the Ag-LINK application period in early July to provide farm operators and agribusinesses added support during a trying time. The second enrollment period saw 155 new and refinanced reduced interest loans being made available for a total of $18.3 million. Across both application periods for 2019, Ag-LINK helped 780 farmers and agribusinesses lower interest rates on loans adding up to $86.5 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/News/17253|title=Ag-LINK Provides Relief to Ohio Farmers During Tough Year|website=tos.ohio.gov/|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>  \n\n===Helping Families Navigate the Adoption Process===\nIn November 2019, joined by state Rep. [[Jon Cross]] (R \u2013 Kenton), Treasurer Sprague announced a proposal aimed at easing the financial barriers families often face while navigating the adoption process.  Under the Family Forward initiative, a new linked deposit program would be established to provide reduced interest loans to eligible families seeking adoption. By chipping away at the financial barriers that often inhibit the adoption process, the Ohio Treasurer\u2019s office can help families take shape and assist in welcoming children into loving homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/ohio-treasurer-working-to-ease-financial-burden-on-families-trying-to-adopt|title=Ohio treasurer working to ease financial burden on families trying to adopt|website=www.abc6onyourside.com|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\n===Empowering People through STABLE Accounts===\nUpon entering office, Treasurer Sprague made it a priority to revamp and broaden outreach strategies around the STABLE Account program. This approach resulted in a 51% jump in program participation during his first year in office. In 2019, an effort was launched to empower and assist employers with  offering eligible employees a direct deposit option for opening and contributing to a STABLE Account. This led to new partnerships with the State of Ohio, the City of Cincinnati, and [[Edison State Community College]]. In November 2019, the program had crossed the $100 million mark for total contributions received.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/files/2019_Annual_Report_updated.pdf|title=2019 Ohio Treasurer Annual Report|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>   \n\n===Supporting Local Governments===\nUnder Treasurer Sprague\u2019s watch, the State Treasury Asset Reserve (STAR) of Ohio set new all-time highs twice between July 2019 to February 2020 ($13,819,629,879.48 and $13,851,926,775.83).

Gov. [[Jon Husted]] announced a joint initiative to ensure OhioCheckbook.com remains a valued and available resource for years to come. Through the partnership, day-to-day management of OhioCheckbook.com will be administered in collaboration between the Ohio Treasurer\u2019s office and the Office of Budget and Management (OBM) with the support of the Office of Information Technology (OIT). By re-imagining and improving the online transparency tool, Treasurer Sprague is eliminating duplication, bolstering efficiencies, and ensuring transparency remains at taxpayers\u2019 fingertips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/News/17251|title=Husted, Sprague Announce New OhioCheckbook.com Partnership|website=tos.ohio.gov/|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>  \n\n===ResultsOHIO===\nIn July 2019, Treasurer Sprague saw passage of his first priority initiative, ResultsOHIO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/News/16224|title=Statement from Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague|website=tos.ohio.gov/|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> ResultsOHIO was established to change the way government combats certain social and public health challenges facing Ohio. The initiative allows the State of Ohio to pursue a pay-for-success approach to address issues like addiction, infant mortality, criminal recidivism, water quality, and career readiness. Once fully implemented, the program will enable state and local governments to tackle these challenges through innovative solutions while reducing the reliance on taxpayer dollars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190705/ohio-treasurers-program-leverages-private-funds-to-tackle-thorny-social-issues|title=Ohio treasurer\u2019s program leverages private funds to tackle thorny social issues|website=www.dispatch.com/|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\n===Farmers and Agriculture===\nExtreme weather took a devastating toll on parts of Ohio in late spring 2019. Few were hit harder than Ohio\u2019s farming community who, as a result, were faced with highly challenging planting and harvesting seasons. Treasurer Sprague re-opened the Ag-LINK application period in early July to provide farm operators and agribusinesses added support during a trying time. The second enrollment period saw 155 new and refinanced reduced interest loans being made available for a total of $18.3 million. Across both application periods for 2019, Ag-LINK helped 780 farmers and agribusinesses lower interest rates on loans adding up to $86.5 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/News/17253|title=Ag-LINK Provides Relief to Ohio Farmers During Tough Year|website=tos.ohio.gov/|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>  \n\n===Helping Families Navigate the Adoption Process===\nIn November 2019, joined by state Rep. [[Jon Cross]] (R \u2013 Kenton), Treasurer Sprague announced a proposal aimed at easing the financial barriers families often face while navigating the adoption process.  Under the Family Forward initiative, a new linked deposit program would be established to provide reduced interest loans to eligible families seeking adoption. By chipping away at the financial barriers that often inhibit the adoption process, the Ohio Treasurer\u2019s office can help families take shape and assist in welcoming children into loving homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/ohio-treasurer-working-to-ease-financial-burden-on-families-trying-to-adopt|title=Ohio treasurer working to ease financial burden on families trying to adopt|website=www.abc6onyourside.com|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\n===Empowering People through STABLE Accounts===\nUpon entering office, Treasurer Sprague made it a priority to revamp and broaden outreach strategies around the STABLE Account program. This approach resulted in a 51% jump in program participation during his first year in office. In 2019, an effort was launched to empower and assist employers with  offering eligible employees a direct deposit option for opening and contributing to a STABLE Account. This led to new partnerships with the State of Ohio, the City of Cincinnati, and [[Edison State Community College]]. In November 2019, the program had crossed the $100 million mark for total contributions received.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tos.ohio.gov/files/2019_Annual_Report_updated.pdf|title=2019 Ohio Treasurer Annual Report|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>   \n\n===Supporting Local Governments===\nUnder Treasurer Sprague\u2019s watch, the State Treasury Asset Reserve (STAR) of Ohio set new all-time highs twice between July 2019 to February 2020 ($13,819,629,879.48 and $13,851,926,775.83).

Circa 1997 the city made the downtown more pedestrian-friendly by narrowing West Nine Mile Road, the heart of the downtown, to one lane in each direction and adding on-street parking.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20070515/metro/108010011/Funky-Ferndale |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707203715/http://detnews.com/article/20070515/metro/108010011/Funky-Ferndale |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-07 |title=Funky Ferndale &#124; The Detroit News &#124; detroitnews.com |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2013-12-04 }}</ref> The result has been a return of pedestrian traffic and an influx of new stores and restaurants. The city has continued to make itself more accessible to people by reducing traffic lanes on Hilton Road and Pinecrest Road, two major local north/south streets, and adding bicycle lanes.\n\n== Government ==\n\nFerndale utilizes the council-manager form of government, and is governed by a city council consisting of a mayor and four council members. The city council appoints a city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city. The current mayor of Ferndale is Melanie Piana. Current city council members are Raylon Leaks-May, who is also Mayor Pro Tem, Greg Pawlica, Kat Bruner-James and Laura Mikulski.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 19,900.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Ferndale city, Michigan |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=August 18, 2011 }}</ref>\nFerndale is well known in the Detroit area for its [[LGBT]] population and progressive policies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Case |first=Wendy |url=http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=10562 |title=Affirming Ferndale |newspaper=Metro Times |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were early inhabitants of the area now known as the City of Ferndale. In the 1800s farmers began cultivating the land. After the invention of the automobile and the development of the automotive [[assembly line]], the population of Ferndale increased rapidly.<ref name=\"ferndale-mi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ferndale-mi.com/Community/History.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060418153632/http://www.ferndale-mi.com/Community/History.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2006 |title=History, Community, City of Ferndale, Michigan |accessdate=April 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nFerndale was incorporated into a village in 1918.<ref name=\"ferndale-mi1\"/> It was then incorporated into a city on March 7, 1927, by vote of the citizens of the village.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ferndalehistoricalsociety.org/history_chronology.html | title = Ferndale Historical Society - History: Chronology of Ferndale | accessdate = April 18, 2010 }}</ref> It became a [[bedroom community]] for [[Detroit]] workers, with most of its growth in housing from 1920 to 1951. Through the early 1950s there were [[tram|trolley]] (interurban railroad) lines in the median strip of Woodward Avenue from downtown Detroit to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. These helped the northern suburbs of Detroit grow as bedroom communities as people could take the trolley to shop or work in Detroit.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ferndale suburban community emerged as a place for families to raise children during the \"[[Baby Boom]]\" era, with its elementary schools, a downtown, city parks, active churches and civic groups.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.st-james.org/?page_id=25 | title = History of St. James Church | accessdate = February 20, 2011 }}</ref> [[Ferndale High School (Michigan)|Ferndale High]] was completed in 1958.\n\nFerndale's downtown shopping area, 9&nbsp;Mile Road, featured many busy, popular stores in the 1940s to 1960s, but later went into decline, and many business closed. In recent decades, the downtown area has revitalized. Ferndale's downtown is formed by two major thoroughfares, Nine Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. Circa 1997 the city made the downtown more pedestrian-friendly by narrowing West Nine Mile Road, the heart of the downtown, to one lane in each direction and adding on-street parking.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20070515/metro/108010011/Funky-Ferndale |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707203715/http://detnews.com/article/20070515/metro/108010011/Funky-Ferndale |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-07 |title=Funky Ferndale &#124; The Detroit News &#124; detroitnews.com |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2013-12-04 }}</ref> The result has been a return of pedestrian traffic and an influx of new stores and restaurants. The city has continued to make itself more accessible to people by reducing traffic lanes on Hilton Road and Pinecrest Road, two major local north/south streets, and adding bicycle lanes.\n\n== Government ==\n\nFerndale utilizes the council-manager form of government, and is governed by a city council consisting of a mayor and four council members. The city council appoints a city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city. The current mayor of Ferndale is Melanie Piana. Current city council members are Raylon Leaks-May, who is also Mayor Pro Tem, Greg Pawlica, Kat Bruner-James and Laura Mikulski.

Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings 1932\u201333|page=96|first=Leon|last=Trotsky}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historians have associated planned economies with [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]s and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]], some argue{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment, therefore the further distinction of an administrative command economy emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]], highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy.<ref name=\"The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning\">{{cite book|last=Ellman|first=Michael|chapter=The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning|title=Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti|editor1-first= Saul|editor1-last=Estrin|editor2-first=Grzegorz W.|editor2-last=Ko\u0142odko|editor3-first=Milica|editor3-last=Uvali\u0107|location= New York|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-0-230-54697-4|page=22|quote=Realization of these facts led in the 1970s and 1980s to the development of new terms to describe what had previously been (and still were in United Nations publications) referred to as the 'centrally planned economies'.

[[Indicative planning]] is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities.

This difficulty was notably written about by economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the [[economic calculation problem]]<ref name=\"Mises\">{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=8 September 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|year=1990|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth.pdf}}</ref> and [[local knowledge problem]],<ref name=\"AER519-30\">Hayek, Friedrich A.

Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to [[subjective value theory]] while attacking the [[labor theory of value]], the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as [[spontaneous order]]. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan: \"Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals\".<ref name=tibor2001>{{cite book|last=Machan|first=R.

But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential [[economic power]] grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.<ref name=\"Hahnel, Robin 2002\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Economic instability ===\nStudies of [[Command economy|administrative command economies]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that contrary to the expectations of both groups they showed greater fluctuations in [[Output (economics)|output]] than market economies during the same period.<ref name=\"Economic Reforms in Polish Industry\">{{cite book|last=Zielinski|first=J.

The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically so that the use of the [[surplus product]] is controlled by the producers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feinstein|first=C.

[...] It was important to explode the primitive identification of central planning and socialism and to stress the instrumental character of planning.}}</ref> The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the [[socialist calculation debate]].\n\n== Computational economic planning ==\nIn their book ''Towards a New Socialism'' (1993), the computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the economist Allin Cottrell from the [[Wake Forest University]] claim to demonstrate how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.\n\nWhen the development of computer technology was still its early stages in 1971, the socialist [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|Allende administration]] of Chile launched [[Project Cybersyn]] to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The prototype-stage of the project showed promise when it was used to redirect supplies around a trucker's strike,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eden Medina|title=Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende's Chile|journal=J.

The former is a [[consumer economy]] designed to engender productivity while the latter is a [[shortage economy]] designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organized by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.\n\nOther literary portrayals of planned economies were [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', [[Ayn Rand]]'s dystopian story ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by ''We''. The difference is that it was a [[primitivist]] planned economy as opposed to the advanced technology of ''We'' or ''Brave New World''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Calculation in kind]]\n* [[Communist state]]\n* [[Communist economy]]\n* [[Dirigisme]]\n* [[Distributed economy]]\n* [[Economic democracy]]\n* [[Economic equilibrium]]\n* [[Economic calculation problem]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Horizontalidad]]\n* [[Inclusive democracy]]\n* [[Indicative planning]]\n* [[Industrial democracy]]\n* [[Input-output model]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Market economy]]\n* [[Marxism-Leninism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Social peer-to-peer processes#P2P economic system|Peer-to-peer economy]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Project Cybersyn]]\n* [[Public ownership]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist calculation debate]]\n* [[Socialist economy]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocracy]]\n* [[Workers' self-management|Self-managed economy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n; Case studies (Soviet-type economies)\n* [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]\n* [[Eastern Bloc economies]]\n* [[Economy of Cuba]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/18/archives/the-cuban-economy-how-it-works-the-economy-of-cuba-how-it-works.html|title=The Cuban Economy: How It Works|last=Crittenden|first=Ann|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Economy of North Korea]]\n* [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Five-year plans of China]] \n* [[OGAS]], a plan for creating a computer network to supervise the Soviet economy\n* [[Project Cybersyn]], a project for a computer network controlling the economy of Chile under [[Salvador Allende]]\n\n; Case studies (mixed-market economies)\n* [[Economy of India]]\n* [[Economy of Singapore]]\n* [[First Malaysia Plan]]\n* [[Five-year plans of Argentina]]\n* [[Five-year plans of South Korea]]\n* [[Dirigisme|Indicative planning in France]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* [[Michael Ellman|Ellman, Michael]] (2014).

Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings 1932\u201333|page=96|first=Leon|last=Trotsky}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historians have associated planned economies with [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]s and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]], some argue{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment, therefore the further distinction of an administrative command economy emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]], highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy.<ref name=\"The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning\">{{cite book|last=Ellman|first=Michael|chapter=The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning|title=Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti|editor1-first= Saul|editor1-last=Estrin|editor2-first=Grzegorz W.|editor2-last=Ko\u0142odko|editor3-first=Milica|editor3-last=Uvali\u0107|location= New York|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-0-230-54697-4|page=22|quote=Realization of these facts led in the 1970s and 1980s to the development of new terms to describe what had previously been (and still were in United Nations publications) referred to as the 'centrally planned economies'.

[[Indicative planning]] is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominantly market-oriented and mixed economies{{which|date=September 2018}} the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries, such as the aerospace industry. Mixed economies usually employ [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] planning while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.\n\nNote too the utilization of [[dirigisme]], or government direction of the economy through non-coercive means, as practiced in France and in Great Britain after [[World War II]].

This difficulty was notably written about by economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the [[economic calculation problem]]<ref name=\"Mises\">{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=8 September 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|year=1990|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth.pdf}}</ref> and [[local knowledge problem]],<ref name=\"AER519-30\">Hayek, Friedrich A.

Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to [[subjective value theory]] while attacking the [[labor theory of value]], the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as [[spontaneous order]]. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan: \"Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals\".<ref name=tibor2001>{{cite book|last=Machan|first=R.

But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential [[economic power]] grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.<ref name=\"Hahnel, Robin 2002\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Economic instability ===\nStudies of [[Command economy|administrative command economies]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that contrary to the expectations of both groups they showed greater fluctuations in [[Output (economics)|output]] than market economies during the same period.<ref name=\"Economic Reforms in Polish Industry\">{{cite book|last=Zielinski|first=J.

The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically so that the use of the [[surplus product]] is controlled by the producers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feinstein|first=C.

[...] It was important to explode the primitive identification of central planning and socialism and to stress the instrumental character of planning.}}</ref> The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the [[socialist calculation debate]].\n\n== Computational economic planning ==\nIn their book ''Towards a New Socialism'' (1993), the computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the economist Allin Cottrell from the [[Wake Forest University]] claim to demonstrate how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.\n\nWhen the development of computer technology was still its early stages in 1971, the socialist [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|Allende administration]] of Chile launched [[Project Cybersyn]] to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The prototype-stage of the project showed promise when it was used to redirect supplies around a trucker's strike,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eden Medina|title=Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende's Chile|journal=J.

The former is a [[consumer economy]] designed to engender productivity while the latter is a [[shortage economy]] designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organized by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.\n\nOther literary portrayals of planned economies were [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', [[Ayn Rand]]'s dystopian story ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by ''We''. The difference is that it was a [[primitivist]] planned economy as opposed to the advanced technology of ''We'' or ''Brave New World''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Calculation in kind]]\n* [[Communist state]]\n* [[Communist economy]]\n* [[Dirigisme]]\n* [[Distributed economy]]\n* [[Economic democracy]]\n* [[Economic equilibrium]]\n* [[Economic calculation problem]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Horizontalidad]]\n* [[Inclusive democracy]]\n* [[Indicative planning]]\n* [[Industrial democracy]]\n* [[Input-output model]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Market economy]]\n* [[Marxism-Leninism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Social peer-to-peer processes#P2P economic system|Peer-to-peer economy]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Project Cybersyn]]\n* [[Public ownership]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist calculation debate]]\n* [[Socialist economy]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocracy]]\n* [[Workers' self-management|Self-managed economy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n; Case studies (Soviet-type economies)\n* [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]\n* [[Eastern Bloc economies]]\n* [[Economy of Cuba]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/18/archives/the-cuban-economy-how-it-works-the-economy-of-cuba-how-it-works.html|title=The Cuban Economy: How It Works|last=Crittenden|first=Ann|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Economy of North Korea]]\n* [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Five-year plans of China]] \n* [[OGAS]], a plan for creating a computer network to supervise the Soviet economy\n* [[Project Cybersyn]], a project for a computer network controlling the economy of Chile under [[Salvador Allende]]\n\n; Case studies (mixed-market economies)\n* [[Economy of India]]\n* [[Economy of Singapore]]\n* [[First Malaysia Plan]]\n* [[Five-year plans of Argentina]]\n* [[Five-year plans of South Korea]]\n* [[Dirigisme|Indicative planning in France]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* [[Michael Ellman|Ellman, Michael]] (2014).

He was the third vice president to die in office.\n\n== Early life ==\nKing was born in [[Sampson County, North Carolina]], to William King and Margaret deVane. His family was large, wealthy and well-connected. He graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1803, where he was also a member of the [[Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies|Philanthropic Society]]. Admitted to the bar in 1806 after reading the law with Judge William Duffy of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], he began practice in [[Clinton, North Carolina|Clinton]]. King was an ardent Freemason, and was a member of Fayetteville's Phoenix Lodge No. 8.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:William Rufus King..jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of King, circa 1840s]]\nKing entered politics and was elected as a member of the [[North Carolina House of Commons]], where he served from 1807 to 1809, and he became city solicitor of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], in 1810. He was elected to the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth [[United States Congress|Congresses]], serving from March 4, 1811, until November 4, 1816, when he resigned to become Secretary of the [[Legation]] for [[William Pinkney]] during Pinkney's appointment as [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]] and special diplomatic mission in [[Naples]]. He was only 25 years old when he became a congressman for the first time.\n\nWhen he returned to the United States in 1818, King joined the westward migration of the cotton culture to the Deep South, purchasing property at what would later be known as \"King's Bend\" between present-day [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] and [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]] on the [[Alabama River]] in [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]] of the new [[Alabama Territory]], which had been recently separated from [[Mississippi]]. He developed a large cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] based on slave labor, calling the property \"Chestnut Hill\". King and his relatives formed one of the largest [[slavery|slaveholding]] families in the state, collectively owning as many as 500 persons.\n\nWilliam Rufus King was a delegate to the convention which organized the [[History of Alabama|Alabama state government]]. Upon the admission of Alabama as the [[State of Alabama|twenty-second state]] in 1819 he was elected by the [[Alabama State Legislature|State Legislature]] as a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] to the [[United States Senate]].\n\nKing was a follower of [[Andrew Jackson]], and was reelected to the Senate as a [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] in 1822, 1828, 1834, and 1841, serving from December 14, 1819, until his resignation on April 15, 1844. During this time, in March\u2013April 1824, William R. King was honored with a single vote at the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] Caucus to be the party's candidate for the Office of [[U.S. Vice President]] for the upcoming [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]. Later he served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] during the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|24th]] through [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|27th]] Congresses. King was Chairman of the Senate's [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Lands|Committee on Public Lands]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce|Committee on Commerce]].\n\nHe was appointed as [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]], and served from 1844 to 1846. After his return, King resumed serving in the Senate, appointed and subsequently elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Arthur P. Bagby]]. He held his seat from July 1, 1848, until resigning because of ill health on December 20, 1852, after having been elected vice president.\n\nDuring the conflicts leading up to the [[Compromise of 1850]], King supported the Senate's [[gag rule]] against debate on antislavery petitions and opposed proposals to abolish slavery in the [[District of Columbia]], which was administered by Congress.<ref name=\"senate.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_William_R_King.htm|title=U.S. Senate: William Rufus King, 13th Vice President (1853)|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref> King supported a conservative, pro-slavery position, arguing that the [[Constitution]] protected the institution of slavery in both the Southern states and the [[Territories of the United States|federal territories]]. He opposed both the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]' efforts to abolish slavery in the territories as well as the \"[[Fire-Eaters]]\" calls for Southern [[secession]].<ref name=\"senate.gov\"/>\n\nOn July 11, 1850, two days after the death of [[U.S. President|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]], King was appointed Senate [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]]. Because [[Millard Fillmore]] ascended to the presidency, the vice presidency was vacant, making King first in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] under the law then in effect. He also served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations]] and the Committee on Pensions.\n\n== Relationship with James Buchanan ==\n[[File:JamesBuchanan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Buchanan]], (1791\u20131868), 15th [[President of the United States]] (served 1857\u20131861). He shared a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] boardinghouse with his friend and colleague, William R. King.]]\n\nThe argument for King's [[homosexuality]] has been put forward by biographer Jean Baker,<ref>Jean H.

Loewen, and Robert P. Watson, and focuses essentially on his close and intimate relationship with President [[James Buchanan]]. The two men lived together for 13 years from 1840 until King's death in 1853. Buchanan referred to the relationship as a \"communion\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Robert Watson, ''Affairs of State: The untold story of presidential love sex and scandal, 1789-1900'', Plymouth, 2012</ref> and the two often attended official functions together. Contemporaries also noted and commented upon the unusual closeness. [[Andrew Jackson]] mockingly called them \"Miss Nancy\" and \"Aunt Fancy\" (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man<ref>''The Wordsworth Book of Euphemisms'' by Judith S. Neaman and Carole G. Silver (Wordsworth Editions Ltd., Hertfordshire)</ref>), while [[Aaron V. Brown]] referred to King as Buchanan's \"better half\".<ref name=\"Baker 75\">[[#Baker|Baker (2004)]], p. 75.</ref> However, Lewis Saum, has argued that \"\u2026Customs and expressions were different in the mid-1800s than they are today...  \"Miss Nancy\" was \"a fairly common designation for people who wore clean clothes and had good manners\"; and noted that Aaron Brown was a political enemy of King.<ref>Lewis Suam, Pacific Northwest Quarterly, University of Washington, 2001</ref>\n\nLoewen has described Buchanan and King as \"siamese twins\". A biographer of James Knox Polk, Barzman wrote that \"King's \"fastidious habits and conspicuous intimacy with the bachelor Buchanan gave rise to some cruel jibes.\" Buchanan adopted King's mannerisms and romanticised view of southern culture. Both had strong political ambitions and in 1844 they planned to run as president and vice president. Both men were soft, effeminate and eccentric.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They spent some time apart while King was on overseas missions in France, and their letters remain cryptic, avoiding revealing any personal feelings at all. In May 1844, Buchanan wrote to Cornelia Roosevelt, \"I am now 'solitary and alone,' having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone, and [I] should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> After King died in 1853 Buchanan described him as \"among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Baker concluded that while some of their correspondence were destroyed by family members, the length and intimacy of surviving letters illustrate \"the affection of a special friendship\" between King and Buchanan, with no way to know for certain whether it was a romantic relationship.<ref>Jean H.

Because King was ill with tuberculosis and had traveled to [[Cuba]] in an effort to regain his health, he was not able to be in Washington to take his oath of office on March 4, 1853.

He was only 25 years old when he became a congressman for the first time.\n\nWhen he returned to the United States in 1818, King joined the westward migration of the cotton culture to the Deep South, purchasing property at what would later be known as \"King's Bend\" between present-day [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] and [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]] on the [[Alabama River]] in [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]] of the new [[Alabama Territory]], which had been recently separated from [[Mississippi]]. He developed a large cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] based on slave labor, calling the property \"Chestnut Hill\". King and his relatives formed one of the largest [[slavery|slaveholding]] families in the state, collectively owning as many as 500 persons.\n\nWilliam Rufus King was a delegate to the convention which organized the [[History of Alabama|Alabama state government]]. Upon the admission of Alabama as the [[State of Alabama|twenty-second state]] in 1819 he was elected by the [[Alabama State Legislature|State Legislature]] as a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] to the [[United States Senate]].\n\nKing was a follower of [[Andrew Jackson]], and was reelected to the Senate as a [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] in 1822, 1828, 1834, and 1841, serving from December 14, 1819, until his resignation on April 15, 1844. During this time, in March\u2013April 1824, William R. King was honored with a single vote at the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] Caucus to be the party's candidate for the Office of [[U.S. Vice President]] for the upcoming [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]. Later he served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] during the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|24th]] through [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|27th]] Congresses. King was Chairman of the Senate's [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Lands|Committee on Public Lands]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce|Committee on Commerce]].\n\nHe was appointed as [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]], and served from 1844 to 1846. After his return, King resumed serving in the Senate, appointed and subsequently elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Arthur P. Bagby]]. He held his seat from July 1, 1848, until resigning because of ill health on December 20, 1852, after having been elected vice president.\n\nDuring the conflicts leading up to the [[Compromise of 1850]], King supported the Senate's [[gag rule]] against debate on antislavery petitions and opposed proposals to abolish slavery in the [[District of Columbia]], which was administered by Congress.<ref name=\"senate.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_William_R_King.htm|title=U.S. Senate: William Rufus King, 13th Vice President (1853)|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref> King supported a conservative, pro-slavery position, arguing that the [[Constitution]] protected the institution of slavery in both the Southern states and the [[Territories of the United States|federal territories]]. He opposed both the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]' efforts to abolish slavery in the territories as well as the \"[[Fire-Eaters]]\" calls for Southern [[secession]].<ref name=\"senate.gov\"/>\n\nOn July 11, 1850, two days after the death of [[U.S. President|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]], King was appointed Senate [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]]. Because [[Millard Fillmore]] ascended to the presidency, the vice presidency was vacant, making King first in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] under the law then in effect. He also served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations]] and the Committee on Pensions.\n\n== Relationship with James Buchanan ==\n[[File:JamesBuchanan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Buchanan]], (1791\u20131868), 15th [[President of the United States]] (served 1857\u20131861). He shared a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] boardinghouse with his friend and colleague, William R. King.]]\n\nThe argument for King's [[homosexuality]] has been put forward by biographer Jean Baker,<ref>Jean H. Baker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wQeVkzfTJcEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22james+Buchanan%22+%22william+r+king%22+baker+communion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YtICUdSlDIT-9QTv54DoCw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=communion&f=false James Buchanan: The American Presidents Series: The 15th President, 1857\u20131861], 2004, page 26</ref> supported by Shelley Ross, James W. Loewen, and Robert P. Watson, and focuses essentially on his close and intimate relationship with President [[James Buchanan]]. The two men lived together for 13 years from 1840 until King's death in 1853. Buchanan referred to the relationship as a \"communion\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Robert Watson, ''Affairs of State: The untold story of presidential love sex and scandal, 1789-1900'', Plymouth, 2012</ref> and the two often attended official functions together. Contemporaries also noted and commented upon the unusual closeness. [[Andrew Jackson]] mockingly called them \"Miss Nancy\" and \"Aunt Fancy\" (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man<ref>''The Wordsworth Book of Euphemisms'' by Judith S. Neaman and Carole G. Silver (Wordsworth Editions Ltd., Hertfordshire)</ref>), while [[Aaron V. Brown]] referred to King as Buchanan's \"better half\".<ref name=\"Baker 75\">[[#Baker|Baker (2004)]], p. 75.</ref> However, Lewis Saum, has argued that \"\u2026Customs and expressions were different in the mid-1800s than they are today...  \"Miss Nancy\" was \"a fairly common designation for people who wore clean clothes and had good manners\"; and noted that Aaron Brown was a political enemy of King.<ref>Lewis Suam, Pacific Northwest Quarterly, University of Washington, 2001</ref>\n\nLoewen has described Buchanan and King as \"siamese twins\". A biographer of James Knox Polk, Barzman wrote that \"King's \"fastidious habits and conspicuous intimacy with the bachelor Buchanan gave rise to some cruel jibes.\" Buchanan adopted King's mannerisms and romanticised view of southern culture. Both had strong political ambitions and in 1844 they planned to run as president and vice president. Both men were soft, effeminate and eccentric.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They spent some time apart while King was on overseas missions in France, and their letters remain cryptic, avoiding revealing any personal feelings at all. In May 1844, Buchanan wrote to Cornelia Roosevelt, \"I am now 'solitary and alone,' having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone, and [I] should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> After King died in 1853 Buchanan described him as \"among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Baker concluded that while some of their correspondence were destroyed by family members, the length and intimacy of surviving letters illustrate \"the affection of a special friendship\" between King and Buchanan, with no way to know for certain whether it was a romantic relationship.<ref>Jean H. Baker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KoTpWjUsP1sC&pg=PA26 James Buchanan: The American Presidents Series: The 15th President, 1857&ndash;1861], 2004, pages 25&ndash;26</ref>\n\n== Vice presidency and death ==\n\n[[File:William R.

Because King was ill with tuberculosis and had traveled to [[Cuba]] in an effort to regain his health, he was not able to be in Washington to take his oath of office on March 4, 1853.

Moore House''', also known as the '''Moore-Dugal Residence''', is a house designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The house was built one block south of [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home and studio]] at 333 Forest Avenue in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. It was originally completed in 1895 in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style at the request of client Nathan Moore. Wright obliged his client's wishes, but long after disliked the house for its adherence to historical styles.\n\nA 1922 fire gave Wright the opportunity to redesign the house. The structure was completely rebuilt above the first or lowest floor in a manner in keeping with Wright's other works of the late 1910s and early 1920s. While the new design stayed evocative of Tudor architecture, the house was heavily ornamented by details of [[Sullivanesque]], [[Mayan architecture|Mayan]], and other exotic origins. Wright's second scheme remains largely intact today and the house continues to be a private residence despite a brief period as a tour home.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1886, Nathan Grier Moore bought a small, wood-framed house on a 50 feet by 150 feet lot at the southwestern corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. Moore had been born in 1853 in [[Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania]] and had attended [[law school]] in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].{{dubious|there is not law school there|date=October 2018}} He had recently been hired into the office of Chicago [[lawyer|attorney]] John P. Wilson. However, Moore chose to reside in Oak Park with his wife Anna and first daughter Mary (born in 1883) instead of Chicago. The couple's second daughter, Marjorie, was born in 1889 while they lived in their first Oak Park house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=11}}<sup>\u2020</sup></ref>\n\n===First Wright design===\n\nNathan Moore purchased the neighboring lot to the south in 1891 after the previous house on that site had been destroyed by fire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=11}}</ref> He soon announced his intention to build a new home on his expanded property. Frank Lloyd Wright accounted in his autobiography that Moore had been approached by many architects, including [[Norman S. Patton]], before Wright himself was asked to design the project in 1894. Mr. and Mrs. Moore reportedly traveled to Wright's newly opened downtown Chicago studio in the [[Garrick Theater (Chicago)|Schindler Building]] to request his services rather than simply calling at the emerging architect's house across the street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\nMoore had apparently not come to Wright in admiration of his design style. According to Wright, he proclaimed that \"I don't want you to give us anything like the house you did for Winslow\" referring to the recently completed house that Wright had designed for [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|William Winslow]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]]. \"I don't want to go down backstreets to my morning train to avoid being laughed at.\" Moore then proceeded to show Wright pictures of English [[Timber framing|half-timber]] buildings as inspiration for the proposed dwelling. Wright was apprehensive to design a house in a historical style, but he accepted the commission because of his financial obligations to his family (as he said, his \"three children were now running around the streets without proper shoes\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore House I (East View).jpg|thumb|left|First Moore House as viewed from Forest Avenue (photograph taken in 1900)]]\n\nThe first plan proposed a remodel of the home Moore had bought in 1886. Plans changed and the existing structure was instead moved three lots west to front Superior Street. This made way for the construction of a three-story [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] house which was completed in 1895.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002b}}</ref> The three story structure was built tight against the northern lot line which allowed for maximum yard space to the south. Walls on the main floor were faced in golden-tan [[Roman brick]] while the upper floors were finished in typical, dark-stained half timbering over light [[stucco]]. A steep, [[gable]]d roof and two slender, tall, brick chimneys topped off the composition. The main house was [[Symmetry#In architecture|symmetrically]] proportioned with few exceptions \u2013 including the chimneys and window openings flanking the Superior Street entrance. A garage connected the residence to a garden house at the northwestern corner of the property. Wright also designed a matching [[stable]] building across an [[alley]] to the southwest. The interior was [[Panelling|paneled]] in dark wood yet was amply lit by bands of diamond-patterned, leaded [[casement window]]s which opened the rooms up to the south garden. Inside also featured eight fireplaces, each with unique custom surrounds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lind|1996|p=46}}</ref> ''(See more period images of the [http://www.dgunning.org/architecture/ForestAve/mooreold.html first Moore House]).''\n\nNathan and Anna Moore \"were delighted with the house.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref> Unfortunately the same cannot have been said for Wright. He came to regard the design with embarrassment and admitted that his \"heart wasn't in it.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=59}}</ref> His decision caused further regret after he was asked on more than one occasion to devise similar Tudor inspired houses for other clients.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref> Like his mentor and former employer, [[Louis Sullivan|Louis H. Sullivan]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1979|pp=227\u2013230}}; Sullivan saw historical architecture as a result of culture, rather than a series of styles. He thus believed that modern architecture should represent the ideas of the current era rather than replicate the past.</ref> Wright considered the copying of historic styles to be \"uncreative\" and completely contrary to American freedom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114,117}}</ref> Even so, Wright managed to work a few interpretive deviations into the design of the Moore House. These included a broad, south-facing porch complete with brick end piers, Sullivanesque details on the [[Baluster|balustrades]], and his signature bowl-shaped [[urns]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lind|1996|p=46}}</ref> \"It was the first time...an English, half-timbered house ever saw a porch,\" Wright stated and further conceded that \"the porch was becoming to the house.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref>\n\n===Property expansion and Edward R. Hills House===\n\nSoon after the new house was finished, Moore resumed the expansion of his property. In 1900 he bought the house on a 100&nbsp;ft wide lot to the south from prior owner William C. Gray. That same year, Wright was rehired to remodel this recent purchase for Moore's eldest daughter. Actual construction waited until yet another house was acquired south of the former Gray house in 1905. This last house had been owned by a Mr. and Mrs. D.L. McDaniels. With an estate that now measured 250 feet by 150 feet, Moore was able to demolish the McDaniels house and move the Gray house south where it was subsequently refurbished and enlarged. The house, along with 60&nbsp;ft of Forest Avenue frontage, was deeded to Mary and her husband Edward Rowland Hills in 1910 ''(see also [[Edward R. Hills House]])''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002a}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Fire and second Wright design===\n\n[[File:Wright-House.jpg|thumb|\nNathan G. Moore House viewed from the corner of Superior Street and Forest Avenue.]]\n\nIn the early morning of December 23, 1922, an electrical fire destroyed the third floor and caused significant damage to the lower floors of the Nathan G. Moore House. At the time, Wright was engaged in the construction of several projects in [[California]], but he accepted Moore's request to design the reconstruction and appointed [[Charles E. White, Jr.]] as local coordinator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002b}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Thomson|2000|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> Within a year the house was again ready to be occupied.\n\nWhile Wright took this opportunity to completely redesign the house, he retained the essence of the Tudor style. The foundations as well as most of the first floor walls and south porch were retained. A [[slate]] roof and masonry chimneys were rebuilt in almost identical form to the originals, but Wright chose to leave out the second floor walls. The new roof sat directly on the first floor, thus making the entire structure significantly shorter. The pitched roof of the previous porch was traded for a second floor [[terrace (building)|terrace]] with two open [[lightwell]]s to the porch below.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Thomson|2000|pp=379\u2013380}}</ref>\n\nThis second house was more imbued with integral [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] than the first. A simple, first floor [[bay window]] in the east elevation was exchanged for one with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] motif. Each side featured paired [[lancet window]]s and a facing of intricately adorned [[terracotta]]. While half-timbering was limited to the peaks of three gables, the remaining surfaces were replaced by banding of terracotta and heavily carved, geometrically patterned wood. In these details, Wright not only drew inspiration from English Tudor, but also from [[Mayan architecture]] and the elaborate, organic style of Louis Sullivan.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=59}}</ref> The result showed similarities to other Wright designs of the period, including [[Midway Gardens]] (1913), the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (1915\u201323), the [[Hollyhock House]] (1917\u20131921), and the four [[textile block house]]s (1923).<ref>{{Harvnb|Lind|1996|p=46}}</ref> The stables and garden house, which both survived the fire and retained original detailing, serve as a comparison between the styles of the earlier and later designs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=59}}</ref>\n\n===1946 to present===\n\nOn August 16, 1946, Nathan Moore died; his house and property were left to Mary Hills. The Hills did not keep the estate, but instead sold it the following June to Milton J. and Mary Summerville. During the transaction, the Hills retained the southern 40 feet of land to expand their own narrow lot.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002a}}</ref> The home is currently owned by Bob Dugal who opened the house for seasonal public tours. However, these tours ceased operation in 2001 due to the progression of Dugal's [[Friedreich's ataxia]] disease.<ref>{{Harvnb|Trainor|2009}}</ref>\n\n{{Commons category|Nathan G.

Moore House''', also known as the '''Moore-Dugal Residence''', is a house designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The house was built one block south of [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home and studio]] at 333 Forest Avenue in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. It was originally completed in 1895 in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style at the request of client Nathan Moore. Wright obliged his client's wishes, but long after disliked the house for its adherence to historical styles.\n\nA 1922 fire gave Wright the opportunity to redesign the house. The structure was completely rebuilt above the first or lowest floor in a manner in keeping with Wright's other works of the late 1910s and early 1920s. While the new design stayed evocative of Tudor architecture, the house was heavily ornamented by details of [[Sullivanesque]], [[Mayan architecture|Mayan]], and other exotic origins. Wright's second scheme remains largely intact today and the house continues to be a private residence despite a brief period as a tour home.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1886, Nathan Grier Moore bought a small, wood-framed house on a 50 feet by 150 feet lot at the southwestern corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. Moore had been born in 1853 in [[Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania]] and had attended [[law school]] in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].{{dubious|there is not law school there|date=October 2018}} He had recently been hired into the office of Chicago [[lawyer|attorney]] John P. Wilson. However, Moore chose to reside in Oak Park with his wife Anna and first daughter Mary (born in 1883) instead of Chicago. The couple's second daughter, Marjorie, was born in 1889 while they lived in their first Oak Park house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=11}}<sup>\u2020</sup></ref>\n\n===First Wright design===\n\nNathan Moore purchased the neighboring lot to the south in 1891 after the previous house on that site had been destroyed by fire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=11}}</ref> He soon announced his intention to build a new home on his expanded property. Frank Lloyd Wright accounted in his autobiography that Moore had been approached by many architects, including [[Norman S. Patton]], before Wright himself was asked to design the project in 1894. Mr. and Mrs. Moore reportedly traveled to Wright's newly opened downtown Chicago studio in the [[Garrick Theater (Chicago)|Schindler Building]] to request his services rather than simply calling at the emerging architect's house across the street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\nMoore had apparently not come to Wright in admiration of his design style. According to Wright, he proclaimed that \"I don't want you to give us anything like the house you did for Winslow\" referring to the recently completed house that Wright had designed for [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|William Winslow]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]]. \"I don't want to go down backstreets to my morning train to avoid being laughed at.\" Moore then proceeded to show Wright pictures of English [[Timber framing|half-timber]] buildings as inspiration for the proposed dwelling. Wright was apprehensive to design a house in a historical style, but he accepted the commission because of his financial obligations to his family (as he said, his \"three children were now running around the streets without proper shoes\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore House I (East View).jpg|thumb|left|First Moore House as viewed from Forest Avenue (photograph taken in 1900)]]\n\nThe first plan proposed a remodel of the home Moore had bought in 1886. Plans changed and the existing structure was instead moved three lots west to front Superior Street. This made way for the construction of a three-story [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] house which was completed in 1895.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002b}}</ref> The three story structure was built tight against the northern lot line which allowed for maximum yard space to the south. Walls on the main floor were faced in golden-tan [[Roman brick]] while the upper floors were finished in typical, dark-stained half timbering over light [[stucco]]. A steep, [[gable]]d roof and two slender, tall, brick chimneys topped off the composition. The main house was [[Symmetry#In architecture|symmetrically]] proportioned with few exceptions \u2013 including the chimneys and window openings flanking the Superior Street entrance. A garage connected the residence to a garden house at the northwestern corner of the property. Wright also designed a matching [[stable]] building across an [[alley]] to the southwest. The interior was [[Panelling|paneled]] in dark wood yet was amply lit by bands of diamond-patterned, leaded [[casement window]]s which opened the rooms up to the south garden. Inside also featured eight fireplaces, each with unique custom surrounds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lind|1996|p=46}}</ref> ''(See more period images of the [http://www.dgunning.org/architecture/ForestAve/mooreold.html first Moore House]).''\n\nNathan and Anna Moore \"were delighted with the house.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref> Unfortunately the same cannot have been said for Wright. He came to regard the design with embarrassment and admitted that his \"heart wasn't it.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=59}}</ref> His decision caused further regret after he was asked on more than one occasion to devise similar Tudor inspired houses for other clients.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref> Like his mentor and former employer, [[Louis Sullivan|Louis H. Sullivan]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1979|pp=227\u2013230}}; Sullivan saw historical architecture as a result of culture, rather than a series of styles. He thus believed that modern architecture should represent the ideas of the current era rather than replicate the past.</ref> Wright considered the copying of historic styles to be \"uncreative\" and completely contrary to American freedom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114,117}}</ref> Even so, Wright managed to work a few interpretive deviations into the design of the Moore House. These included a broad, south-facing porch complete with brick end piers, Sullivanesque details on the [[Baluster|balustrades]], and his signature bowl-shaped [[urns]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lind|1996|p=46}}</ref> \"It was the first time...an English, half-timbered house ever saw a porch,\" Wright stated and further conceded that \"the porch was becoming to the house.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2005|p=117}}</ref>\n\n===Property expansion and Edward R. Hills House===\n\nSoon after the new house was finished, Moore resumed the expansion of his property. In 1900 he bought the house on a 100&nbsp;ft wide lot to the south from prior owner William C. Gray. That same year, Wright was rehired to remodel this recent purchase for Moore's eldest daughter. Actual construction waited until yet another house was acquired south of the former Gray house in 1905. This last house had been owned by a Mr. and Mrs. D.L. McDaniels. With an estate that now measured 250 feet by 150 feet, Moore was able to demolish the McDaniels house and move the Gray house south where it was subsequently refurbished and enlarged. The house, along with 60&nbsp;ft of Forest Avenue frontage, was deeded to Mary and her husband Edward Rowland Hills in 1910 ''(see also [[Edward R. Hills House]])''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunning|2002a}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Oak Park HPC|2002|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Fire and second Wright design===\n\n[[File:Wright-House.jpg|thumb|\nNathan G. Moore House viewed from the corner of Superior Street and Forest Avenue.]]\n\nIn the early morning of December 23, 1922, an electrical fire destroyed the third floor and caused significant damage to the lower floors of the Nathan G. Moore House. At the time, Wright was engaged in the construction of several projects in [[California]], but he accepted Moore's request to design the reconstruction and appointed [[Charles E.
